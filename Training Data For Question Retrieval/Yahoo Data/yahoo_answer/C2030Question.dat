20090128183239AARAaFB	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Need lens suggestion for my Rebel XSi?	Presently I have the kit 18-55 IS lens, would like to upgrade. Debating between:   Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM   Canon EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM       I fully realize you get what you pay for, optic wise, and some folks will spare no $$ when it comes to a good piece of all purpose glass for their bag. My question is, is the optical superiority of the 17-55 justify the almost double price?  I'm looking at amateur photography, novice hobbyist, some outdoor shots, portraits, walk-around type pictures as they present themselves.   I will spend up to 700-800 to get one great lens, but naturally would like to save a buck if the benefits are incrementally insignificant the increased cost as pertaining to the "perhaps not as demanding" shutterbug such as myself. I know that may sound contradictory, but I just dont want to overspend for quality I neither need nor appreciate but nor do I wish to fall short and realize as such as my knowledge base and photog hobby grows. ( BTW, also looking at  theTamron 17-50mm f/2.8 XR Di II ?)      Appreciate some informed input, pls not too analytical/techhie!!  lol. (heck, I've even considered keeping my kit lens and getting the acccompanying 55-250 IS, but I'm just still not too impressed w/ image quality as it stands w/ my pics from this lens)   .    Thnx in advance for suggestions, or perhaps a lens I'm overlooking

20090128183602AAJEtNJ	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Should I get 8GB iPod Touch?	Ive been debating with myself, should I get the 16GB or 8GB? the thing is ive been collecting my lunch money for a while (105 bucks so far, dont ask, i never eat lunch anyway) so i did a little calculation, and i saw that in total (with tax, and some money to buy a 20$ case for it) 269 bucks for the 8GB. but then the 16 GB was something like 350 bucks. since i get 20 bucks of lunch money per week, it would take me about 13 weeks (a little over 3 months) for the 8GB and the 16GB would take me about 17 weeks. Im not the really patient kind of person. Which one is better, and is it worth going 4 weeks more to get the 16GB?

20090128184628AAUrc00	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Should I get the camera or the cell phone?	Ok so I have a crisis. I got a digital camera for xmas but returned it because it broke. So now I have $90 to spend on a new camera or a new cell phone. I don't have a camera, but I do have a cell phone. However, I barely used my camera when I had one, and I want a phone with a keyboard for easy texting. So it's either an  AT&T Quickfire or a Canon Coolpix. One other thing is that the phone would cost me $40 extra. I think a camera would be more realistic because I really need one, but a new phone would be great!       What do you think I should get?      Thanks!!

20090128184558AAG8qWE	Consumer Electronics;TVs	My DVD player won't show up on my new LCD TV?	My father bought a new LCD TV series 5 530 from Samsung.    The problem is, we can't figure out how to make the DVD player work.    We are pretty sure the DVD player is well connected to the television, however, unlike our previous television, there is NO TV/video channel/mode on this television.      I doubt anyone would comprehend our situation... so to make it short, how do YOU play your DVD player on your LCD television?    For example (example with my old TV):   1-Open TV   2-Click on TV/Video   3-Open DVD player   4-Enjoy.      Or simply tell me what replaced the TV/Video thingy xD   Thank you.

When I confirm the send it goes on to say(are you sure it will be sent in multiple messages) so it sends.      My problem is that if i send it to (let's say t-mobile) the person will receive every part of it, but if i was to send it to my friend with sprint or verizon they only get the first part and vice versa. I have ATT      I think it may be because t-mobile and ATT both use sim cards whereas verizon doesn't

20090128194339AAqnu3z	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Sharing a T-Mobile Contract & Getting a New Phone?	My dad and I have cell phones on a family plan. He has a line and I have a line. For whatever reason this was the easiest way for me to get a phone and has been great for the past two years.      Unfortunately, today my phone broke in half and I need a phone ASAP. I called my dad to let him know I was getting a knew phone and he told me that I could get a new phone but that I could not extend his contract.      I was under the impression that each line was a separate entity and that if I extended my service to get a good deal on a phone it would not affect his contract.       How does this work? This is the first time I've ever dealt with this and I'm not sure what to do. How does one get a new phone when they share a "contract" with someone else? Does what I do with my line affect him in any way? If he wanted to leave the company, how would me still having a contract impact him?      Please help!

Is there anyway to combine them so I don't lose the points on one or the other?

20090128154211AAOZFEp	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	I need a new flash because of lens length, plus color.?	So I have this Nikon D40 which is all well and good, but with my 18-55 lens PLUS my fisheye attachment, the lens is about five inches long.         this causes anything I photograph to have a nice big fat shadow on it, cast by said lengthy lens.      Now I don't want to drop $200 on a Nikon speedlight. BUT! I have heard things about voltage and so on. Now I've been wanting one of those cute Holga 12MFC electronic flashes because it seems to me it doesn't have to be so RIDICULOUSLY huge, But I have no idea if it would work properly/fry my camera - I can't find the voltage specs.      also, I do have an old, practically antique Albinar 91 flash. It was bought for a film camera and does not seem to be recognized by my Nikon. At all. No idea what the voltage on that is, either.      I've had the Nikon SB400 flash suggested to me, but it doesn't seem like it would be tall enough to reach past the behemoth lenses. Also, I'd like to use color gels.      MY QUESTION IS:   Can I use the holga flashes?      and if not, is there some sort of adapter for the big one?      much thanks.

20090128174629AAg6mhN	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Do the current iPod Touches on sale have the update thing?	Sorry for the vague title. Anyway, I have an older iPod Touch. There was this update that came out or something that allows you to download some games from the iTunes Store for free, correct? However the update itself costs $10 or something. I don't have an actual iTunes Store account because I don't have a credit card and I was wandering, do the iPod Touches that are available now have that update already installed? I'm asking because, at the place where I bought my iPod, I can return it no questions asked for a full refund, and I would then repurchase an iPod Touch and I would hope I could get an iPod touch with that update so I could then get the games and such.      Also, you don't need to have an iTunes account to purchase those free games, do you? :( Thanks for the help in advice and sorry if my question is a little vague.

20090128190547AAnyPBo	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	With "rhapsody to go," will I still have to pay for songs before burning them?	The "Rhapsody" online music store is offering a subscription service called "Rhapsody to Go." One apparently receives access to all their tracks for full-length online streaming. However, I'm not clear on whether one must still pay, per track, in order to download a song and burn it to a CD or MP3 player. That's how it works at ITunes, etc..      So, will I have to pay extra, per track, in order to get music onto portable devices, or is this covered by this subscription plan? I'm just curious if any Rhapsody users know the answer to this question.       By the way, if anybody has general comments about Rhapsody, I'd be eager to hear them. I've always thought the RealNetworks company was a little shady sometimes and I'm not sure whether I should subscribe to Rhapsody. It looks very attractive.

I want to be on AT&T, and I can't afford a contract.  I don't like the selection of phones offered for prepaid service (GoPhone), but that's my only option.      Here's what it looks like I have to do:   (1) Buy a cheap GoPhone from WalMart, activate it, and then harvest the SIM card.   (2) Buy an unlocked phone (How do I do this?? Can I buy one at an AT&T retail store?? eBay?? What does "unlocked" mean? That's where I need some help...)   (3) Take the harvested SIM Card from the WalMart GoPhone, and put it in the phone that I purchased in Step 2.  (Right?)   Now, is my "Step 2" phone that original GoPhone technically?  How would I add minutes? Is the number the same?      Basically, I want a phone for GoPhone, but I want a phone that's not listed as a GoPhone.      Please help! Thank you! (Also, be sure to answer all of the question marks...I tried to make them stand out.  If you could make a list of steps that I would need to take to make this work, please do so.)

20090128191007AAetaDf	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	IPhone isn't what i thought it'd be?	For Christmas, I got an iPhone from my mom. I am 13. I asked for a Pantech Matrix, but she got me an iPhone, and thats even better. But, I am having a lot of problems. Since I'm a teenager, I like to be able to bluetooth ringtones, landscape text, send multimedia messages, and get on the internet without problems! The iPhone doesn't do any of these, and it sucks. I'd rather just have the cheaper pantech matrix, i don't really need the iPhone. I have a problem though, everytime I tell my mom I don't like something, she gets really mad and yells at me saying I don't appreciate anything, and then she'll be like Whatever you don't deserve it. I do appreciate she spent all this money on it, but I kind of think it's just a waste. I think the 30 day limit to exchange the phone is up, but I don't know if the apple company has a warranty. Can someone please give me advice?? About everything! How can I tell my mom? and are there any ways i can fix my iPhone?

This time it was inside the house, and it was dropped    on the carpet, so since it was a smooth drop it just open again.       But the cables or what ever their called, unhook from    their slots.       So i tried putting them back, when i got to the connecting    cable that comes from the battery to its slot on mainboard    it broke on the way in.      So my question is do they sell those cable's or do i have to    buy a new battery or something???      Also does the 5th Gen iPod Video Hard Drive fit the iTouch HDD?      Also what would be cheaper fixing it or getting a new one iPod?   It's an iPod Video, im asking this because my iPod has alot   of details now. So im not sure to what really do. And also    because i dont want to loose my music in my iPod.

Majic Jack Dangerous Puts Spyware On Computer - The Hidden Truth Behind Majic JackPosted problems with magic jack .... is majic jack hiding something?       read the tos ("terms of service) for magic jack very closely. you might be surprised at what you see there. or not see there. i've pointed out issues with magic jack in earler articles on broadband nation (see archives). but this revelation should make you very concerned.      in short ... to quote a favorite cartoon character .... "be afwaid, very afwaid".      this is just pointing out the not-so-obvious that is hidden deep within the tos, and other 'gotcha's' that you won't realize until after you give up your $ and privacy!      first:      here is the contact info for magicjack:      po box 6785   west palm beach, fl 33405      magic jack phone number: 281-404-1551   billing magicjack number: 561-594-2140      caution: it looks like they track the number that calls and places you into a repeating loop if you call back a second time. so if you need to call a second time make sure its from a different number.      second:      in the tos you agree that everything in your computer is fair game for them to know about, all web sites, email, and numbers called are there info.      you agree to have all of your information resold to third parties.      there is no un install for this program. even if you stop using it, it gathers your information.      you are put under high pressure to sign up and pay for 5 years.      there is no published phone number, email address, or mailing address.      all customer support is done via type in the box chat.      there is no written warranty on the box. it breaks, you buy another to maintain your service.      computer must be left on to make or receive calls.      pop up window comes to front of screen anytime there is a call in or out call.      majicjack spyware slows down your computer even when you are not using magicjack      advertising is in the pop up box.      and yes, you do save around $150 a year not using a real voip company.      at what little price people put on the information and security.      so ask yourself, is it really worth it?      wait .... there's more.      majic jack is owned and run by ymax. they are not a stand alone voip provider.       also .....       "the software for the magicjack does not run directly from the device. it fully installs on the windows system, which also makes the magicjack less attractive for situations where one might want to use it on someone else's computer (say when visiting family). making this even worse, there was no easy way to uninstall the software from the system, with the program not even showing up in the windows remove program window. update: magicjack confirmed that there is currently no easy way to uninstall the software. the process required to uninstall the software requires multiple windows registry edits and the removal of several folders on the windows system. based on this, i wouldn't recommend using the magicjack on the systems of friends, family or business associates." -- (see magicjack fails to cast a voip spell)       nobody should accept having to leave unwanted software on a personal computer, or any tell-tale trace of the mj program on a public computer, a business workstation, or a borrowed device.      the key concepts here are action and intent. if mj is not actively monitoring computer activity and collecting data about its customers, that's great. they would be taking no action that anyone could be concerned about.      but consider their intent. their tos spell out their intent -- the intent to feed context sensitive advertising, which requires manipulation of information from your brain through their software into their processors. there seems to be little restriction of what info their software can see. (kind of like your home builder installing bugging devices and cameras into your bedroom, just not yet watching the feed.) then there is the ability of mj to modify their software (upgrape, anyone?) at any time, without the common user's ability to stop it, and that revision could include the spyware coding. while you, the uncommon user, have the ability to see what they are doing, the common user has no idea when the change is made. now let's consider mj's intent of not building in an uninstall capability. i am suggesting that this exposes mj's intent to have their software on your pc whether you're an active phone customer or not. what would be the intent of having that software on the pc of a former customer? (consider, also, their "convenience" feature of taking the device with you so you can use it on a friend's pc -- thus installing the software on that machine, too!) what information could that software obtain that would be of value to mj? and what could the common user do to stop it?      mj could shut down their phone service tomorrow, and they have a window into 1 million pcs -- to feed advertising, log key strokes, and obtain surfing patterns.      by laughing at the tos provisio

20090128194745AA4zUBd	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	Good Home Theater in a Box (small satellites)?	I'm looking for recommendations for a 5.1 home-theater in a box type system for a formal-like living room to complement my LCD (I have shelves so mounting is no problem). I am looking in particular for a system much like the Bose V20 system how it doesn't have a complicated receiver (my whole family needs to be able to learn it easily) but rather can be done almost completely through the remote and also can program other sources to work with the remote well enough..      If nothing comes to mind with those specific criteria, just general suggestions are fine.      Price should be up to $2,000, but less is always nice.      I tried the Bose V20s and really enjoyed them.. They look nice, sound pretty good (Bose doesn't deserve the bad rep they have.. they're just a little bit different from others) and are easy to use. Plus all the components feel like quality. Plus I hear their service is great. I have various Bose things around my house and I am very impressed, however I wouldn't mind looking at other brands too.      Keep in mind that this is NOT for my home theater (I will get Martin Logans for that). Sound quality is obviously important but so are size and ease of use.      Thanks!

All of the pictures taken after I inserted the stranger's SD card went into the 145CANON folder.  I deleted the 145CANON folder and took another picture.  It still didn't fix the problem.      QUESTION: How do I fix this problem?  I want to stop my pictures from being numbered as 145-20xx and to continue with my original chronology of 100-40xx and onward.

However, I want one small enough to fit into my bedroom. I know that a lot of the smaller ones are in 720p, but I want one so that I can watch Blu Ray movies on there, as well as play my PS3 on and have the full definition. I don't mind playing the games or watching the movies on the TV I currently have, but I want the high-def experience. What's the smallest one? I wouldn't mind settling for 720p if I had no other choice.
20090128204419AANlS7o	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	D90 lens question - package deal?	I'm about to buy the D90 but i see a package deal with what i think is a better lens,  Help me decide please.      Basically I was going to get the noraml kit with nikkor lens.      Nikon D90 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED AF-S VR DX Nikkor Zoom Lens      link...    http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D90-Digital-...       but then i saw this package deal...      Nikon D90 Digital SLR Camera Body + Nikon 18-200mm VR Lens + 16GB Memory Card + Nikon EN-EL3e Battery + Case + Cameta Bonus Accessory Kit      link...    http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D90-Digital-...       Difference is about 500, is it worth it?   Does this lens do everything the other 1 would and more?   seems to me it does but this is my forst serious camera & i got lots to learn so I need to know for sure.      No matter what I'm going to stick with just 1 lens for a while, at least a year.   Also i wanted a 16GB Memory Card anyway & dont think the other package comes with that.  Figured by the time I added the little xtras id be halfway between the price diference anyway, so thinking maybe i should just get the better package.      Your thoughts please?   What else will I need that is not included depending on which choice i go with?    Battery Charger? anything?      Thanks!
