O servi?o, de segunda à sexta, por oito horas diárias, deverá lhe render salário de R$ 262, 50 mensais e redu??o de um dia em sua pena a cada três trabalhados, de acordo com a legisla??o brasileira.    Os últimos acertos devem ser feitos nesta semana pela dire??o da unidade. Anteriormente, Suzane havia trabalhado no ambulatório da mesma pris?o, agendando consultas, e com artesanato. De acordo com funcionárias da pris?o, o trabalho com prendedores de roupa é a op??o às detentas quando terminam as vagas nas outras oficinas, como corte e costura, enfermaria, cosméticos, tric? e crochê, além de servi?os internos.    "A Suzane está aguardando a decis?o da diretora do Centro de Ressocializa??o", afirmou Denivaldo Barni, ex-tutor da garota.
