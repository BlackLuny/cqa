This guy at school (hes like 19) that I sometimes hang out with, took my bracelet, wore it and left with it. (its not valuable, its a homemade smiley faced beaded one)   like we were standing there talking and i was playing with my bracelet and he took it from me and put it on his wrist...later i turned to talk to my other friends and he rolled down his sleeve and left.   I know he did it on purpose and before I could say anything he went to his class.   so what does this mean...if anything?

For the past 2 weeks I have become a little scared that he's just going to end it out of no where or that I am going to be hurt.  I stress over if he doesn't call or if I say the right thing or that he's going to get tired of me and then I worry more that I'm worrying and that must mean something.  I just wasn't like this until recently and its really for no reason.  Is it normal to go through this in a relationship?  Could it be the dreary cold weather makin me feel like crap and worry??

And im not to close with my family cuz i dont see them much anymore. But lately ive been very curious on wanting to see there accounts on facebook. So since i dont have my f/b account on yet i decided to make a fake account and it looks pretty real i guess except that since i only created it recently i only have 3 ppl as friends on there and that may make me look fake. And ive only added one person from my family wich is a group for the whole entire family with the same last name as each other.But on my facebook i put a different last name on then my family,but out of really big curiousty i decided 2 add them anyway. Thinking that they might think that i might know some1 from the family or something like that. But they didnt add me & just now someone from my family msged me saying "hi how are u doing?,and 4 what reason to u wanna join the group"? & i havent msged them back yet cuz idk if i should ever msg them back. & i was also thinking after around a month i should delet that account w/o ever msging them back. Or should i msg back saying oh yea my friend is related 2 u and cuz she doesnt have any acount yet she added u guys from my pg,    Also im really worried that they may know that its a fake pg or even worse somehow know im behind it cuz im the only 1 in the family that isnt to close with em no more. so what should i do???!   honestly

The other day my friend sent me an IM conversation he'd had with my other friend, wanting to know if I thought he'd been rude. He forgot that tacked on to the end of the conversation was this bit (I took parts out).      Mightyninjafrog is the one that sent me the conversation, sxekevyjsxe is the one I have the issue with (when he says 'them' in the conversation he is referring to me and some of my other friends)      sXeKevyJsXe (1:23:59 AM): they are a bunch of stupid asses   sXeKevyJsXe (1:24:24 AM): clearly just like the adults tell us   sXeKevyJsXe (1:24:47 AM): were jsut a bunch of stupidasses and our friends in highschool wount mean anything when were older   sXeKevyJsXe (1:24:57 AM): they are jsut so self fofillnig   sXeKevyJsXe (1:26:06 AM): fk them all      sXeKevyJsXe (1:28:33 AM): but yeah im glad they moved on and found better people they are just all oh so mature, you knowe living with their parents and stuff   sXeKevyJsXe (1:29:12 AM): man, only if we were as cool as good ole dar and jon (Dar and Jon are friends that we've made since starting at college, he's still in high school)   sXeKevyJsXe (1:29:20 AM): fk us man      It's clear that he has a problem with me making new friends in college, and I would like to talk to him about it. However, if I bring it up it will cause a HUGE fight between him and the person that sent me the conversation, and I don't want that. But I know that if I don't talk to him about it, it'll just keep festering and ruin our friendship.      I have no idea what I can do to solve this, and I really need some help. Thanks so much in advance.

20090219231355AAraGyr	Family & Relationships;Family	Am I being stuck up, major family drama here.?	My cousin and I have always been close until recently. She owes my husband and I a substantial amount of money, $3000. She was paying a little each month, and then I found out the money was coming from my grandmother and not her, so I stopped taking it. She has since "forgotten" she owes me anything, refuses to talk about it or even say I am sorry. Yet, she tells everyone about how her and her husband buy big tv's, games systems, stay at hotels, etc. On top of her owing me money, she lies to get help from the state. Her rent is payed, she gets food stamps, medical card and cash assistance. Her husband works and makes the same amount my husband and I made when we started out, and we payed all our bills on our own. Inspite of getting all this help already, she always needs something. I am always being guilted into picking her up for school, giving her rides, taking her child to and from school. She never has given me a cent in gas money and I have reached the end of my rope. All that started us bickering, and she began saying I was stuck up with me, " clean house, big paychecks and straight A's". Everyone in my family is always saying how hard it is for her, she does not work so I see no reason why her house should be filthy like it is, or she should be failing all her classes, but they still want me to go help her! Now that I am finally pregnant after 2 years of trying I am refusing point blank to have anything to do with her outside of family gathering, I do not need the stress in my life, and trust me she is STRESS. To get back at me she is turning my time into her and her sons time. Everytime I talk about my pregnancy, baby names, plans etc. or get good news she does something to turn it into all about her. Now she has taught her son to go around saying, " Aunt Sammie doesn't love me anymore because she is having her own baby", to which everyone awws and ignores me and tries to force me into babysitting him again. I love him to death, but he is a horrible child, so very misbehaved and abusive to whoever is watching him. He actually tried to punch me in the stomach last week. So with all this, like I said, I am making an effort to be involved with her as little as possible and focusing on my pregnancy and baby. My family is now saying I am stuck up. Am I? Honestly, what would you do in this situation? I love her as my family, but I don't like her...but I hate feeling like a stuck up b***** and having so much pressure from everyone. Any advice, or am I being to emotional?

20090219230408AAF96mB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	This is just a very lame excuse and a misuse of science to indulge infidelity. (?	To say that your bio needs make you sane is like saying animals are saner than people because animals always succumb to their bio needs. So what if your instinct tells you to sleep with other partners? Would you then think it's okay to think of your sister or your mother as very sexy or possible sexual partners? No. Human is capable of being mindful, moral, and ethical. It's your choice to follow that and not succumb to your "supposedly" bio needs show how much of a man you are. BTW, if you are going to argue that sleeping with other partners are in interest of the species, guess what science lover, turn out that having a relationship with one person guarantee more sex (and more great sex) with less effort rather than go out hunting for "candidates" every night. Before using science as an excuse for infidelity and a skeptical view on humanity, think carefully.

20090219233446AAkCopW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there something wrong with me for not wanting to hook up with girls at bars?	I'm currently in college and I go out with my friends a lot to the bars on campus. While I go out just to have a good time (I'm a little on the quiet side, and the alcohol helps me loosen up), all my friends go out with the intention of hooking up with some random girl. I don't see the point in having a one-night stand with a girl and never speaking to her again. I would rather meet someone naturally and hopefully form a lasting relationship if I really liked her. Yet, all my friends tell me to go hook up with these girls.       Am I missing something? Is it wrong for me to not have this objective?      Also, is it possible to form a relationship with somebody you met at a bar after hooking up with them?

We are not in a relationship but we almost act like it (I stay at his house often...he cooks for me...we spend days on end together...we volunteer together...he includes me in his future plans...with an incredible low amount of sexual activity)   I dont feel like he's using me for anything, I just feel like he does certain things because he feels he owes me...which is just as bad...I dont want him to be like "alright I paid you back, see ya"   The amount of time he invests with me in chillin and productivity makes me feel like he's my friend for real (and thats all I'm asking for)...circumstances make me wonder though.    How do I tell the difference???      I dont have any other friends...he's really my only friend except one other female friend. We haven't had sex in a month but our bond is getting stronger and the time we spend together is more and more   Also, we are way past the flirting stage...the smiling and feather touches...We spoon each other almost every night to keep warm now    If I ask him this question he WILL say he's my friend...talk is cheap

We haven't even slept together or anything yet. He started writing me daily all day every day for 2 months and then started playing games and I would have to pick the ball back up and say "where are you I miss you and he would write all day every day again. He is bipolar I know of.       So 1 month goes buy with no calls or emails... and when my friends joked about me being pregnant, his jaw hit the floor and he looked like he lost his best friend. WHY does he care if he doesn't talk to me without me chasing him.      my question is, what is his disappointment a sign of?      thanks :)

20090219232333AAJSsrF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can we still be friends after all of this?	My ex and I were together for about 6 months on and off. He didnt want to be tied down in a relationship so he broke up with me. He insisted that we remain friends because he didnt want to lose me and we hung out a few times since the break up. He would make plans for us to have dinner but then never called and went to go party. I finally had enough and whenever he called or texted after that, I didnt reply. A month later, I saw him and he asked why I was ignoring him and I said I have been really busy. This was the last time I talked to him over a month ago. I think I am pretty much over him (I have been kissing this other guy haha but he is a manwhore so it will not go anywhere) but I have really missed talking to him, as a friend and now I feel that ignoring him was a mistake and that he is still immature but maybe I should be patient with him. He was my first so I dont want him to simply disappear out of my life. I know his schedule and I want to "accidently" bump into him and see if he will talk to me and if he still wants to be friends. Is this a good idea?

Is rest of the year too long to set the separation at ?   Can we get papers drawn up between us (we are in UK)  so not involving childrens services etc?

For girls, does hearing from a friend that he love you and will do anything for you change your feelings toward him?

20090219234635AAFDnIz	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend has self esteem issues, help?	One of my best friends I've known for 9 years has self esteem issues. She's a year older than me but many people have said she's way less mature than I am. Lately I've been feeling sorry for her because she seems to need approval for many things.       She's constantly saying she looks ugly even though I think she's beautiful, she's never satisfied with her looks. Both of us like drawing...even though I'm better because I take drawing very seriously, I always tried to encourage her so she can feel better. However she's always asking me to finish her drawings because she thinks she'll mess up. She smokes a lot of marijuana and is very clingy to her boyfriend...at least that's what it looks like to me.       I don't want to make any assumptions but I think she feels very bad about herself deep down and I want to help her but I don't know how.      Any suggestions?

20090219234621AAsHKyd	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I just can't take it anymore!!! HELP MEEE!!!?	I am seventeen. For three years I have been in love with one of my teachers. At first I thought what you're probably thinking; I was just infatuated because he's so gorgeous! and it's just an older guy thing and he was new. So when he took me for study I chatted to him, and it turned out that he was just so tender-hearted, music oriented like me and a creative man. And bashful. I fell more deeply for him and his beautiful eyes and smile. I can only think of him and how he must be onto me and my blushing face everytime he looks at me. It drives me insane!   I know that I couldn't have him as my boyfriend (and when that happens in my daydreams I marry him fast because I never want to let him go), that he could never want me and it would be wrong because he's eleven years older... But I can't face the fact that I'll have to leave his presence next year for Uni, though he lives in the same city and I just might see him once. I'm allready on the edge and I know that that would push me over. I'd rather stab myself in the throat than leave my friend behind for the rest of my life.   I've tried to get over him so many times! I don't beleive in 'the one' but I couldn't possibly feel any stronger emotion than this. It would kill me all by itself. Please help! What can I DO???!!!   In some ways, he looks a lot like Jared Leto!   I can't distract myself with other boys because I feel so low when I'm with them, because I wish they were him. Also, I hate all my classmates. they're chavs. He's single, it's not illegal where I live because stat is 16, but I also know how it could ruin his life. That's why I'm so anxious over it!!!

20090219232411AAx3kRr	Family & Relationships;Family	At what point should a conservatorship be sought after?	My mother is 78 years old with a moderate case of Alzheimer's disorder.  She clearly is more confused than she used to be.  Now my brother wants to have her sign for a conservatorship for financial and health responsibilities.     She still understands everything she is told about medicines and money and gets upset at being forced to do things now.  Having a conservatorship would allow others to force her to take medicines or spend money to does not want to spend.  If she does something unsafe or is too confused to care for herself, she can still be institutionalized.  I am not sure what the benefit of a conservatorship would be.

20090219233134AAiuYlR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Cheating a month after you get married?	I have a friend that recently got married last year after dating this girl for 10 years.  He finally married her at the age of 36 after a solid 10 year relationship and living together (his first marriage and they have no kids) and he ran into an old fling that he had 4 years previously and there was a solid connection whenever they did first meet and hang out.  He had been with the fling previously 4 years ago but the fling didn't know he was in a relationship at the time.        So...he hasn't seen the fling for 3 years (only talked to her through email)...he gets married...runs into his fling after returning from his honeymoon and starts having an affair because the vibe and connection was still there.  And has been having an affair for 5 months now ever since they ran back into each other.  He says he is in love with this girl and that she gives him the "connection" and love that he was hoping that he could change his wife into.  The wife has no clue and hasn't had a clue about this other girl or the relations that have happened recently or the relations that happened 4 years ago.  I've been asked for advice but am not sure what advice to give.      Any interpretations of this or advice that I could give him?

20090220000238AAoBf81	Family & Relationships;Family	What does a mother do?	I have a 17yr. old boy. He has been very disrespectful to me. He can't deal with being disciplined. He's very disrespectful to me and his step dad, he's failing school with F's, and he doesn't want to do anything around the house. It's like pulling teeth to get him to work around here. I had recently "grounded" him last week because I've had enough of it.   Last night, he tells me that he's wanting to move in with one of his friends and that his friend's mom said it was okay. I was pretty ticked. He didn't mention his living with his dad. We've been through this before going to his dad's when he's mad at me and coming back home when things don't go his way there. So, he thought that he could stay with a friend to get away. For one I'm upset with this friend's mother for telling him that she's okay with it and not consulting with me. Anyway, my son snuck out thru his window. I called his dad and told him what was going on. I went to this friend's house, and no one came to the door. My son, 30 minutes later, called his dad to talk to him. One hour later, his dad's calling me telling me that our son told him that he doesn't want to come back home. I said TOO BAD. So, now I'm ticked off with his dad because my son is getting exactly what he wants, and his dad is okaying everything. My son never goes and visits his dad, hardly. I ask him to, but the only time he wants to and does is when he's grounded. So, I know what this is all about. It still hurts, though. I feel like I've failed as a mom when I've done the best I knew how to raise him. Do I just say, "Go, and don't come back." Do I just wait it out knowing that he's going to get into it with his dad and his wife. Last time he did this he wouldn't talk to me for weeks, but then when him and his dad were arguing he begged to come home.    What do I do?   What would you do?
20090220000743AAzURrn	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Have you ever felt as if it really is a "small world"?	I've just experienced it "soap opera" style. It's amazing how people (good/bad) suddenly come back into your life unexpectedly. It's like a crazy scene fr a soap opera where you're about to meet "someone" your friend's been wanting you to meet...their back is to you and they turn around and it's someone who might have had a major role at one time in your life.      I am now 22 and I had a similar situation happen now...when i turned 18, I had a "debutante" ball. My escort was someone I crushed over time. A few months before that I went thru my first "bad" "puppy love" break up w. a boyfriend and my escort was my first "real" crush after that bad experience. Turns out, my escort was DATING someone while seeing me. tsk tsk. My prom date's girlfriend was having a get together at her place and COINCIDENTALLY she happen to be childhood friends w. "the other girl" and that's how I found out. ANYWAY, at that time, it was the most dramatic thing...we're okay now and get along...but of course, he's not my one of my fav people.       One of my best girl friends started working for this new company months ago. She told our group of girls (4 total) how she was plannin to invite co-workers for her get-together. When she had her party, her co-workers weren't there BUT did tell us about a company party she recently went to. She JUST posted up pictures now and there are shots w. her/husband and her co-worker (her friend) + boyfriend (WHO HAPPENS TO BE MY OLD ESCORT)...it's eerie to me. I'm Asian and we're stereotypically clan-ish and nosy...i'm a private person...as friendly and welcoming as I am, it's weird to me that my world is feeling smaller and I kinda feel threatened. I'm happy my friend has a new friend but it's weird that everyone knows everyone and I feel that my privacy will somehow...i dunno...
20090220000145AAfFyK6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married man tried to get me to have an affair with him........?	Okay please don't judge me, I started talking with him (before he was married, but he was with his GF tho, no excuse I know) I am married also, but hubby left me to move near his family, left me with an ultimatum and I chose to stay here.       well I stopped talking with him but he over heard my friend joking with another friend saying that me and my husband were expecting a baby. They said this married man (who I stopped talking to month ago) looked like he'd seen a ghost, that it almost stopped him in his steps and he starting staring and listening to them to see what they'd say next.      Do you think this means he still had high hopes of getting me into bed? Should I stay away from him, or do you think now that he is married to his GF his intentions are gone? His reaction is what made me wonder? Why would he care if I was preg or not after months...

20090220004621AAxcK0i	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I tell my friend she is making a big mistake?	Well, long story short, another friend and I (lets call her Grace) had a huge fight with three other girls in our group. For the most part, we have made up. I have made up with two of the girls but still fight with one and Grace just doesn't talk much with them, not friends and not fighting.      Now Grace is becoming best-friend like with one of the girls she fought with. It's a BAD idea. She said she never wanted to be friends with this girl ever again. This girl treats Grace really badly everyday but Grace just learns to take it (actually, it's when she stopped taking it that they fought).      My question is, should I leave it alone and let my friend get hurt (which I know will happen) or should I try to talk to her?

What would you do if your husband said these things to you:    We're in a used car lot & he's looking at the heavier duty pickups. He walks over to the heaviest duty truck on the lot & says: "I could haul you...the dog...the camper...."  at this point I cut him off, looked him straight in the eye & said: "Niccceee." Then he gets a surprised look on his face & smiles with embarrassment, realizing what he just said.   Then later that day we need to go to the store to get his birthday dinner fixings for the next day (his birthday). We're in the driveway, just about to get into the pickup & he says: "Should I put the tailgate down for ya?" (like we do for the dogs)   Now, I laughed about this today when I told my friend about it because, well, lets admit, this sounds like an "old couple joke" that you read in a section of the paper. However, it REALLY hurt my feelings.   I asked him what he ment by that & all he said was, "I plead the 5th." Then I told him, "Well, no more fat jokes! That's twice today."    Anyway, I realize that I need to pick my battles & this really isn't a huge thing but I don't think I am "fat" (5'7" 170lbs.)  I feel like this must be how he feels about me or he wouldn't have said it. Right? We we're fighting or arguing or anything like that. Nothing provoked these comments. What do you think?   I just wondered what other's would think if they were in my shoes.

20090220003426AAt2jrJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend jumps a lot when he's sleeping.  It concerns me.  Help?	Okay, so I have a concern about my boyfriend.  We sleep in the same bed sometimes, and when he falls asleep, his body starts jumping a lot.  It is really scary to me, because I don't know what causes it.  He says it's from his ADD medication, but he might only be saying that because he doesn't actually realize he jumps in his sleep.  Does anybody know what could be causing this?   I'm kind of worried that it's caused by childhood trauma, because his dad used to beat him, his brothers, and his mom when he was younger.  He is 18 years old, if that helps.   Thank you for your answers.

20090220000457AAwAUFC	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I stop thinking excessively about everything related to her?	At my workplace there is a girl who works with me in my team. I proposed her 8-9 months back and she said NO. I am fine with this and we are still friends and we work together. We respect each other and we have nothing else in our minds except friendship. But after that, I have developed obsessive thinking about everything related with her. I analyze each and every single thing which happened between us like speaking, writing, working, walking etc. I am sick of thinking too much now. I am not expecting anything with her. And my over-analysing and excessive thinking is killing me. At the moment, every single person at my workplace likes me and I am friends with everyone and I sincerely mean EVERYONE. But I don't want to think excessively and obsessively about anything related to this girl anymore. Can you suggest me what can I do? Thanks. I need serious help to stop thinking. I am already going to a psychiatrist and my thinking has come down a lot than before but I want to improve more.

20090219235159AAAKICx	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How long should I wait to re-marry?	My divorce will be finalized by this Summer. We have been separated for 10 years. He found a way to hold up the divorce proceedings for that long. Almost 2 years ago, I start getting to know this man online and since then we have been in various kinds of contact. We are very taken with each other. Recently, he has been mentioning the "m" word a lot and then quickly getting off the subject, like he is building up to asking the actual question. I am wondering if I should take some time after the divorce is finalized or should I jump into marriage with this man because I have been separated for ten years anyway.
20090219235145AAsrZFx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please Help!! Should I tell him I like him?	One of my best friends asked me out two weeks ago and I said no.   Apparently he asks everyone out so I'm "nothing special." Well I am realizing that I like him too and I'll never find another person that is so much like me. A lot of girls (well, ok all the girls) hate him and think he's a stick in the mud, but I've always been really nice to him, so he is nice to me, he defends me, and I defend him.   So: (1) Should I say anything or wait for him to ?   (2) What do guys like girls to do that they find nice and sweet and/or unique?   (3) Should I just forget him? (He's 9 months younger than me.)

I told her I would be in her wedding if she let us all choose our own dresses but same color. she said "no" so i moved on and kept helping her out, then she wanted my husband to be in the wedding with a different girl instead of me walking down the aisle with him and me being a usher to translate in Spanish for the guests.   I totally said "no", I know me and my "husband" are not married by church (which is a big thing in our family) but only by state and we have a 4month old boy.   I got mad and told her to change the order of the wedding party and find another usher, since that moment she told me " Why are you mad, you shouldn't be. your just scared of him leaving you, you only had your son to tie him down" I mean really hurtful things.    My mom broke us up even though we were on the phone thinking she would take my side, she didn't she told me to suck it up and move on but she said  (adding more wood to the fire) that I was jealous because I was stupid and didn't have a big wedding. but I told her that we were saving up to fly all of our family members in. I got mad and told my sister I was not going to be in her wedding and she told me that I was not invited not even as a guest anymore.   that was 2 months ago...   she called me tonight and told me one of her girls had dropped out and she wanted to know if wanted to be in her wedding?   I don't know what to do?    I am still hurt of what she said about my son and husband...   but she is my sister, my husband says we shouldn't go because she is a punk for talking about me like that... i don't know what to do       SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!

20090220001454AAEEcK0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He feels like he should not apologize... Am I overreacting?	Well my boyfriend and I have been dating for 1.5 yrs now. A few months ago when he was under the impression I would not be coming over, he and a girl were alone in is room watching a movie.(I also know this girl b/c we all used to work together)       He says nothing happened, and she's just a friend. So I asked him to never do it again. If he wants to chill with one of his "buddies" to do it in the living room. So he promised it would not happen.       Well today same exact thing happened. Now I give him the benefit of the doubt when it comes to not fooling around. But do I not have the right to be upset? Mind you it was 1 am AND THE SAME GIRL.       He became upset with me and said he is tired of me always accusing him of cheating...      He feels like he should not apologize, and he did nothing wrong...         Am I overreacting?
20090220002101AAnh83l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I avoid being too close with Male friends?	I have two close male friends at work that I constantly go out with as a group date. We have known each other for almost two yrs now, and even share secrets w/ each other. We became too close that we would share a bed when we are out of town on a group vacation. I find both of them physically attractive, so I don't mind flirting once in a while. I can also sense that they are enjoying it and that they both enjoy my company.   Lately, I realized that I am falling deeply for one of them. I gave him a clue that I like him in a jokingly manner. Now, I am not sure if I should tell him about it because it might change our relationship as friends. By the way, he has a girlfriend that I haven't met. That is also one reason why I though I should stay away from him.

20090220001900AA6qjvb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	About 3 years ago, I went through an emotinal trauma. It led to me nearly loosing my children and my husband.?	I was very depressed, I wanted to end my life, I just wasnt in a good mental state. I would go out in the name of clubbing, but I just got drunk and ended up looking very foolish. I had a one night stand with a guy and as if that wasnt bad enough I brought him back to my marital home. I am feeling very ashamed of my behaviour and I just cannot believe that I did such a thing. I have since gotten alot better and I also have been to church and asked for forgivenes from GOD.       But here is the problem. A few weeks ago I started on a course at my local childrens centre. I met a very nice lady there and we got talking and exchanged numbers etc. She called me a few days later and said that her husband sais that he knew me and MY husband. I didnt think anything of it. I was around her house last week and her husband came home and it was the guy who I had had the one night stand with. Not only does he know my husband but he knows my husbands very good friend too. I am so so worried. I dont know what to do. I am so ashamed of myself. I have not had any other one night stands, it was just that once and I feel so so bad. Should I confess to my husband. W e are so happy now, since I has treatment and have gotten so much better. I would not want to ruin our happy home. What shall I do?

They dated on and off for a year and her and I had our moments as well. On various occasions she asked to be with me. Each time I refused (open endedly) for the time being out of respect for my friend.       Now, however, I have completely fallen in love with her. We both moved away from home, but ended up right next to each other. We see each other, get a few drinks in us...blah blah blah.       Now, 8 months after they broke up she has asked definitively to be with me. What do I do. Have a relationship with the girl I love, or potentially alienate a very good friend and potentially more as a result.   Come on internets, help me solve love problems.

She literary crys to my fiance when she doesen't get to see his daughter enough yet she doesent come to our house to visit expecialy if I am home.  She offered to do all the food for our wedding however when I called her to tell her I got my dress she didnt seem to be very excited. She is always calling or texting my fiance and hes always doing the same.  Yet they never seem to talk when im home.  She will call him and ask him to meet her for lunch but not ask "us"  to meet her for lunch. My fiance tells me "by the way I forgot to tell ya that my sister called a few days ago and wants me to meet her for lunch so after work were meeting up." How does he just forget to tell me something for days?  Everytime "we" ask her to do something with "us" she always has some excuse yet she always wants to spend time with my fiance. On his birthday she got him a card that made him tear up yet he hardley read my card.  Valentines days was another fun day. She got our kids gifts but didnt tell us and was upset to the point of crying that we didnt bring the kids over and yet again she got my fiance a card that made him tear up.  My fiance and I got into a huge fight on Valentines day and changed our plans for the weekend so her feeling wouldent be so hurt.    She is single and I think this is part of the problem.  Every time soemthing goes wrong in her life she calls my fiance. Am I over reacting or is she playing on his feeling, lonley, or just jealous?
20090220004344AAt1iPr	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Don't you wish it was easier to get over certain things?	Don't you wish you didn't have emotions? I know this sounds completely weird and just retarded, but I wish I didn't have certain emotions, like remembering some parts of my past. As hard as I try to forget or not think about some of it, it just comes out of no where, and I'm left feeling sad or pissed off at myself for allowing certain stuff to happen.   I wish I had the mind where I didn't have to care. If my girlfriend were to break up with me, I'd be like, "Okay, whatever." and move on without a care in the world. If I lost someone close to me, I'd just be okay with it, just know they went to a better place without having to cry or be depressed. I don't want that emotion anymore, I don't like crying, I don't like being sad, or hurt. I wish I could just look back at all of my bad past times and not even know what the hell happened. I always find myself thinking about my favorite and also my worst past times, like tonight and I started to cry a little, upset at how I was so stupid to not stop anything and let it all happen to me.    What do you all think? Do you feel the same way or do you just get over it? But I guess with these emotions, they just remind you, you're human.
20090220003954AArJ1f7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he's into me..?	I only met this guy last night but he's a friend of my good friend & goes to the same college. he's also originally from the same hometown area in the country. .    We went out for our friend's 18th and walked around most of the night just talking to each other. He just seemed so easy to talk to & he was so gentleman like all night.. for example he bought me a few drinks and took the money for the cab, got rid of guys that tried hitting on me & put me up for the night (as well as my friend) then drove me home the next morning..

20090220004325AAoXqcJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	It hurts, but i don't know what i should do, any and all advice welcome?	Ok, I am a New York State firefighter and EMT. When i was doing my original EMT class i met this girl, i started falling for her soon after, She had a boyfriend, but i told her how i felt, well they broke up and she said she had fallen for me also, but she started dating i kid i did Firefighter 1(basics of firefighting) with.  While she was dating him she went to my Fire dept. banquet with me. I mentioned to her about how i felt, like i was being "back doored" She said that she didn't want to risk our friendship to try a relationship. Her and him broke up, we became close again and now she is dating another guy. I don't know what to do, i mean, i know i should move on, but i can't, she is on my mind 24-7. I mean it hurts like hell to see her with someone else, but it also hurts not to see her. Lately it feels like she has no time for me though. Anyone have any advice for me?
20090220004532AAyTr40	Family & Relationships;Weddings	My fiance has children and I feel bad about it but I love him?	He is way older than me. He got 3 children, only 1 is his blood, the other 2 are just adopted and step son.  I know he loves me but I think he loves his children more than he loves me. Before he said, he will put me before his children but lastnight, he said that his children and I are equal. His adopted son is a very spoiled one, i hate when he raise his voice to my fiance but my fiance never understand that  the reason why i am upset because i feel like his adopted son doesnt appreciate what he did for him. He saved his life and gave him everything, sent him to a very expensive school and all he needs. Last night, it was his birthday and I had a gift for him and a surprise dinner but he doesnt seem to be happy about it, when i gave him the cake and he made a wish. After the dinner, he talked to his son and he told his son what was his wish, and he said his wish is for his adopted son to be happy. I heard everything. I just feel bad because despite of his sons attitude towards him, he still cares about him and I completely understand but the only thing i feel so bad is i was expecting that he would wish for our relationship to work out. By the way, his son didnt treat me good before. I am also jealous of his ex wife because his ex wife still uses my fiance's lastname even though she's married already. And she still have things in his house and i dont like it. We dont have any photos in his office nor house but i always can see his ex wife's picture in his daughter's room ( the daughter dont live with him anymore). And they still talk and he's really nice to her despite of her rudeness. I just want her things to be out of his house and not use his last name anymore because my fiance and I will be married soon. I always have a thought that he was sweeter to his wife than to me. He kept saying he loves me. We had a talk  and he told me to tell him if I have a bad feeling and i need to talk but let him know not to be defensive and upset and just need him to listen. So I tried and tell him not to be defensive, as soon as i told him I am jealous of his son, then he got very defensive. I couldnt even talk because he was very defensive already. I dont know, he's just very cold for me. I just want him to be sweet to me when I am down and I just want him to comfort me when I need comfort but he's doing the opposite. When I am crying he would not comfort me. Is he the one for me? Do i have to continue our relationship? But I love him and he loves me. 99% we are very inlove and very happy but i have a problem about his children and past. But i dont do anything to them. I am just jealous but I am very good to them. Please help me what to do..By the way, I have no children yet but my fiance and I are planning to have some as soon as we get married but should I marry him?
20090220004559AAvWXyb	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I write to him in prison?	After my step dad died I lost contact with all of my step family. I grew up with them...I'm 25 now and have not spoken with them in almost 10 years! I recently found out my step cousin, who is my age was put in jail 4 years ago. Should I write to him? His release date is in 2016.  He was charged with child molestation ( he masturbated in the presence of his little sister) and was released. He violated his probation by going to the park with a neighbor...I believe that he didn't know he was not supposed to be at the park. He was severely abused as a young man and molested by his own grandfather. He has a child like mind, and I can't see him doing this? I want to write to him and get the truth. I wonder if his step mom didn't coach the little girl into saying this just to get him out of her life.  She was crazy...one of the reasons I lost touch with her. Would it be stupid of me to write him now? I want to know what happened, and maybe see if I can help...I just can't believe it happened that way. I know those people and the mom is crazy.  If he admits to doing it I can let it go... but I feel guilty that he may be in there and I"m just sitting back not doing anything. I haven't seen him since like 2002 at a funeral...but we were close growing up. any advice. thanks!  sorry about all the babble.
20090220004621AAQa1TA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A Question for You Guys... (Or Girls if You Know the Answer.)?	Okay so here's a question for all you guys of the world.   Do guys honestly like big boobs? Or is there point when a girls boobs are too big?      This is honestly a question that bothers me..   You see I'm 16 almost 17 and I'm already a DD,,   No I'm not fat, and I'm not a stick figure either..   Im just normal sized..      Now I know guys like breasts because whenever I talk to them their eyes always seem to wander. And let me tell you all, girls do not find this flattering. And I don't know about other girls but I myself find it embarrassing and disrespectful.   And for the life of me I can't figure out your fascination.      Anyway as I said before this really bothers me, so much that sometimes I feel like I should get a breast reduction, so that maybe when I talk to a man he will be looking at my face instead of my chest the whole time..   But I hear it can be dangerous..      I don't know..   I guess I'm just self conscious..      So if anyone could please shine some light on this situation it  would be greatly appreciated.    All answers are welcome!

Ok, This guy and I had been seeing each other off and on for about 2 years, but not so much as I am away at college hours away.. He tried to get me to me his girlfriend for 4 months straight, and I screwed up my being a ***** about it. Well, 4 months of nothing and telling me he'll do anything to be with me, then 2 week after him saying he'd do anything he has a girlfriend. Now that really made me angry because I really think we are supposed to be together. I finally came clean about how i felt, but he says that he wishes i was that way before, and now he doesnt want to hurt her. BUT he continues to text me, and he even comes to see me, but "nobody can know".. I've only seen him 3 times since they started dating and I haven't even kissed him. But what do i do? I want him to be with me, but I'm not trying to get what i want the wrong way. Any advice?
20070423092550AAfk08e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my girlfriend lying to me or just trying to hide something?	Donna and I were together for four years.  On our first date she told me an elaborate story about being in the CIA and FBI. It was full of detail, but it didn't quite make sense. Once we started dating seriously, the CIA business still came up, but not as often. After a couple of months I confronted her about his story and gave her full opportunity to confess about his big lie. We ended up arguing and broke up.(temporarily)   Well, we got back together when she apologized and told me all the lying was to impress me. But it didn't stop there. Donna was full of stories that seemed too wild to be true. All kinds of crazy stories about race car driving, the military, espionage, knowing the president personally, and so on. Now, during the time we were together I became very close with her friends and was able to occasionally ask about the wild stories/lies that I had been told. Most just laughed it off. So I called the president, and he said he didnt know Donna. So I think she is lying.

20061021154343AASwpWk	Family & Relationships;Weddings	If you had the money and the opportunity to have the wedding of your dream, how will you have it done?	Wives and brides to be, let's share your dream wedding ideas. It's yours and you get to at least get it out of your chest. Mine was to have a wedding on the beach with outdoor tent and tequila. No shoes and overloaded jewelry needed but fancy sunglasses and pretty bikini beneath the dress is recommended. It's I, the groom, the priest, the guests and the sun. After ceremony and during reception, we will take off swimming or playing beach volley. Of course my wedding was a lot more complicated, but the beach wedding was all I wanted and still dream of.

Bueno el caso que es que tratamos de intentarlo nuevamente, pero me di cuenta que estaba perdiendo mi tiempo con el, era un mentiroso nada mas y gracias a mis amigas y a mis amigos y amigas del Yahoo respuesta me di cuenta de la realidad de las cosas.

20070320154743AAqhXxE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i think, guys??	Alright...here goes....   When i was 16 yrs old, you could say that i found my first-love.  We were inseparable, would do anything for each other, we were each other's first true-love.  Since i grew up in a very strict household, my parents were against our relationship, esp.since i was so young.  But we still stayed together, without either of our parents knowing for another 3-4 yrs.  He had to break it off with me bcuz i had a friend who kept telling me not to trust him and from time-to-time, i would break upwith him and then get back together, break-up, get back together, etc...   I don't blame him for breaking it off, what was he supposed to do. Now, 7 yrs later, i see him in a dream, decide to try to contact him via one of those reunion sites, and to my surprise, he responded!  We both r very happy to be in contact with each other again, but looks like neither one of us want to make the 1st move.  I know he still has feelings 4 me, but he won't budge.  Does he want a relationship?

20061113142948AAZ12mg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help!!..Picking up girl situations..without being rude?	I need some girls advice here.  I'm a good looking guy but shy and  useless with girls unless drunk.   However In my job as a porter I meet lots of girls, some staying at hotel others just passing by on street..anyway I get the feeling some are attracted to me (looks, body langauge, etc).  anyway I'm useless at asking girls out.  For example, I'm chatting to a hot girl today who's passing by and asks for directions, we chat for a bit and I can sense she's attracted to me, though due to the fact we're two strangers only just briefly talking to each other, I'd feel an idiot, rude and not sure if it would sound weird to ask for her phone number or something.  Many similar situations crop up..what would you suggest.  Would I just be wasting my time and look a fool trying to get a girl in these situations or how should I go about it??  Please help!!

20070202083156AAScmmk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I wanna be more than friends but how?	Well I've been with a very good friend online who I met with from myspace.  She said on myspace that she was looking for a relationship (and friends of course).  We've been talking a lot almost everyday for nearly a month and we laugh, talk a lot, tease each other and I want to be more than friends.  I've given her the hint to be more than just friends but she wanted to be friends still.  We been talking for about a month, what's taking her so long?  She does have trust issues because she's been married before and her husband used to hit her a lot and had a lot of broken hearts.  Well I've had a lot of broken hearts too but that doesn't stop me from hoping to be more than friends with someone.  How do I become more than friends with her when she said she wanted to be friends first after a month?  How long are we supposed to be friends before we become more? I'm getting a little tired of waiting.

Sometimes, i caught her looking at me during classes, camps and such. However, i looked right away after i saw her since i'm the kind of a 'shy' person.      She also told me that she liked me before when we were in primary school. And i did noticed that when she liked me. She did mentioned that she liked nobody now (she's a shy person too).      So could she had lied to me that she liked no one? Or she does not have a crush on me anymore?

20070418001728AA9Yp5n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?	I want to know if my best friend likes me more than a friend.    We hang out every weekend, all weekend long. He calls me at least twice a day, he holds doors for me (and no one else) He has written songs for me, He acts very nervous when we are alone together. He sits with me where ever we go, walks next to me. He is always worried about me. He hangs on to my every word, he is always trying to make me laugh. If we are leaving from somewhere, he waits for me to get my coat on and grab my purse, even when everyone else has left. Is this just him being a really good friend, or does he have feelings for me?    Thanks

My friend and i like the same girl (we'll call her sarah). we're both in high school and neither of us have ever had a gf. he said that he liked her when i was going after another girl. the other girl turned me down and when i got back to school sarah was in my class. i've been trying not to fall for her but i can't help it. she's pretty, smart, and mature which is a rarity for high school girls & she is the type of girl i want. i've been helping my friend ask her out but i just realized that i can't keep myself from liking her. i'm in a much better position than my friend to ask her out. i talk to her everyday and have her # while he only sees her once a week. my friend and i have been friends w/ her for a year.      The thing is that he will b pissed if i ask her out. i've known my friend for a LONG time and i don't want to lose friends but at the same time i want to date the girl that i like. i don't want to get into a situation where i have to choose between them. what should i do?
20070606083417AAE7pzf	Family & Relationships;Friends	Could he regret ending things with me?	I was dating this guy not exclusively for 3 months. He goes to Ireland for 2 weeks, sees me 2 times at work before he breaks up with me 4 days after he goes home and says "its weird now bc he was gone so long" which to me was a bad reason. Now I ignore him at work becasue I am a little hurt and now he seems down and apparently when I walk by and say nothing he watches me and then kinda puts his head down like hes sad. I mean, does he regret it now? I think he ended things bc he feels guilty about what happened in Ireland but I never assumed we were exclusive so it shouldnt matter. I still like him and want him back and possibly exclusively...what should I do?   I try not to look upset bc I dont want him to see I care that much.

20070711164150AAOXnpu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls: Do you like them 'big' or 'average'?	I have seen various opinions here. A lot of girls have said that they dont like them big and prefer average because there is less pain that way. However, I rank on the big side and have never ever had a girl complain about the size. While there was some pain, it never seemed to make them want something smaller. Im wondering what you all think.      Oh and go ahead and say "liar" and what not. I dont really care if you dont believe me, Im just curious about your opinion.

Les cuento, si un tipo conoce a dos chicas, una que es extrovertida, se arregla mucho, se pinta (sabe hacerlo para que negarlo) pero no es muy agraciada físicamente que digamos, pero actúa como si fuera mas guapa de lo que es (osea le falta ubicaina). Por otro lado hay una chica físicamente mejor que la anterior pero es medio tímida y actúa como si fuera peor de lo que es. ?por quien creen que se decide el tipo???  Yo diría que muchos se inclinan por la primera.

Lei dopo 7 anni non sa più se mi ama, abbastanza all'improvviso. lascia tutti a bocca aperta perchè la nostra storia è stata sempre bellissima, indicata da tutti come ideale, andiamo daccordissimo. E allora? Lei dice che vuoleio sia l'uomo della sua vita, non capisce cosa le succede, non può stare senza di me, ma vuole allontanarsi per capire..... tutti, lei compresa, dicono che un altro non esiste.   Io l'ho spronata ad allontanarsi perchè come lei correttamente dice è inutile trascinare la situazione se lei non capisce il problema, istintivo perchè per quanto tutti noi ci sforziamo da ragionare c'è ben poco!   Forse il tempo? Cosa ne pensate?

20071106124927AAb0kuS	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why dont I have a close group of friends?	I just don't get it... I'm a nice guy and I'm fun to hang out with... The few friends I have who goto diffrent schools all like me, but in my school I never had those friends that I can call for my problems or call to hang out with on the weekend ( maybe like 1, who moved away for college)  i even feel depressed about it sometimes .. I'm not mean to people or antisocial.   I joke around to show I have a sense of humor and spark conversation.. I mean I don't care about being popular but it sucks going to school everyday and having to eat lunch in the library.  I have soo many aquaintances who i can chat with in class and stuff, but no "real" friends. I mean I'm not ugly, I'm not a nerd, and I'm not weird.. I'm a likeable guy and maybe people assume i already have friends. I'm very nice to ppl but it seems like they all go out on the weekends and I'm home on facebook... I know I have faults and I know I'm not gonna be Mr. Popular but I want to have a close group of people to be around.

20070517130023AAn5iXo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Sounding desperate - what's wrong with that?	People have often told me that I come across as sounding desperate (for a girlfriend); and often, they say act as if it’s a bad thing. I don’t deliberately try to sound desperate, and I think there are other interpretations. But whatever.      My question is this: What’s wrong with that?      I don’t understand. If there was a girl who was desperate for a boyfriend, that wouldn’t bother me; that wouldn’t cause me to become disinterested; that wouldn’t be a turn-off. She’s desperate – so what? so what? If anything, that gives me assurance that she’ll easily accept a dating invitation, which is actually a good thing in my opinion.      But maybe there’s something that I’m not getting.      Enlighten me, please.

I went out on a first date and I liked the guy and he seemed to like me too, or at least I thought he did.  We really enjoyed each other's company, went to the market and cooked dinner together at his place. He's a very nice and laid back kind of guy.  We went as far as kissing and nothing more.  He called me once afterwards, but after that haven't heard from him since.  It has been about 4 days.  Dose this means he's not interested?  Should I email him and offer to remain friends?    I really would like to continue getting to know him and even just to stay friends but how would I approach him without sounding desperate or needy?  Please give me some good advice and please be nice...I'd appreciate it.  Thank you.

20070610201223AAPgi1o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it possible to pay a stripper to have sex with you?	Is it possible to pay a stripper you like to have sex with you? I went to a strip club a few days ago, a stripper asked me if I want to have a private dance and I took the offer, she had a very good and sexy body, good looking too. The private dance was kinda pricey, $75 bucks for three songs. Now I am wondering if I come back to that strip club, would she had sex with me if I pay her? Is $500 good enough? Will she tell the bouncer and kick me out? If you ever had sex with a stripper, had this kind of experience, or your friend is a stripper, don't be stingy to share.

20070617040524AAOL5hy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ready for marriage?	So my boyfriend and i have been dating for about 6 mos, and have been friends for about 8 mos. we are both in the military stationed overseas, far from our friends and family back in the states. i guess the question is should we get married? we've been talking about it a lot lately. we are both strong christians, and agree on almost anything, except homosexuals which kind of bothers me, because my brother is openly gay. but other than that our beliefs match. we also have simular goals in life. however we are both young (i'm 19, and he's 21...) We know marriage is a lot of work, and i guess i just want some advice from people who are married, or have been. i work in a mental health clinic and i see a lot of broken famlies, and marriages that didnt work. i dont want to rush into anything but our tours are going to be up soon, and if we dont get married he is goin back to the states, and i'm staying overseas for 3 more yrs. my heart is telling me go for it...but my head is scared.

There was this boy named Travis that i liked, so my best friend Rachel asked him out for me and he said that he'll think about it, so every day my stomach would hurt whenever i saw him because i really liked him. He finally gave me an answer: no because he said it wasn't the right time. Anyway i got soo mad and confused  because people kept on telling me that he said no completely and other things. So i said all these mean things about him such as i wished that he got ran over by a car and that someone would hit him with a baseball bat. We were mortal enemies for like a month and then i apologized and we became friends. On the last day of school i confessed to Rachel that i still had feelings for him and that i wanted to kiss him because his birthday was coming up and he's never had his first kiss. to make a long story short, i didn't get to kiss him but he gave me his phone number but he won't answer so he doesn't know that i still like him. what should i do???

20070624220842AAtkE8E	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me or what?	I'm still in High School, & I'm still a bit bluggh about it. So the situation is that there have been signs he has, like the eye contact, or nervousness. But that mostly last year, and some of this year. Now when he sees me, it's like he's ignoring me. But this year, some signs are that he tries to around me. We don't even have a real conversation anymore in person, and it's rare on aim or myspace. But a huge factor is that he's really shy.  Not around other girls, but me YEAH! & he can totally tell I like him. He asked me what I wanted for a gift for my birthday, and he's not like that to other girls that are OUR friends. What does that mean? I'm confused... wanna help?

Well I was bored at work and I was looking on his MYSPACE and he's got a girlfriend that he is apparently in love with from back home. I am pissed and I am heartbroken. I am so mad at him and I want some type of clarity. I really don't know what to do from here.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 3 months, and up til about the last 3 weeks, things have been great. But in the last few weeks, we BARELY talk at all. It's like we never have time. whenever I'm not busy he is. It's driving me up a wall because whenever I need someone to talk to, he's not there. What do I do? I still love him but this whole situation is the reason I broke up with my last ex. He knows this also. By the way we're 17 (me) and 16 (him).... Someone help before I make a decision i'll regret. :((

20070727014105AA7Ae9i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need your advice..i am lost.?	Besides cheating on me which i forgave him. Way overboard- I found out the  he is talking to another man online m2m chat so i was wondering if he is gay but he said he never been with a man before that he was just playing around.  So, i asked him if he posted his pictures PR and non PR.  He said no.  But he lied i found out that he posted his pictures nude and non-nude picture so i was really upset.  So, now we are not talking at all, just ignoring each other.  So, i do feel guilty for doing that finding out stuff to ruin relationship but i just needed some answers, if he just told me the truth in the first place then i wouldn't go around and look for the whole truth.  What should i do and how do i resolve this..i do love this person and we do have kids togther.  Now, he said he could not trust me again, no more relationship and not looking back again.  I am feeling empty now.  Still thinking about it--feeling guilty.

He'll just keep staring for a really long time and he doesn't even care if I see him doing it. He also told me one night that I looked pretty. But, hes somewhat of a player but he doesnt seem to flirt as much with other girls. So, do you think he likes me? And he always asks me to hug him.

20070820185123AAKG2pc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She won't say "I love you"...?	My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 4 months now. I have fallen head over heels for this woman. The problem is that I am quite not sure how she feels about me. I told her that i love her after 3 months of dating her, which is kinda quick but i just had to tell her, i couldnt hold it inside anymore. She didn't say it back the first time that i said it... she grabbed me, kissed me deeply and held me. I have said it a lot since then and shes said it back to me about only 2 or 3 times. Everytime I say it all she does is look deeply into my eyes and kiss me. We spend a lot of time together and i make sure she knows how i feel about her. I just want opinions on this? I mean, am i rushing it? or am i being paranoid by thinking that just because she hasnt said it much means that she doesnt? She noticed one time that I got a little upset that she didnt say it back to me and she told me that just because she doesnt say it, doesnt mean that she does not love me.

Ok amigos esta es mi historia he salido con muchos chicos en mi vida, cada una en su debido momento, pero me he dado cuenta que ninguno logro enamorarse de mi, he tratado hasta lo posible de ser carinosa, atenta y muy cumplidora con ellos, pero nada funciona a veces me siento tan frustrada de no poder sostener una relacion formal, me han dicho que cambie por que asi siempre me enganaran, pero no puedo esa es mi esencia asi naci, muchas veces me he dicho olvidalo no lo encontraras pero se presenta otra persona en mi vida  y creo que Dios me esta dando la oportunidad de amar de nuevo, pero vuelve a pasar que es lo que pasa? algun carma del pasado o que? ojala me ayudan a decifrar esto.

20070905202523AA1vKws	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should we just work at it?	How do I break up with him.Should I be afraid?What should I do about this?I tried to break up again just now!?   I met a man online in June of this year.We started out fine...but slowly..things have changed.Alot of it is my fault.I have told him four times since June that we are not good for one another.Then he starts saying things like " But we love each other!" "I love you!" "You love me, lets work this out!" Then I start to feel bad and sad...and so..I stay.I noticed that he has a BAAAD temper.He got angry a few weeks ago and punched the wall.    We got into an argument at a resturaunt and he said to me " You are acting like such a ****!" ) :   Last week I decided to just ignore his calls.I thought that he would just give up and leave me alone.I was hoping that maybe he would just meet a really BEAUTIFUL woman and forget about me. I did not answer his calls for three days.He ended up Googleing my street address and got directions.He was at my door ringing the doorbell. He was saying " Sweetie where have you been I have been so worried. I thoughtr something happened to you!" I feel sooo bad.
20070906203506AAFdVKx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just a friend or needs more time to see who I am.?	So a friend of mine set me up with a friend of hers. We got along really well and had a lot in common. In other words we clicked. She told the girl who set us up that I was "awesome", but didn't have feelings for me. She also said she really wanted to hang out again too though. So should I take this as "we only met once so why would she have feelings for me?" or does she only want to be friends? Keep in mind we only met once.

20070909131735AAUmmkW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know what to do. I think i'm in love.?	Ok, i'm a 14, almost 15, year old boy, and i went to my friend Chelseys sweet 16 last night. I met this girl there named Ashley who i think looks beautiful. I was thinking alot that night just about life so i wasn't dancing with everyone. Then, ashley kept comming over and asking me to dance about 3 times. Each time i would get up and dance with her and then go sit back down and think again. As i'm thinking, i kept noticing her glaring at me from the dance floor, but i don't know if it was because she liked me or if she felt pity for me. I love her personality as well as the way she looks so now i start thinking about her. I wanted to get to know her more, but unfortunately i'm shy. I was trying to talk myself into talking to her if she was alone, but she never was. I don't think i'll ever get to see her again either, and her face is fading from my mind, but i don't want it to. I never had a girlfriend before so i'm new to this. I really have no idea what to do. Please help me.

20070921165353AAP6iya	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Pretty people and sex.?	I cannot seem to have peace with the fact that  pretty people (male and female) are.. pretty. Handsome guys, pretty girls and that they do get lots of sex easily and get lots of love, and build lots of confidence and generally their lives are so much easier. I cannot get over it. I get mad when I think about it and hit the table flat with my fists to discharge anger and resent (is that the right english word? or is it contempt?)      I dont know what to do. I always fee like this, I do alot of soulsearching and most of the time when some thought that comes to my mind and when I look at my life it bothers me,    then I get mad, mad, mad.      When I see handsome guys on television having so much confidence and enjoying themselves and being so happy.   Ofcourse they are, they prolly got called handsome and got attention and girls all their lifes. They dont know what its like to be left outside.. They got all the attention, sex, love, women, everything. Ofcourse they are confident. And saddly..

I knew him for year before that, but right now he seems like a different person. His college program is pretty tough and school is his life basically. He always seems to be irritated/worried/angry about smg or nothing in particular, everything. He tells me it's because of the stress he takes just to stay in his program. So everyime I see him, I feel like seeing him at his worst. I totally get that school is challenging, I'm myself in that situation. What kinda bugs me is that he told me once if school was his only problem he'd be the happiest guy alive...he keeps saying he can't be happy, i was trying understand what it is exactly that makes him so unhappy, but he won't tell....right now his facebook status says he hates everything around him!! I just don't understand where's all this anger coming from. I feel like I can't really help.

20071012195640AAZnjEC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How long should I wait for my boyfriend to say those three little words?	I've been dating my boyfriend for 18 months now.  He recently moved in with me about two months ago and everything seems to be going well except for one thing.  He has yet to say, "I love you."   Everywhere we go, he makes it a point to introduce me as his girlfriend.  He says that everyone tells him how lucky he is and how attractive I am.  I've met his family numerous times and have been invited to all of the family functions.  (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Father’s Day, etc)  I recently had a birthday party for him and at my house and his entire extend family was there.  He wouldn’t tell me who made the comment but he said that someone told him, “Man, she must really like you if she allowed your entire family in her house.” His mom has invited me out on occasions to "girl’s night only dinner".  I know that he is the one for me and I've been dying to tell him  much I love him but I've always been told that I need to wait until the guy says it first.   But how much longer should I wait?

20071021171355AAzjMf6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Where's the best place to go out on your own in Pittsburgh to meet singles?	So, this is my situation (also see the question this question links to):  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       I've managed to finally go on a trio of dates, although they ended with the girl deciding to "just be friends," which may be because we'd known each other for so long.  I didn't even achieve a first kiss.  My friends have been flaking out on me lately, so I'm gonna have to go out on my own for a bit.  I'm starting to feel like I might finally be able to meet someone, but in this clique-obsessed and fratboy jerk-filled town, I'm not sure where to go.  So, where should a nice, good-looking, but fairly offbeat guy go to meet pretty, single 20-something women in this godforsaken town if he's on his own?  Any ideas?  ANY?  Please?  I'm getting desperate here.

Me and this guy like each other. but he has an over obsessive girlfriend, he doesn't know if he wants to break up with her or not..   the reason why he's iffy with going out with me is because i go to a different school. and during the week when we don't see each other the spark really isn't there. we don't flirt that much. but when we see each other basically every weekend we are really flirty, even on the phone during the weekend we are still flirty.   my heart pounds whenever i get texts from him and whenever he gets online.    what should i do?      p.s. please don't say "stop flirting with another girls boyfriend" becuase i've liked this kid for a really long time, and him and his girlfriend just recently started going out.

20090203114342AAPa6QP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you guys think is he a cheater 10pts for the best answer?	Hi everyone k this is my story i was with my ex for about 2 years and a half everything was perfectly fine just like they say too good to be true in the beginning.   K but a couple months ago he has been acting cold and rude with me & i found him a couple things that really made me think he did cheat on me.   The first thing i found was a pic of another girl in his cell phone that he texed to his cousin when i confronted him he said it was his roomates   then i found him a different girl pic at his job when i confronted him he said a guy asked him to take her a pic to draw her cause my ex is a drawer   his roomate g/f told me he has bring other girls to his home but she is one of those haters, that doesnt like to see other couples happy, just cause she is unhappy   i heard 2 girls voicemails on his phone because he has given me his password one girl said *Yeah you wanna come over*   other girl said *HI baby im gonna come throw rocks outside your home assho13*   one day i was calling him private from my phone to see what he would do and he lied to me because i was calling him n he walked out of the room and when he came back in said oh my cousin he couldnt hear me.   Those are the suspicious signs we just broke up friday cause i fell asleep n didnt hear my phone so he though i was doing something bad and no i was not, and everytime i would ask him was he cheating he would swear to his dead father no he didnt' but i didn't believe him therefore im actually happy now  he did brake up with me.   But just curious what do you guys think is he a cheater that keeps it on the down low.

20080619114947AAOFI02	Family & Relationships;Family	Family Issues?	My mother in law, me and my sister in law take classes together on weekends. This weekend, my sister in law is unable to go so my mother in law offered to drive us there. There's nothing wrong with that, but when we go there, we usually take the highway and it takes up 45 minutes but my mother in law doesn't know how to drive on the highway, so she wants to take the side streets and it'll take us 1.5 hours to get to class! I'm not comfortable with that, it'll be such a LONG day. It's almost as if we're driving across the border to New York (we live in Toronto.) I told my husband that I don't want to go that day because it'll be so tiring, plus, I have to meet some of my girlfriends for lunch that afternoon so I don't know if I'll reach home in time for the lunch. I don't understand why my MIL is being so stubborn, it wouldn't kill her to miss one class. I told my husband how I feel, but it's like neither of them cares about how I feel about the situation. What to do?
20090203114038AAD9a3A	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you love and hate someone at the same time?	I love my husband but sometimes I absolutely hate him for things he did to me in the past that were wrong.  I also don't really trust him that much.  He used to be a porn addict and had told me once that he thought about leaving me.  I loved that man too death and he goes and does this to me.  Don't get me wrong, I hate feeling like this, but I feel like I can't help it.  Yes, he is nice to me and he is a good father to our children, but I feel like any day he could let me down again.  I have done everything he has wanted me to do but still I feel like he is planning to leave us one day and that's what makes me not like him very much anymore.  Has anyone ever had this problem?  I am not saying he has to be perfect or that I am saying I am.  I am just saying that I wish he would consider sometimes how I would feel about things before he jumps into them.
20081006071438AAYpVu6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I kick my ex-wife out of my apartment?	I divorced my wife a few months ago because she had been coming home very late after I warned her not to continue doing so.  By late I mean after 2 AM about once a week.      We've stayed together because she wants to and I still enjoyed being with her, but things have become intolerable for me.  Last Saturday night she stayed out all night with another man.  I want to separate now.      Our lease is up in 5 days.  She has two children that live with her.  They are from her previous marriage.  We have no children and she is not expecting.      Is it fair for me to tell her now (I told her last night) that she can't live with me in the new apartment and she must find her own place.  Yes, we have still been sleeping in the same bed (when she comes home) and no she does not pay rent and she is not on the lease.      I think she made her bed and must now lie in it.  What do you think?

20090203114848AAOJEqr	Family & Relationships;Friends	I am being put in an awkward situation by my friend, what do I do?	My co-worker Amanda is having a small birthday party.  Going is her best friend, Ariel.  But also going is her most hated person in the world, Marge, who also happens to be my ex..  I actually work in the same company as Marge, but different departments.  I did the breakup, but she made it very messy.      It took Marge and us 6 months before we even acknowledged each other again.  But now everything is good.  We joke around like we use to, but none of us wants a relationship again.  Anyways, Ariel asked if she could come with me to the party.  I said fine, she also asked that I limit how much I talk to Marge, and to please not flirt with her.  Ariel doesn't have feelings for me, but thinks that Marge is going to take me from her as a friend.        Ariel is a better friend to me than Marge, but at the same time, I don't want to snub Marge because as friends, we're doing really well now.  What should I do?

20090203113416AAOxvrJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I break up with her?	I recently began dating a girl from home - we're both in college now. We've only been going out for like a month, but we both have felt like we should have been going out for much longer than that, and I think the feelings between us are genuinely love.      However, I just got into a huge fight with her last night over the distance issue. She goes to a community college at home, while I go to a private college a thousand miles away. She's been hinting that I should transfer to be closer to her, but finally asked me to transfer straight out last night. I really don't want to, so I said no, and it just went downhill from there. She obviously feels like I don't value the relationship, but I told her no reason at all could possibly make me transfer, even her.      I don't know what to do about this. I almost feel like if she's gonna be like this, then I don't want to be with her. I'm seriously considering breaking up with her over this. She clearly doesn't respect my decision not to transfer, and I honestly don't think she can handle being without me. She spends her nights at home while I'm gone drinking herself to sleep. She's also being a burden on my social life here - she expects me to talk to her almost constantly, to the point where it is difficult to do anything else with my friends here at college. I think the problem is that she's madly in love with me, but I'm don't feel as strongly about her, and she seems to be a really clingy person, to the point where she literally needs to have someone else to cling to in order to get by, and she's picked me, but I'm not actually there so she's breaking down.      What do you think I should do?      One thing that makes breaking up with her a bit more awkward is that in the wake of the fight, I stopped answering her calls for a while, and she got pissed and ended up telling my parents that we were going out, which they didn't know yet. So now if I break up with her it'll be like they found out, and then we broke up right after. And she just added my brother, who she's never met, as a friend on facebook, just to compound the difficulty of breaking up with her if I decided to.

I fell pregnant. But before I knew about the baby, I ended the relationship and it looked like we were never going to be together again. So I had an abortion ( please no nasty comments).       Anyway, 2 years later, we meet up again, and he still loved me.. and I realized that I still loved him... so we got married and we have 2 sons... and I love them all but I feel guilty.       Should I tell my husband what I did??? I don't think he would forgive me.  I told him that I had a miscarriage because I had a bit of complications and because of my blood group and his. And we both cried about it, because he was sorry he wasn't there for me.       I am so confused... I look at my sons and wonder what the hell I was thinking, how could I have been so cruel..I was scared but I was also an adult, I should never had let my sister's tell me what to do!

20090203115806AA5Y0gf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If your ex offers you...?	a lump-sum payment of 100 000$ for child support, to cover the next 16-18 years of your child's life...   Would you do it?   My ex asked me if I'd accept something like that... Currently I get about...200$ per month in child support from him...      (I'm well aware he'd never have 100k to give me in a lump sum payment, but still, the question made me curious on what others would do or say).      I told him...if he had the means to give me that much as a lump sum, it would mean he would make more then enough to actually give a decent child support... since I've supported my son alone since birth, my ex-husband even stole money I had put away for our child's daycare (was the only one working, he was sitting on his butt all day, complaining he didn't have a job, and we were separated and not living together)..      So, if you' d receive an offer like that, would you accept?

But then I asked him who he likes (another guy friend of ours was in the room when all this took place) and he said no one at this time.. and then he asked me and I said the same thing cause i felt like i just got rejected... and then later that same night he said he doesn't want to date anyone because relationships are 'complicated.' So does he like me and not want to date me or does he not like me at all? He teases and flirts with me constantly... IDK WHAT TO DO!! Move on?

20090203114645AAOVxQ5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I know if a girl finds her future with me and is serious, since she might hardly exprress it ?	A girl might not say what she has in her mind, and just a smile or a talk or so doesn't mean, by women standard, any motive for a relationship esp a serious one. And if a man doesn't know he will not make the next move which is why a serious girl might get preoccupied and disappointed. How to ensure right couples get together sooner?

20090203113655AA0S8uF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think it's wrong to go against your morals and values if it could possibly save your marriage?	I'm at my wits end with my marriage. I moved out in September, but came back in December. I think he's an alcoholic. He says he likes to have fun and I'm 'lame'. I think he maybe cheated while I was gone, but he says "if you think that, get a divorce". He puts his family before me and the kids. I have tried begging, pleading, counselling, etc and nothing seems to get through. I finally broke down last night and told him that he "wins" so to speak and that I see he tried to live different, but it made him angry at me and withdrawn. In turn, even with the drinking cut down and the bar stops less frequent, the marriage is still awful. The funny part is that he says that he's really happy. I'm miserable. So, I told him last night that I would let go of what I think is right and wrong and try to be more like him and his family. He seems thrilled, but I am sick to death about it. I literally got myself so worked up last night that I vomited. I can't mix my current life with this bar trash/drinking/put myself ahead of the kids deal. I feel like I'm giving up who I am proud to be to save our marriage. I can't hang out with my friends and talk to them about my life like this or they will think I'm crazy. I know that marriage is important. Is this just ridiculous to try to be a better marriage partner like this? I told him that I wouldn't be bothered if he goes to the bar. I told him to just do his own thing and I'll do mine. I let him know that I will put the kids into daycare/school and go to work full time. I feel like I asked him to change for me and he tried, but failed. Isn't it only fair if I do the same for him? I think the main reason this is so hard for me is because I was raised different than this and I would be embarrassed to have friends or family find out that I'm now a bar person. I can't imagine being thought of as someone who dumps my kids off and skips off to work. This is embarssing, but I know that people do this everyday. Do you think that this is the right thing to do even though right now it is uncomfortable and weird or should I just count this as a failed marriage and be alone?   2 seconds ago - 3 days

20090203114047AA85VC6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Scared if thing don't work out..?	Well over a month ago my wife told me our marriage was is trouble and she was not sure what was going on ,we talked and decided to work on it .Allot was neglect on my part being as for awhile I have been under treatment for depression and back problems. Well as going through it  not being there for her.  Well I know things won't fix over night and could take time ,we talk a little more but she just seems distant .  We have been together 18 yrs with 2 children 13&16.  I love my wife and don't want to lose her.    Now after reading some posts here I start to worry if things don't work out and we separate, what will I do?  Im 38 yrs old and  sold my lawn company in 2004 do to back injury and she has supported me since , as far back as I can remember I have done the house husband thing with kids and all so she could further her carrier and thats the way she wanted it ....it worked out for us!!  Sorry, thing is im worried what would i do I have a 9th grade education and havent worked since 2004 and still having medical problems ,if she decides she wants to go her own way ,I have no family nothing what would I do.She has done everthing for us for the past 5 yrs.  Thanks to all..

20081010024525AAWB7d1	Family & Relationships;Family	Dealing with addicted parents?	I would have to say most nights, if not all, my parents smoke a certain drug and get high off of it. They've done it for as long as I can remember, and until now I have been able to tolerate it. My sisters' relationship with them, on the other hand, is failing rapidly as she absolutely HATES them doing it and often has violent arguments with them about it. I always sort of stood on the side-lines keeping out of the way, but the last three days my brother and sister have been away leaving only mum, dad and I each night.      It was in this time that I began to realize just how bad the addiction is, because on top of the drug, they drink too which only adds to the crazy warping of their normal selves. Fortunately neither of them ever get particularly violent or anything, just very... slow, lecturing and just basically not in their normal frame of mind.      You can't have a normal conversation with them, it just turns into the same damn thing as last night. My dad is particularly bad, as he will tell me the same stories every single night, if only slightly different. Tonight I couldn't handle it and dad was starting on another lecture about how he is "sorry that he drinks and smokes but that I should just enjoy the moment" or whatever, I just got up and left mid-sentence. I could tell they hadn't expected it, and mum came after me. She tried to be all playful and whatnot, but it was just annoying. I tried to shake her off but she just turned it into some kind of game - I eventually had to yell it at her before she got the picture. She left a little deflated which made me feeling slightly bad, but not enough to justify their drinking/smoking.      Tonight, I really just wanted to hang out with them while I have been distancing myself from the computer a bit and my siblings are away, but it just... isn't them. It's like my parents have abandoned me, leaving two psycho strangers in their place. I don't really get to see that much of my dad as he works early morning til dinner weekdays, and on the weekends he goes out with mum for breakfast and lunch, and works outside on our property. All the gaps in between he is either exhausted and hungry (which generally comes with a bit of crabbiness), or drunk and high. I don't think he realizes that before long, all his kids will be grown up and moved out... But in a way I think he doesn't really care.      We have all tried telling them how much it bothers us, and they have more than got that message, but I think that because it's both of them doing it together, they feel that is all the support they need, nothing else matters. Perhaps if it were only one of them, we could have disposed of the disgusting addiction years ago.       What else can I/we do? Please help!      Thank you, in advance.

20081025120719AAlk9pa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I go out with my friend's ex (she dumped him)?	So, my friend and this boy have gone out for a year and a few months. Me and him became pretty good friends because of this. About a month ago, she broke up with him because she just didn't love him anymore and she was having fun meeting new guys. I messaged him asking if he was okay and he was reallyyy upset about it. So we started talking a lot because he used to always talk to her nad now he didn't have anyone to talk to. About two weeks after the break up he came home (he's in college). We walked around town together and then my friend drove by and I felt so awkward. She got really pissed at him, because apparently she always thought something was going on between us. They talked about it the next day though and she was like "that was just my initial reaction to get mad but I know you wouldn't ever do that." Then the next day we hung out again and we were sitting down together and then he was like "I really want to kiss you." And I didn't know if I liked him but I really wanted him to kiss me to so we did. Since then we have been talking on the phone everyday and we've gotten really close and we both like each other. I haven't told any of my friends yet because I don't want my friend to find out because I could see how it would look from her point of view and she would definately be mad and my friends would probably agree with her. I really don't want to lose my friends. And the other thing is, even though he says he is, I still don't think he's over my friend. Which I don't care about too much now  except that if this starts to get more serious, which it probably will, it will definately be an issure. like what if she wants him back all of a sudden? I just don't know what to do cause I really like him but I also don't want to lose my friends or get hurt. What should I do?!?

20080330125950AA0cJjQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My best friend likes her too!?	Ok so me and my best friend go to different schools. Me and him are both funny, but he is hilarious. Unfortunately he goes overboard and turns people off of him by insulting them accidentally. Not to be mean but he isnt exactly slim either. I am bteer looking then him. Me and him had been in relationships a few weeks ago and, unbeknownst to each other, we each had ended those relationships like 2 weeks ago. Before I had gotten into my relationship, I had also liked another girl who went to my friends school. I then began going out with sum1 else and told my friend if he liked the girl i liked before, he could go for it. He decided to try it for a couple days and then he himself got into another relationship with sum1 else. Now me and him have both ended the other relationships and I have gone back to the girl i had liked before, Alex. Unfortunately, my friend now likes her too. The other night we were all at a party and my friend was trying to get very close with her.

I don't really understand. He knows I'm not a guy... I've heard of girls being "like the guys"... but I don't act like a guy at all. None of my other guy friends call me dude. This guy just always calls me dude.. I don't get it at all. It gets kind of annoying. I don't know if I should just roll with it or be offended.
20081004075111AAdM3B9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I buy her a wrist watch as a gift?	She has a boyfriend, I have a girlfriend. We like each other, and like spending time together. Although sex is a possibility, I neither feel comfortable cheating my girlfriend, nor does she feel comfortable cheating her bf. We have both sneaked a light kiss in a restaurant. We don't want to go further than that, yet, the flesh is weak, though.      We actually cherish the relationship, and I want to give her a very nice gift. I'm thinking of a wrist watch, as I've heard her make comments that shows she likes a watch. What else could I buy for her if not that wrist watch. Thank you guys for reading.

20080311144101AAb99KG	Family & Relationships;Family	Un consejo sobre  un ni?o de 5 a?os…  URGENTE, SE ME ACABA EL MATRIMONIO!!!!?	Es un ni?o sano,  sin ningún problema físico o emocional, estudia y dentro de las cosas de la vida puede decirse que tiene todo lo que quiere en la vida… o sea no es falto de amor, afecto o cosas materiales.         últimamente se enoja mucho cuando le piden hacer algo que no desea, patea el piso entre-cierra los ojos y mira a la mama o a la persona que le rega?a con ira… rabia… le ha pegado a la mama en la calle y tiende a pegarse contra las paredes (cabezazos).          Estudia, esta en clases de taekwondo, patinaje… ingles… clases que a el le agradan y no se molesta por ir.        (bueno la mama y el papa están separados desde que el tenia 1 a?o… pero mantienen buenas relaciones, no hay presencia de padrastro, la mama lo ama incondicionalmente y con el papa mantiene una relación cercana y estable.  Sabe que sus papas son amigos y que cada uno tiene su propia vida, el no desea vivir con su papa, solo en vacaciones se va con el, tiempo que le grada pero siempre desea volver con la mama).      Mi papel en este asunto? Yo soy la pareja actual de la mama, llevamos 3 a?os de convivencia y el ni?o ha crecido con migo, mantenemos muy buena relación, soy yo quien juega con el,  a quien le cuenta sus miedos, sus cosas, me quiere mucho y el dice que si me separo de la mama el se iría a vivir con migo, no con la mama o con el papa….       Pero desde unos 4 meses nuestra relación se ha deteriorado un poco, pues no estoy de acuerdo con su comportamiento… y la relación con la mama va de picada por que no soporto su forma de educar al ni?o…      Yo no soporto su impertinencia y últimamente he comenzado a tomarle fastidio por sus  pataletas, pues no hay ningún factor que le este causando un da?o…      La mama le da gusto exagerado en todo, si quiere 5 chicles, 5 chicles le compra…lo amenaza con no dejarlo ir a clase de taek.. si no se porta bien, pero el chino se porta como un demonio e igual lo deja ir…  (interrumpe a los adultos, se le dice no se suba con zapatos a la cama y mas lo hace… esta comenzando a tener conductas de causar dolor a  las mascotas) cuando intento intervenir y colocar reglas, la mama me lo impide recordándome que es si hijo!!!      Que hago?  Mi profesión es psicóloga, pero ya sabes… en casa de herrero asador de palo!!!      Algún buen consejo????

20080105231613AAuqR78	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you help me?	ok well my boyfriend and i have been going out for about 3 months and we have known each other for about a year and a half and i love him and he flirts with other girls that he knows and ex girlfriends. yes most girls wouldnt allow that but i flirt with other guys so ya i would be a hippocrate if i told him not to flirt. but the fact would have to be its just not girls that he knows its ex girlfriends. so what should i do i love him so much and i dont want to break up. but if you could give me some advice that would be great.
20080105234503AAL9s5Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did she like me?	Well i never talk to her. She was in some of my classes but we never spoke. Then all of a sudden she would wave to me s lot and smile at me a lot and then she would start a convo sometimes and laugh a lot. I didn't know what to think and i am not the most confident person so when she waved i didn't wanna be one of those people who wave when the person    being waved to was behind them. I know she was waving at me though.   I also when to a party and she came from the party to hug me and say hi.   I guess maybe she thought that i was kinda an **** because i never waved back. this was the end of the year and then the next year just a few months later, she never even said hi or waved at all.   I am just unsure of this because i am not the most confident person and i think i may have become not ugly recently :P. Who knows.   Did she like me?

She told my other friend that she likes me and she flirts with me all the time and let me flirt with her but my friend doesnt like it and the girl lives 30 mins away from my house and i dont have a car but my friend does. He calls her all the time and he can go see her anytime but i can only see her once or twice a week. She basically wants to decide between me and my friend but i dont think my friend deserves her because he creeps her out and does weird stuff. I actually am nice to her and she likes me a little too but i am not sure. Please help me.   What should i do? i really like this girl

Anywany 3 weeks ago was my first encounter with her. I got that feeling of someone starring at me for some reason, and so i looked around and in the direction was this beautiful woman gazing at me. Upon noticing my intitial reaction was not good. i quickly turned around to talk to my friend, because i was nervous. Then to my suprize she had come up right next to me with, "excuse me, may i get you anything"....there was my chance....but guess what i blew it, i said no thank you and turned away to my friend. Its been three weeks and i havent said a word, but i want to get back up on my horse and show her who i am, and get a number and possibly pursue something. My question to you is why the hell did i "pussy-out" and are my chances completely ruined? also, how do i go about approaching her and hoping she forgot what a dumbass i was?

20080308233727AAiCYRG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I "restart" this relationship?	We dated 2 months and got pretty serious, but she almost left me for her ex (who she dated for 6 year and almost married, so I can see where she could have wanted to go back) but after a month of debating who she should go to, she realized that she wants to see where me and her goes.  Well only a few days after that she became very depressed and another month went by of not seeing her as much and her just being miserable, and no kissing or anything she just wanted me there as her friend.  Well she's starting to feel more like herself and wants to see me more often as a friend.  She's afraid of letting the "just a friend" barrier going down (she 'wanted' to kiss me after lunch today but didn't, so it'll probably happen later on), and that if it did happen she wants to take it slower "this time".  So, do I just not bring up the situation anymore and just play it cool, or what?

20090203114408AAs6oU0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I think he might be cheating, what would you do?	Ok, please bear with me...We are not married, but you guys are way more mature and experienced. I have been seeing my boyfriend since October. We both claimed to have ben exclusive to each other, but both have strayed. Since then, (in December) we confessed everything...supposedly and vowed to be honest and straight-forward from that point on. The problem is, he must have forgotten that convo and continued to lie constantly. He says that he wants to be with me and that he loves me and that he is not lying, but I know he is. You see, I too matters into my own hands recently and viewed his call log. He has been talking to his ex-wife a WHOLE LOT more than usually, but claims its about there daughter. I'm talking numerous lengthy calls throughout the day. She lives out of state, but still. Also, last night, he says he was going to sleep and got off the phone with me, but he called another woman and talked for about 30 minutes last night...this was around 10:15...wtf. He DOES NOT know that I view his log. I nonchalantly asked him this morning what he did when we got off the phone and he said he went to sleep after about 30 mins. When I asked him what he was doing, he said nothing, but I know he was on the phone. He swears up and down that he wasn't doing anything and said that he wasn't on the phone...why would he lie. I want to confront him so badly, but he HATES that I snoop. I have done it before, found stuff, and confronted him, but he says he will leave if I do it again. The calls very well might be innocent, but then why would he lie??? What would you do??? Confront him about the lies or hold it in??? He is acting like everything is just peachy between us, but has been very irritated due to some unknown reason. Help me..what to do?

So Last september I was talking with a guy, while I had a boyfriend and some of the conversation got out of hand and I had said some things I really shouldn't have said. My boyfriend found out and we had an argument and broke up.. about 3 months or so later we got back together. During those three months I did some things with the guy I was talking too prior, and we were basically dating. But I ended it and got back together with my boyfriend. He doesn't want me talking to this guy or hanging out with him but I still want to be friends with him... What Should I do? Should I not want to be friends with him? Should I be respecting my boyfriend's wishes, since i was unfaithful to him prior?

We talk about things like if he has girl issues or if i have a problem with guys. He's always there for me, plus were neighbors. A couple of summers ago i thought there was something between us because he would call me every single morning to wake me up and say hey, or we would both sneek out and walk around, it was all chill but i did like him. When he went to high school though we didnt talk as much and he became somewhat of a jerk. I didnt like him anymore but recently feelings for him are starting to come back, but i dont think he would ever go out with me because of the way i look because he normally goes for the skinnier girls and im just not skinny. What should I do? im so confused.

20080620130811AA3CiMh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help!! Need advice?	There is this guy that I met this year. It started off as all he wanted to do was talk to me and I found him to be very annoying. As the year went on I think we both started to get a crush on eachother. But nothing happened (he never asked me out). It is now summer and we made a deal to meet eachother. I gave him my email and phone number and in return I got his email. I was leaving the day before me and we were both going to the same place yet still no email. He promised he would. One day he gave me a hug just as friends and at that moment I knew he was the one. It was like magic!! He has never made me feel bad about myself or how I look and I just am scared that I will never see him again! My head says give up trying to email him he is just not going to reply but my heart is saying if its ment to be its ment to be. We come from to different worlds he is like the bad boy and I am the goody two shoes. All of his friends say he likes me but I just want to know what to do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

How many guys are out there that quickly move on to the next girl when they hear that she wants to wait till marriage? I'm 20 and I really want to wait till marriage to have sex. One of the biggest problems for me is finding the right guy who will also wait. I had one boyfriend who was very much willing to wait, but i really do think he was infatuated with me and maybe a lil pyscho. another guy was also willing but i thought we didn't have much of a connection so that ended. Then there were 2 other bf's who agreed with me but constantly tried to get me to go all the way. How many young guys out there do you think are willing to wait? And another guy i dated once told me that 90% of guys cheat..is this true or fiction?

I was just wondering when would be a good amount of time after this to call her... I met her Wednesday and it's now Friday.

Well, my boyfriend and I have been going out for a few months...but whenever a discussion starts to lead to something...relationship related like kissing or just our relationship, it gets awkward and we both move away from the subject.  I feel like if we're going to be in a relationship, we should be able to talk about things.  But for some reason we can't move past the fact that we aren't just friends.  He doesn't even acknowledge me as his girlfriend.  Instead, he calls me his best friend.  But he asked me to be his girlfriend months ago...!?  We don't even hold hands or anything.  The only thing we've done is hug, and that took us a month to get used to.  What should I do?  I guess I want to actually feel like I'm in a relationship.

Para hacer la historia corta te puedo decir, que hace 10 a?os tuve ese primer amor de la infancia. Por razones de la vida él se mudó a otro lugar, pasaron como 3 a?os sin verlo y la verdad no sentía nada, sí estaba al tanto de su vida, pero no hablábamos. Luego conozco a un hombre maravilloso que amo mucho y actualmente es mi esposo. ?Cuál es el problema? Que siempre he mantenido contacto con ese amor de infancia y con toda su familia pues me adoran al igual que su hija. (El tiene su pareja pero no está casado) Siempre nos hemos querido mucho, incluso mi familia también lo quiere mucho. Todos saben, incluso mi esposo, que él y su familia son muy especiales para mi. Pero el problema está en que alguna vez le escribí una carta diciéndole todo lo que nunca le dije y lo especial q sería siempre aún cuando nuestras vidas fueran dos mundos diferentes. PERO EL NUNCA ME DIJO NADA... es muy poco expresivo, nos seguimos hablando como si nada, ya que prometí no mencionarle el tema hasta q él quisiera. Se que él me ve como alguien especial, pero no entiendo pq razón nunca ha querido sincerarse conmigo aunque sea para decirme q no hay nada más que decirnos.      NO sé si el prefiere verme feliz y no molestarme, pues yo no voy a dejar mi pareja.      O Simplemente no le importa el asunto...y pues no pierde tiempo.

I got off the bus before her and was waiting in the station when she came stood next to me. I thought she wanted me to say something since she decided to stand next to me, but since she had her back turned to me I didn't. She then turned around and was looking in my direction but not directly at me. After a while of this she left for the stairs and went down to the subway.

20081006010921AAyS8ZE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He dumped me for a redneck woman?	My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. We had a great relationship, he needed some emotional help and I had helped him, he was insecure, depressed, low self esteem, and overweight.  We worked out through all these problems. We were there for each other, we loved each other very deeply. Out sex life was great. We never fought. Everything was going well. We were in love, we were very close, best friends, emotionally and physically bonded.       The last couple of months in our relationship, I started noticing that he was not as close to me any longer, he was distant. I asked him if he still loved me, he said yes, I asked him again if he was in love with me still, because I told him I was deeply in love with him, he said yes, he was in love with me. I asked him if he was sure, he said yes.       Then 2 weeks later (1 week before our 5th year anniversary), he calls me from his cell phone, and tells me there is this woman who called him, and asked him for coffee, he said yes; Then he called me and broke up with me.      It's been a month and a half now that they are dating. In the mean time he has met me for coffee, upon my request to get some closure. He told me some interesting things about her.      He said that he did not tell her about me and him, (5yr relationship), I told him, great you're starting a new relationship on a big fat lie.      Then he said that she has 2 boys, one is 15 does not go to school, and the other is 17, also does not go to school, and on top of that he's an alcoholic.      This woman who's a redneck as he put it, was the one who called my boyfriend and asked him out, saying if he wanted to talk that she was there for him. I think instead of her calling a man and saying  she's there for him, she should be there for her disfunctional kids.      I'm so hurt, I still love him very much!!! I don't know what went wrong, I told him to think about our 5 year relationship, I told him I wanted us to salvage it. But he told me he was having too much fun with her, going out everyday, they both have the same days off, and they go out everyday. I told him that is so superficial and it will not last.      Please help, I'm im love with him, and would like to salvage our relationship.

I was having a conversation with my "boyfriend" and he said "I feel bad, I like someone else at school." I sighed and said, "Oh, is she better than me?" and he said no. He told me he loved and said he felt sorry. I said whatever and rolled my eyes. I told him he should just date her because he obviously likes her more.       He won't date he because he says he loves me. Does he "love me" like he says he does? Is he just using me?

20081008060446AAjFtpI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Naked pics of another man's wife? WTF?	Ok, so my husband and I are both military he is away in training and was using another man's phone (Joe) when he came across pics of that man's wife naked. He then sent them to another one of his friends (Bob). That friend then turned around and sent it to my husbands cell phone. The only reason i even found out about the pic was because Bob's wife was snooping though her husbands phone and found the pic. She then called me and told me about it. I called my husband and confronted him. He admitted to sending the pic to Bob and that its wasn't anything sexual it was meant as a joke because Joe's wife cheats on him all the time. (Honestly i think my husband is covering for Joe. I think Joe sent the picture) What makes me even more upset is myself and Bob's wife went over to Joe's house and told her about it. She wasnt even upset, she all most seemed flattered. I just don't know what to do. Should i be angry? If it was only a suppose to be a joke why did Bob send it to my husbands phone? Why didnt he tell me about it? Should i be worried. I mean other than this my husband is a great guy. Im just so confused!!! I mean we have made it though several deployments for both him and I. Why did he feel the need to do something this stupid.

20081014153558AAJ0veJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it a sin, premarital sex ?	Many people think the bible says that sex outside of marriage is a sin.  But the bible is unclear.  In Exodus, chapter 20, in the 10 commandments, we are told you should not commit adultery.  Adultery is not defined as having sex outside of marriage.  It is defined as having sex with a married person.  Nothing is said prohibiting sexual relations between two unmarried people.  In fact, in Leviticus we are given a list of every situation in which we should not have sex.  We're not to have sex with married people, or with family members, or with animals.  We are not prohibited from having sex with an unmarried person who is not in our family.      Some places in the bible state that fornication is a sin.  Some wrongly interpret that to mean sex outside of marriage.  That is not true.  The greek translation identifies fornication as being any "illicit (illegal) sexual activity".  But in Leviticus, the bible does not mention sex between two unmarried people as being illicit.        In fact, we read where some of God's greatest leaders, such as King David (who God called a man"after his own heart"), had hundreds of wives and hundreds of unmarried concubines (women kept in the house for the purpose of sex).  None of these were considerd sins.  It is only when David had sex with another man's wife that he committed the sin of adultery.

20081108061244AAivVEz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I feel less awkward around him?	So, here's my question, you could say my experience with guys is not as experienced at some other people I do know. I've never had a boyfriend, never been kissed. It's all good though, I'm only 15. So I have this crush on a guy I met at homecoming, he was really sweet. I did ask him out, but forgot to give him my number. So, I'm thinking of putting it on his locker via a note. But here is my question, how do I feel less nervous, he's the first guy I've had like a serious 'crush' on in a long time, and I want to get to know him better. Last night though I saw him in the play, and I saw him afterward, and I just felt like I couldn't get my words together, tips? I hate feeling like this.

20081120234208AAFO8t0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How are you suppose to be friends with someone who broke up with you?	She broke up with me and she kepted on saying, that we have to be friends afterwards.  I wasn't even friends with her before, we just started dating.  I told her, no, I am sorry, we can't be friends.  And she started crying.  Then telling me to call her today, tomorrow, next month, whenever, and we could be friends.  I dropped her home, and told her I was going to miss her.      I guess at some point, I must've loved her, because I feel worst that I made her cry, and hurt her, than because she broke up with me.        So we text back and forth, and I told her that okay, if being friends will make her happy, then I'll put my feelings aside, and we can be friends.  But that we shouldn't see each other for at least a month, to clear both our minds, and then we can try being friends.      How are you suppose to be friends with someone who broke up with you when you still love them?  I honestly don't think I can....but I don't want to see her hurt.

She is a county girl really boring, slow, and just does not have it all together. Anyway, we are friends and hang out. (She became replacement for another similar one I finally got rid of her). SIGH................, and this one we attend Sunday Bible study class at night together driving together. I started to think "hmm, everyone must think we are together, I mean like dating or something" I was thinking "that would be horrible~!" Especially there is a girl I really like in the class. Well, she was not there last night. Anyway, I was thinking "gee I hope no one thing we are together" I told her about my concern, she did not get it what I meant. She said "You are acting like an elementary school kids, I do not worry about things like that". I told her, well I DO~! Last night some guy came up to me and say "Is she your wife~!???"

20081113013146AAULcWC	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I deal with an emotionally abusive family member?	My brother is terrible to me. I'm eighteen and he's twenty two, but we both still live at home. I don't want to move out yet because I'm still studying and working and don't have enough cash to move out just yet, and he isn't going to move out because he's spoilt here.   I'm so sick of the **** he gives me. He's terrible to me. I had an eating disorder where I was bulimic, then anorexic. I'm a normal, healthy weight now but he now says horrible things like 'hey tubby, want another cake' and 'I'd let you eat it (it was the last bit of icecream) but you'll just throw it up later'. All of that's in my past but everytime he brings it up I feel like I'm going through it again.   He also says things like 'hows the assignment going?' and no matter what I say he replies with something like 'yeah who cares, you'll fail it anyone' when I get great marks at school.   He also can't understand why I don't do things for him. If he wants me to cook him dinner he'll tell me to, and doesn't understand it when I say I'm busy or to do it himself. It's like only his needs matter and it's driving me insane.   My parents don't discipline him, they never have. It's why he's the way he is and it makes me so angry. I can't deal with this anymore. He doesn't listen to reason and is a terrible person, but expects me to do anything he wants.   What do I do? Does anybody have any suggestions?

She literally laughs A LOT. lol   - And the strange one, whenever she sees that I have a water bottle, she asks for a sip out of it o_o which normally a girl would never do to me lol      These are all kind of lame but seem to relate to all of the hints that a girl likes someone. BTW, yes I do like her back. We've never been together outside of school, since we've only known each other for about a month. We are both freshmen in high school.

20081112212543AAnTScH	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do for my friend (who's in college)'s birthday?	First of all, let me explain our relationship. We have been friends for awhile. His gf recently broke up with him. We started talking more after this and then kissed. We both like each other, but he still isn't completely over her. We kind of had a thing for a couple weeks but I decided for now that we should talk to each other like when we were friends, until he gets over her. He was really upset by this but he understood. Anyway, his birthday is coming up this Sunday and I don't know what to do for it. I wanted to visit him (he lives about 2 hrs away) before but he told me he has this huge test he needs to study for all weekend and also I don't think it would be a good idea with my recent decision. I guess I could send him a package? But what would I put in it? And would it even get there on time? Do they even deliver packages on Sundays? What else can I do? I really want to make it special for him. Any suggestions will be appreciated!
20081106123232AALHiAI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can you ask a guy out?	I really really like this guy and I'm crazy for him. I keep dreaming about him and I always think about him. It's not just a teenage crush because I've had crushes but this is completely different. I don't wanna say it was love at first sight but ever since I met him he's been nice and never seemed like a jerk.   I just don't know what the smartest move would be now.   I don't want to rush it, but at the same time, I don't wanna wait until he's found some other girl.   I do talk to him a lot and we're friends, I don't know how he feels. But I know I'll regret it if I don't do anything. If he finds out I like him, I want him to find out from me, but at the same time, I don't know how to confront him about it, or whether I SHOULD confront him about it.   So what should I do?   Thanks in advance! :)
20081103195153AA95XTQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Weekend plans, Truth or Dare and my best guyfriend - ugh.?

20081031035046AAWiU5W	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should i be worried about the things my husband is doing?	ok my husband and i have been married a few months and been together for almost 6 years.      that being said he has never cheated on me, that i know of, and i really don't have any proof that he has even been close.      but i just have some gut feelings and he's always denied any kind of cheating. he is not the typical type of guy in the fact that he doesn't go to clubs and pick up on girls, he's not cocky, he's actually very sensitive and loving.      (he does not live near me and didn't at the time of these issues, because he's in the military)      but he has done these things that make me worry...   1. went horse back riding for a couple of hours with his good friend's girlfriend.   2. danced with another girl on one of the few occasions that he did go out clubbing (and was drunk)   3. always has an excuse for where he's been. he's supposed to get off work at 3:00 but doesn't get home until 6 or 7 and says that his boss made him stay late.   4. he had a "friend" who became obsessed with him, he would take her home and give her his jacket when it was cold, and they'd go out and things of that nature. she definitely knew about me because he would be on the phone with me and say "i love you sara".   5. said this about his good friends girlfriend "what if she cheated on you with me", talking to his good friend about her.      should i be worried or am i just being rediculous?

I really don't know what to do. I feel sick right now. I don't know whether I lied or twisted the truth or whatever to my boyfriend...well at the time he wasnt my boyfriend...we were on a break and stuff...and there was another guy who I'm not on good terms with now. And my boyfriend who I'm back with from before read some of my very old sent messages...even though I didn't want him to, and he found out a load of stuff. And even though it was a long time ago I know he's going to be so angry cuz I didn't tell him what happened, and he doesn't understand that I regret the whole thing. I just don't know what to do. I didn't sleep with this in between guy btw...but I am sleeping with my boyfriend. If that makes any difference whatsoever. Any comments are useful. Thanks x

20081112132717AAKwhOH	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do about my reckless daughter?	She is 18yrs old and has been driving me crazy since she was 12. She won't listen to anyone, and always makes the wrong choices people places and things. I have had physical confrontations with her numerous times, and I refused to go through it again so I called her father and he came and got her. She was living with him and before long she was up to her old tricks, lying, stealing and sneaking out... She ended up going to jail for 6 months when we found out she was pregnant, so she had her baby in jail. Long story short, she hasn't changed one bit only the bag got bigger now that she is dragging the baby around to different peoples houses to crash. Yes I tried to step in and take the baby only to again get into another fight with her. And I just found out she is pregnant again!!! She doesn't live anywhere, where ever she can lay her head for that night is home. Help Me!!! What should I do, she is on probation and that doesn't help because she is lying to him too.

20081114031823AA7qXEs	Family & Relationships;Family	Grandparents getting visitation rights?	My uncle was killed in 2007 in a car accident.  He left behind 4 children who were then all under the age of 18.  He had custody of the 2 oldest and when he passed the oldest came to live with my grandma because her and her mother hated each other from the time she was 17 until she was 18. and the 2nd oldest went back to living with his mother.        She hates my family, and has refused the 3 kids from seeing my family wat so ever.  the second oldest is now 17 and comes to family functions behind his mothers back, partially because we are all he has left of his father (his words) and he was in the accident that killed his father.  He is also the only boy.  The 3rd child is now 14 and we have only seen her 2 times since the funeral. once was when we were at the store but her mother made sure she didnt talk to us and the 2nd time was when she was at her friends we all met up for lunch behind her mothers back.  The youngest just turned 9 and we havent seen her since the funeral, which was when she was 7.  the 2 middle children have given us their cell phne numbers to keep in contact with them, which their mother has no idea about.     My grandma has been falling deeper and deeper into depression since that happened and has been hospitalized due to her health and we have almost lost her 2 times since the death.  She wants more then anything to see her grandchildren since thats all she has left of her son.  I know every state is different and such, but does anyone know if it is possible for grandparents getting visitation rights?   Before my uncle died, We had every other weekend family get to gethers wen he had all his kids and its just not the same anymore.  We are such a close family  I want to help my grandma out badly.        Im sorry if this is a little tooo detailed but i had a lot to say.  Any advice??

No matter what age they are how do you talk to children about their father not wanting to see them.  The kids keep asking when they are going to see their dad but I don't know what to tell them.  He pays child support at minimum but won't take the time to see his kids.  He always backs out and makes excuses.  He tells everyone how much he loves and misses his kids.  He has people thinking that I am keeping him away from them.  Why do some men do this?  What can I do?  I know I can't make him see his kids but I don't know what to say to them.  Please help.
