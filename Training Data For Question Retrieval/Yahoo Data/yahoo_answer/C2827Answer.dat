JnLoHaoAaa	First ask if it's a vodka or gin martini, and what liquor they would prefer (many do if it's a topshelf). Ask if they want it straight (no ice) or on the rocks (with ice) and if they would like an olive or not. Sometimes people prefer a lemon or lime twist (just the rind with the juice swiped along the inside rim of the glass)|`|Jzr8UmFKaa	do you want an olive with that?|`|k8HpMaHxaa	On the rocks, or straight up. If they would live olive, a twist ect. Preference on liquor, if they dont specify when ordering.
jjVJxUp5aa	YES, they do get to keep the tips they make during the shift. Yes you are supposed to tip them as well. Many people don't know this. Just because you are a poor college student doesn't mean you have an excuse not to tip them, THEY WORK FOR TIPS. They work very hard and 'walking food 2ft to your car' isn't all that the job entails believe it or not.|`|j02V9pIbaa	I don't tip at Sonic. I'm a college student and don't have the money. Besides, I'd be more than happy to walk the 2ft to go inside and grab it myself. It's not like pizza where they drove across town to get it to you. Walking 2ft to my car doesn't earn you anything in my book. If I need to, then I also need to tip the people at carls jr who walk to my table to bring me my food.|`|AA11421521	are we suppose to tip them wow i feel really bad.

UJZZ4bnLaa	usually restaurants have a Server Assistant position    every night and the server who works that  position gets  min wage.  <br>  <br>  good servers can easily make anywhere from $15-20 an hour on tips.  sidework is a part of the job description.    to be honest  if a server has  a 3 table station   in a dinner or lunch rush  3 -  $5 tables an hour  should be no problem   a good server should have no problem getting 5 or more!    even if you are a $2 tip level server  with a 2 table stattion  if you turn those tables 2 times an hour  you make  $12./ hr<br>  <br>  the hour  they work before and the  hour or so after they work is so they are set up so when they are making tips they can serve as many tables as fast as possible.<br>  <br>  usually the smart servers know how to do their sidework as the night goes along  this way when their shift is finished  they can leave quickly.   usually the servers who complain about  not making min wage during their sidework are the  newer servers or  ones who spend their  time in the break room instead of doing running sidework.<br>  <br>  jobs with tip based pay are written into  the min wage  laws.    some states like California Oregon,  have laws that dont include tips  in those states  servers get paid min wage in addition to their tips.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	There's no law saying wait staff must be working for tips, period. They just simply must be "on the clock" and receiving their hourly wage. The taxes taken out of their paychecks for tips are figured based on a percentage of their total tickets, not hours worked.|`|UrYteTK7aa	Where i work they pay you minimum wage while opening and then once the store opens it automatically clocks you out and back in at the server hourly wage.

If you can't afford food go to a food pantry or a shelter and get something to hold you over until you get some money.<br>  <br>  <br>  Reminds me of this story!!!<br>  <br>  I was in Wal-Mart buying a large bag of Purina for my dogs and was in line to check out. A woman behind me asked if I had a dog... Duh!<br>  I was feeling a bit crabby so on impulse, I told her no, I was starting The Purina Diet again, although I probably shouldn't because I'd ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care unit with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IV's in both arms. Her eyes about bugged out of her head.<br>  I went on and on with the bogus diet story and she was totally buying it I told her that it was an easy, inexpensive diet and that the way it works is to load your pockets or purse with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you fee l hungry. The package said the food is nutritionally complete so I was going to try it again. I have to mention here that practically everyone in the line was by now enthralled with my story, particularly a tall guy behind her.<br>  Horrified, she asked if something in the dog food had poisoned me and was that why I ended up in the hospital. I said no.....I'd been sitting in the street licking my butt when a car hit me.<br>  I thought the tall guy was going to have to be carried out the door|`|d771ac26c54693f162bb53c76472def4aa	even though this question is totally bogus here is an answer.<br>  <br>  people who find themselves in life or death situations have to make life or death decisions.

It will bring out the wild side, and you will be sniffing butts in no time. Just be careful not to chase cats down the motorway.<br>  <br>  OR......Go to the shops and buy some food!! But eating the dog food is better because it will make you strong|`|f6f123d1de5cfc1006bad11b8d6e757aaa	there has to be somethinggggggg to eat besides that..<br>  but if you have to..<br>  go for it. haha it aint gonna taste too good.|`|SaTa58emaa	yes... but go to the food bank.|`|c9cbbae9664e8ae4184f1b8f28b0acfdaa	It will be safe, yes.

Y47WgY4Laa	Where is it being held? This sort of thing usually attracts a dressed-up crowd - guys in suits, ladies in dresses, etc.<br>  <br>  If you're comfortable in a skirt or dress, I'd go with something simple, elegant and feminine.<br>  <br>  How about a classic black dress? Not too short or low-cut, of course. You can then 'make it your own' with bold accessories, an unusual bag, vibrant nails, wickedly naughty shoes or anything else you love to wear. A black pencil skirt and a chic top or blazer would also be ideal. If you're more comfortable in trousers, then make sure they're smart - not jeans.<br>  <br>  The general rule is classy, not casual - so enjoy being dolled up for the evening. Have a great time! :)|`|5OmY6S1Waa	a dress
TiUDVALZaa	Yes. The steakhouse at the Rittenhouse hotel on Rittenhouse Square is absolutely lovely. My father and I go there when he comes visit me from abroad. And their steaks are great while their burgers are amazing!|`|pbV7dnKKaa	There are a lot of great restaurants in Philly that might interest you. Some are fine dining type that are still reasonably priced. ou can always look at an online yellow pages to see if anything strikes your interest! Look into Valention on the Square, might be a nice place to take them.|`|7uznrLBXaa	Beau Monde.  Everyone - and I mean everyone - raves about it!  It's a French creperie and even my "it's Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast" parents love it!  The staff is quirkily Bohemian but very sweet.|`|QRBRvDYMaa	There is this place on 3rd and Market I like, Farmicia. It's kinda "green"...like organic. Nice atmosphere.
Q4NFFBizaa	pizza hut has the best breadsticks but papa johns has the better pizza!|`|Lvlk8OO5aa	Papa John's is way better, but we just ordered the ultimate pepperoni pizza on Sunday and didn't like it. There was way too much pepperoni. I ended up picking it all off, but it took what little cheese there was with it.|`|XT9TvcUQaa	Papa Johns is delish:Large sausage and breadsticks with garlic sauce only<br>  <br>  Pizza hut is alright but their pizza can be greasy; I like their breadsticks. Don't eat the bacon macaroni pasta it is nasty|`|vLOjcH7paa	Pizza Hut is nasty! Even the pizza just smells nasty!<br>  Papa John's is delicious! Mmm...breadsticks with garlic or cheese sauce!

Papa Johns end crust is too dry and blah and the dipping sauce does not help.|`|xru6IDLoaa	PAPA JOHNS!! if you have a danatos near by, go there!! GREAT PIZZA!!|`|GHd84xipaa	Papa Johns for pizza,but i like Pizza Hut for their pasta dishes.|`|174ecf3bb83bf13823e446b49ed3fa4daa	Papa Johns is way better than Pizza Hut, even their breadsticks. They have a variety of breadsticks you can choose from. The cheese sticks are a meal in themselves! Plus you get the marinara and garlic sauces for dipping. We recently discovered we like the chocolate turnover thingies. I'd rather have Papa Johns over Pizza Hut any day.|`|yXno8yIkaa	Yum Papa John's! The ultimate pepperoni is really good!<br>  <br>  We  usually order pepperoni and italian sausage on one, and ham pineapple & bacon on another. <br>  But Dominos has the best cheesy bread ever! With the marinara sauce, delish!|`|f5e77b5c7067c9a50f9b069d33657c40aa	Pizza Hut!  with Extra Cheese, or like Bacon and Extra Cheese|`|oNQeg4xWaa	papa johns, pizza hut sucks.|`|fQOxUstCaa	pizza hut hands down...i dont care what anybody says
