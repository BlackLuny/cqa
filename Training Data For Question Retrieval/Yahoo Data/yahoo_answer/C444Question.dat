The last time we had one was about 2 years ago, we got rid of them quickly. So now we have this issue again. I'm pretty sure that it's due to our terribly nasty neighbors.  They are the nastiest folks, trash just everywhere outside. I'm going to call the public health department and file a complaint, I don't know how much more of their trash I can put up out of my yard. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has ever purchased those ultrasonic plug-in rodent deterrent. I went to Home Depot today and they had a pack of 3 for about $19.99 and it said that it could take up to 2 weeks for it to work and that you might need to get more than one for each room (larger room). I want to know if anyone has ever used these before and if they work? I don't want to waste my money on something that doesn't work. So, is it worth is?

We love almost every aspect/feature of it besides the carpet.  We are planning on replacing it with hardwood floors, however we have run into a problem:  in the central room (the one you see when you first walk in) there is the staircase with a landing above, both with wooden rails.  Also, the trim around the room/door/windows is this same wood as the stairs/landing which is more chestnut/orange in color.  This is not the color I want for my floors...I prefer either a much lighter wood or the much darker.  I have had opinions and suggestions about staining the existing wood to match the floors if I go with a darker wood....but if not (as I am partial to the lighter) what would you suggest as a complimentary wood tone/color for my floors?

20090309161634AAaWvbV	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	New Homeowner-- overly eager 'helper' problem?	Hi, I am a single parent new homeowner of a dilapidated foreclosure abused by previous owners.  My child is 13 and has had a best friend since 1st grade.  His dad has been very nice at times throughout this period, and we have alternately taken the kids to various things.  He (dad) does have a girlfriend and they have a 1 year old.  I had told him about this house, and asked him if he knew how to turn on the water heater, as I wasn't getting it to work.      Ever since then, he has come over every day.  I haven't moved in yet, as it needs a lot of work, and I wanted to sand the floors first.  He came over last Saturday to 'help' and stopped by to get the key as I wasn't ready yet. When I got there, he had begun ripping out the kitchen. Yes, everything would need replacing, it is old a gross, but I can't afford to do it all at once.  I did ask him for help with a tree, as the new neighbor was concerned about power lines, but didn't expect him to do it the very next day...back to the kitchen, he ripped out everything and it is sitting in the back yard.  He insists I need a professional to do the sanding of the floors, even though I have done it myself. He sent over a family friend electrician, when I have a cheaper guy to do it (totally not listening to me).  He took me to Home Depot and threw 800.00 worth of things in my cart, insisting I would need it (yes they are all helpful items, but I just want to get theplace up to code first, and not get into debt).

I'm 16 years old and I recently bought a new desk and a new bookshelf and i want to paint my walls a different color. At the moment my walls look very dull, their  beige and I don't like it at all. I've never painted my room a different color but beige but I want to change it now. I'm really into bright colors like green and maybe orange and i reeally dislike purple, but i dont know what to choose.

My roommate is moving out this weekend and she gave her key to someone that I do not want to have access to my house. She is staying at her new place until this weekend when she comes to pick up her things. I want to make sure they don't come over without me being there. They can't get in the front door without me being there anyway because we have a chain lock on that door. I'll change the deadbolts after my roommate leaves. Should I just go ahead and change the locks since I will be here when she comes back? Or could I put a lock on the back porch door? The doorknob on my screen door on the front porch locks by pushing a little button on the handle. Does anyone still sell that kind of lock?

20090309114706AAq42Av	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Gardeners??? Is there a hedge that does well in shade?	Just moved into a new house. It has a good sized backyard, but we don't know what to do with it. There are several mature trees (about 13, not evergreen (I don't know what they are yet, there are no leaves as it's still winter)) back there. There are also tons of large rocks (I live in Connecticut, and this is common everywhere here) iceburging out there. I feel like a hedge would make the space more usable. Right now it just feels like a wooded lot between my house and the neighbor's. It doesn't feel like MY BACKYARD. Does anybody know of any type of hedge (or something that would work kind of like that (besides a fence)) that would do well in full or nearly full shade? I want to define my property line.      Or would I have better luck doing beds along the edge of my property, filled with plants that do well in the shade?      Any gardeners out there? I'm in hardiness zone 6-7 (06340).

20090309123257AAlspau	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Would this be the right way to clean my glass pipe/bowl/piece?	So I googled how to clean my pipe and the first site that comes up is from ehow and it says to:   First you place your dirty pipe in the plastic zip lock bag and drop about half a table spoon of salt in it. You might want to put more or less salt it all depends on the size of your pipe.      Step2   Second you get some hot water, preferably reaching a boiling point, and pour it carefully into the bag making sure the pipe is drowning in the water. Then pour 1/4 cup of rubbing alcohol. You then zip it up and give it a shake, dissolving the salt in the water. This process is basically getting the resin or sticky build up in your pipe to loosen up so it can easily be removed. Leave the bag sitting for a while, again it all depends on how much resin needs to be removed from your pipe. The more build up the longer the wait.      Step3   The next step is scrubbing that resin out with your pipe cleaner. There are three holes where you can access the inside of the pipe to remove the resin. The carb, the mouth piece, and the bowl. Run the pipe cleaner from all angles, through each one of the holes until all resin is completely removed. You might have to place pipe back in bag if youre having a difficult time removing the resin. You can always use more salt as a scrub. Once youve reached point of satisfaction you can rinse it out with lukewarm water, wipe it up, and then celebrate...       It sounds legit...but I want to make sure and see if anyone has tried this approach on cleaning your piece.

20090309175351AASEtJF	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	How far away does a piano need to be from a fireplace to avoid problems?	I have a great spot for a piano. The only problem is that it would be adjacent to a wall with a gas fireplace. As it stands now, the piano is approximately 3 feet away from the fireplace. The piano stands against a longer wall, about 2 feet from a wall that angles inward (forming a 45 degree angle), housing the chimney and fireplace.       It looks like this:                              |                              \   The piano is against the wall, near the angle.  The fireplace is on the wall after the angle.      I'm worried about the heat from the fireplace warping the piano or causing it to go out of tune.  Does this sound like that will happen? If so, the piano can be moved along that longer wall, away from the fireplace (approximately 5 more feet away).  Would this solve the problem?

I am purchasing my first home and the inspector told me to take the insulation out of the rafters in the ceiling of the crawl space and put it all along the foundation wall.   Currently the last guy put up the vapor barrier covering up the insulation right on the ceiling (which he told me to take down and put on the ground)   but this is a home build before 1950 and Im pretty sure its vented.   He didnt mention anything about sealing the vents, Im confused which way it should be insulated, since from searching online it looks like if your crawl is vented, you are to put insulation in the ceiling of the space      Help would be great!
