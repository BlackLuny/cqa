20090203071204AAtN5yR	Social Science;Psychology	Why do some people feel the need to create and seek out drama?	I'm all in favor of being friendly, and taking the time to stop and visit with others, whether it be at work or home or elsewhere.      What I don't understand though, is people who spend EVERY SINGLE MOMENT of their lives in a non-stop frenzy of gossipping and giggling and texting and hysterics and "he said she said" and blah blah blah. In some cases, they literally spend more time talking than breathing. I'm not kidding.      And they talk about the most meaningless things . . . every thought in their head is blurted out, no matter how trivial. It's like a twisted form of "thinking out loud", although, I don't think they actually think before they speak. "I'm hot. I'm cold. I like gum. Purple is a pretty color. I like shoes. I took a dump this morning, and it was in the shape of Elvis."      What is it with these people? Is it simply severe immaturity, or is it some sort of personality disorder?

20090220160608AAUfKGA	Social Science;Psychology	What do I do if I know there's something wrong with me mentally?	Like those criminals who can't feel compassion and that sort of thing? When we watch movies, most of us picture ourselves as the hero or heroin. But I don't do that any more. I see more eye to eye with the villain, the killer. It's why I don't watch horror movies; I'm afraid to see myself as them...      Anyway, the bigger problem is that lately I realized I don't care if someone dies. We watched a movie in one of my classes, and in the end someone got killed brutally. The guy deserved it, but one of the girls in that class kind of squealed and covered her mouth like it was that horrible, because the guy who did the killing was totally innocent, he was just trying to help. I could see everyone else there at least cared, they looked sad at the very least...      But I didn't. I didn't care that someone was killed, and I didn't care that someone so innocent had to be put away. I know that if I had to, I would kill someone no matter what they did, no matter what they deserved, and I wouldn't care.      The only thing that stops me is fear of what I will become, and fear of what I will lose in the prosses...      So my question to you is what do I do? Who am I supposed to turn to? How do I make myself feel again?

I'm sure if they have identical job titles and equal experience they are probably paid the same, because it would be too easy to sue the manager.  Also, if this were true, why wouldn't you only higher women.  Wouldn't you be making 21% more money? Wouldn't it just be dumb, economically speaking, to hire a man?      Is this stat flawed?

How far are they able to go, to what lengths will they go to,    to keep such relationships alive (no matter thin the ice is)?T What measures will they go to get to stay or just be with that guy?   How far is a woman able to go? Will they even be able to sacrafice others for it?

20090220102823AACM2Ev	Social Science;Psychology	My manager is impossible to read, doesn't seem to like anyone, can I improve work environment?	I'm a likeable person. I've met very few people who don't like me. I make a conscious effort to be personable, pleasant, happy. I've worked in customer service since I was 14 (I'm 22) so I've gotten pretty good at this. So this is a new situation for me. I just got a new job after waitressing for years as a cashier. One of my managers is a miserable old grump! He is very curt, barks at customers and employees alike. How he got into customer service is beyond me, but that's not the issue here. It's just his nature to be grumpy. I can't tell if he likes anyone, let alone me, but I've been hearing from customers (quite a few, actually) and other managers that he's especially rude to me. I'm not sure why this is, because I have been doing a very good job at work (I've been getting feedback from all other management, they're very happy with my performance) so he can't be grumpy about that. The only thing I can think of is maybe since I'm so cheerful all of the time it just grates on his opposite personality... ?   What's a good way to deal with working with someone who doesn't like you? I'm totally new to this situation, and it's pretty uncomfortable for me. I just don't like it if I think someone's unhappy with me. Should i continue to be so upbeat around him, or just try not to engage him in conversation anymore? It's just the two of us, so when it's slow it's awkward to just stand there and not talk.

20090220103236AAtsZSe	Social Science;Psychology	I dreamed of leaving pillows on a dirty road only to find an ancient truth at the end. What does this mean?	It began with me walking down a road. It was sunny out but everyone had thrown away all of their garbage out on the ends of their driveways. A lot of their garbage included old furniture.      Now here comes the weird part. Every now and then there would be a large, dead hog laying on it's side at the end of some of the houses. I remember feeling gross and I had pillows with me. I knew I had been instructed to lay the pillows down on the road wherever there was a dead hog that didn't have one.      After slowly walking down this road I come across one trash pile that has a desk in it. On this polished wooden desk I can hear an old woman speaking in my mind, "Make sure you give this to Ella. It's meant for her to have." I see on the desk that there are two beige books with gold trim and "Ella" engraved in gold on the top right corners. I also see three golden instruments on the desk. I'm not sure what they are but they have long stems with wand like figures on the heads.      I take the books and walk into the house's garage to read them (it's dimmer in the garage). At first it just appears to be a Bible. Then I see each book is describing a sister. I forget what the first sister is called, but I specifically reading about "The Beautiful Sister" in the second book. It shows descriptions of "The Beautiful Sister" and lists tons of secrets and things that don't exactly make too much sense to me.      The books are divided into three parts: the what, the why, and the how.      Then I wake up.      What is up in my sub-conscious??

20090220111836AA6Imab	Social Science;Psychology	Ever felt you've made a huge mistake while making an impression?	Well, i basically messed up the whole lecture by my negative thinking in class. It didn't went as I expected at all. This however was a huge mistake for me, since the people I talked to didn't know me that well. Right now I feel somewhat ashamed because Im sure the'll have a wrong idea about me. I told things about me and my life that I basically didn't mean. I feel really bad about this. Because some of the things i told, was certainly important good things for me and I made the sound like they where bad to me.      I mean, i don't feel bad because I was talking too stressed. But just this feeling, when you feel like you haven't act like yourself. When you don't feel like yourself. i take really hard on it, to not be myself  >__>

20090220103501AAfrJUD	Social Science;Psychology	How common is sexual transference in therapy?	I'm female and have been seeing my male therapist for 2-1/2 years now.  I don't believe I have sexual feelings for him, but recently he's been leading the discussion there and he thinks that I'm in denial about this, as (he says) sexual transference is very common.  I think his intentions are pure (i.e; I highly doubt he would try anything physical, or contact me out of session, etc), he's just very Freudian.   That said, I'm growing uncomfortable with his recent persistence on the issue and am thinking of terminating therapy with him.  I've come to view him as a parental figure, not a sexual one, and it makes me sad and sick to think of him any other way.  So, I guess what I'm asking is, am I over-reacting?

20081110155620AAuNowz	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I have been having dreams that I am being stalked. I have never been stalked before, nor do i wish to, however?	the dreams happen right before I wake up. The 1st happened the morning of my 21st Birthday Dayhday day Party, and I got a note that said "To my darling, my love, my partner" I freaked out, and I must have known who it was, because I wanted to go to the cops. I was crying and freaking out, and I had a feeling I knew who it was. There is a guy who lives 2 door p that is strange. One day, when I had my horse down the front, he slowed right down and stopped, reversed and started at me. He does that, just stares at me. I woke up feeling really sick. The next night (these dreams happen right before I wake up) I had a dream, but it was the day of my party, and one of my freinds handed me a gift, we assumed it was from a friend, but when i opened the card, it read "To my darling, my love" I was scared, and said, "Its him" I remember the present being the same as one I actually got, wrapping, and shape and item. A Mother of pearl photo frame with a butterfly on one corner. However it didn't have a photo of anyone in it. I was about to read the rest of the card when I woke up, I was terrified.   Last night, (teh third night of dreams) i slept for aboout 4 hours and woke up wanting a drink. I drank and couldn't get to sleep. I thought someone was outside, so I read, and I probably was going paranoid. I stayed up reading (2 books) until sunrise) and then decided to sleep. I woke up another 3 hours later. 5 months ago my beloved friend, (horse) of almost 10 years had to be put down. I have just come out of a wave of sad emotions that last about a week. I have dreamt of him (Buddy) twice,but this was different. It was a stalker. Help!! Im am scared to sleep, because it felt so real, and It was really scary.

To the point where I would be fake to get one's approvel. I used to get so upset if i messed up a simple comversation, and some may have looked at me weird that I'd cry for 2 hours straight. I also hate the way I look, I used to care so much, i'd spend two hours getting ready, until i thought i looked okay to exit my house.I'm extremely skinny, about 95 pounds and 5 something. People constantly ask me if i have like aa tape worm, or they'll give me some of there lunch, it's insulting, and i feel like crap 24/7. I eat alot but never gain, and i have social anxiety, and everything in my life is so overwhleming that about a year ago i just gave up. I don't get into detail with someone, because i feel it's a lost cause. My mind used to be so filled with plans, and happiness, and i had tooonnns of friends. I was just the best. Then i realized i'm less than everyone else, i'm ugly, i'm an eyesore, i felt retarted when i spoke, and i just gave up. My mind isn't running everywhere, and fun like it used to be, i haven't laughed in two years, I just feel like i'm wasting my life away. When i talk to people i try to be myself, but then when i try my words come out rehearsed, and i end up not being myself because i try to hard. I hate everything i have become and i'm simply 15.

Why do we have such an archaic, barbaric, law still active?      Alimony was originally created because the wife becomes the man's property when he marries her.  And even when divorced, he is supposed to take care of his property.        Now, that's all fine and dandy IF women were actually considered property.  Feminism has done away with such a notion, but what have they done to get rid of the law based on it?  Nothing?  Is this because the beneficial side of this mostly applies to women?      If women are so equal, why can't they earn their own money.  Does a divorce render the female human inept?  Surely, that can't be true.  I was taught they women were just as capable as men.      Was I wrong?  Why do we have alimony anymore?

From time to time, I run into people who talk about how there ought to be more social programs for low income workers.  Why is that?  Those people earn low wages for a reason.  Blue collar workers don't make enough contributions to society.  I think it's absurd that blue collar workers expect to have health care for a family of 4.  Instead of complaining to the government, why don't they reinvent themselves so that they are competitive?  Why don't blue collar workers do that instead of expecting the government to pay them benefits since they weren't ambitious enough to get a better education?

20090220120640AAdMzS5	Social Science;Psychology	Is there any Psychological Diagnostics for this?	It has to do with Psychology.      I have this problem. I am usually always alarmed. I always feel like I have done something really bad. I always feel like I have offended someone or done something that can ruin someone's life in the future.I am always worrying about something, even things I cannot control. I feel like things I have done in the past will come back to hunt me. Its almost like I am paranoid.  I am 18.         Is there any Psychological Diagnostics for this?
20090203075308AAhtaHA	Social Science;Psychology	Does this sound obsessive to you?	Okay, so I'm almost 16. I've been lifting weights that weight 5kg each every night since I was 14 for at least an hour and use a chest expander and those things you push in you hands to make your fingers and lower arms stronger every night. And since Autumn I went on a twist stepper every night and since boxing day been going on my new exercise bike every night for at least two hours on 4th gear.       I keep it balanced I think, don't increase my bike level or weight mass to prevent going too big too young to stop my growth getting deformed. But when other people, including a science teacher who used to be a police officer see my bare arms on none-uniform day, they say I'm huge and some comment I must have a problem to do this. I don't know what to think, I personally don't think I'm that muscular but everyone else does. Does it sound too much to you?

20090220165049AAqJ4Es	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What character traits used to be considered more masculine than feminine but aren't any more?	For example, years ago if a woman was assertive, that would be seen as a masculine, not a feminine, characteristic. Women who were too assertive were told they needed to back off and act more like a lady. With the strides made by feminism in the modern era, assertiveness seems no longer to be a gender-distinctive characteristic.      What other character traits used to be considered masculine, but are now considered neither masculine nor feminine?

For the year 1972, GDP for the United States was approximately $1170 billion. for   1979, it was approximately $2370 billion, slightly more than double the 1972 figure.         a. Why might it be incorrect to infer that the real yearly output of the United States has more than doubled?       b. Suggest additional reasons why the average person in the United States might not have been twice as “well off” in 1979 as in 1972.
20090203074611AAyojd5	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Weird Dreams About Crush? Are These Bad Signs?	I have a crush on some kid called Chris that's in one of my classes at school. We're both 16.    We're not even friends, really. I've barely spoken to him. But he's hot, and even more attractively.. he's got a chillax, and unique personality, he's smart.. which is what drives me crazy over him.    I've had this crush for about two months now. In December '08, I had a dream he beat me up against a vending machine (WTF)..    But more recently, as I think my crush got deeper, I dreamt we were kinda friends... it's just all random.     I don't think I've had such a powerful crush before, and I'm 16.    Answers appreciated, thanks!
20090203075007AANYEiJ	Social Science;Psychology	What do you think this dream means?	okay, so it was sort or religious i guess..which is weird bc im not a really religious person. like i believe in god and stuff though.         okay so what i remember is   i was in a CCD class (church school, which i actually did have to go to one 2 days ago.) back to the dream : but the class was all little kids, and one older kid. we were there for like 6 hours it seemed like, it was only supposed to last like 2, but strangely when they said class was over and i could leave, i wanted to stay. i dont remember like what the teacher was saying or what we were learning..   but i remember going to the back of the room and a little kid handing me an old book, and there was a section that was all pictures that people felt were signs of god i guess, like for example: freckles on someones arm resembling jesus. or like a scar that looked like a cross.   then (still in the dream) i looked at the wall and there was some clear tape in it, and when i turned my head i could see the shine coming off of the tape, and it looked like a man(jesus i guess) carrying a cross on his back..then i left the classroom.   then i woke up.     idk i felt kinda freaked out because it was so like, vivid and sort or religious. what do you think it means?

20090203075430AAvo4ju	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream interpretation?	I had a dream that I had a lot of nice things so organized/ in a house.  My son needed help with homework so I found all these rulers lined up in a case and took out the one he need, the metric one.  Then I went outside and told another son to come out of a go cart that looked Barbie,.  My kids had wonderful toys and things for playing. THe backyard was filled with fun things, out of the ordinary.   I saw that we were selling the house and the back had a big deck with outdoor furniture that was made of glass.  The was a female older buyer and I told her "You like my houses!"  because she bought another house I sold.  I saw my kids had their own luggage, matching their personalities, and they were beautiful luggages.  Then a older man in the deck said to me, "I dont understand this house" and brought me to a room.  It looked like the room evolved from a former garage to an entertainment room (It was painted over in white,it was under more scutiny the details of a room that had a stereo, lights a/c like a disco)   The laundry room had two sets of washer/dryer.  and she said to me she likes the washer (like it was important to her)

WEll they really aren't that big but i feel like i'm so stupid. i used to be involved in school and actually try my best in every assignment but now i'm doing everything half-heartedly. i'm starting to feel like some failure and i suck at everything i do. every single goal i had in my mind i quit halfway. i don't do any sports and i have a weird sense of handling my problems. sometimes i feel like if i'm not really living. that's what i  feel. my only escape is the internet. i wear weird clothes i have no sense of style and my hair is always messy i really don't care how i look but i guess there's a line.. i ignore that line and i look like a total mess. i have low self-esteem or is it really that? i have no idea. i'm just wondering around.. my goals my dreams.. i don't even have the will power within me to go after them. it's like they're flying away. i'm a retarded apathetic person. that's what i am. or describe myself. tha'ts what i am!  i don't want to be that way....... I SUCK! my parents within them think i'm some retarded failure... i didn't go to the school they wanted me to go. that's because i was too scared to go to suuch school. i begged my mom to get me out of there.. i can't cry at   all. is everything bottled up inside me/? i don't feel it at all. i'm such a dummy.. i want to be better than this.

20090203080503AA0hb3U	Social Science;Psychology	Do you think tattooing your arms is a deterrent to self-mutilation?	I have been cutting and burning my arms since I was 13 years old and I am now 31 years old. I go through spurts of hurting myself and then I'll stop for a while. When I self-mutilate it calms me down. I'm also afraid of losing control and it helps me not to. I'm bipolar and it helps me get through some of my moods. However, I've decided to try to stop permanently. I'm afraid that when my kids get older they will pick up on it and so that's my biggest reason for wanting to stop. So I got one forearm tattooed the other day. I can't see ruining the tattoo so I will leave it alone. I plan on getting the other arm tattooed as well. Do you think I will stop hurting myself or will I start hurting myself on other parts of my body or in other ways?

20090220165557AAXHDsI	Social Science;Psychology	Imagination to reality... Help!!?	Okay.. You know people.. always imagine things but they are still stuck to reality... But in my case I imagine things, right, and for no apparent reason things came to be as it is but in a different way.. For instance also, when things were done and I was not satisfied with it.. I imagine that scene was to be of my will... but it's over then the results of the scenes were with my accordance.. and I knew it was my imagination... And I think I can use my imagination to create or distort reality.. But somehow I think... because of imagination... I developed a mental illness.. it seems that I am depersonalized or it seems that time just passes by with no meaningful thing or work I've done.. I've been doing things lately that makes me busy and of my interest, but somehow I worked but I feel no truthfulness in my work.. So I was thinking it could be my imagination that hinders me to reality...      PLease.. would I stop imagining.. but not really imagine that I will lose control just a fantasy though.. not long imagination just some minutes or seconds...       Did this happen to someone??
