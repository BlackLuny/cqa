It matters not a whit, now they are here but to know that their own Mum chose to resort to deception to create them may create identity issues of the most complex kind.|`|QAEQqgzyaa	I think she is really selfish and shows blatant disregard for her children and for their fathers. As for the fact that she is planning on telling the children exactly how they came to be is despicable and I personally think she must have a screw loose. I think that social services should keep an eye on her for her children's sake.|`|Zq3fkJmEaa	my heart goes out to what this young lady has suffered. i am recovering from a childhood full of rejection and abuse, and i know how strong the need for love is, but this is a bad way to deal. therapy will probably help, and forming strong relationships with other adults, rather than just using men to get what she wants.|`|qRJztNNZaa	i think if one parent is divorced and they have the kids it will become useful as they grow and maybe teach them to make right choices but i also think that it may effect a child negatively if they dont have that other role model whether its a parent, aunt/uncle or teacher. :) ~:>|`|ZHGMLPhuaa	No way is that good!!!

And how often does the pill really fail? My sister-in -law used this excuse to trap my husbands brother when they were teenagers. But then he should have used a more follproff method of contraception.<br>  <br>  But anyway, this woman is lucky that she has a new rich partner. Would single-motherhood have been so good in a council flat in some run-down estate? <br>  <br>  And the way her daughter is posing for the camera is the most sickening thing of all.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	She's a seriously f***ed up and selfish con merchant, and sadly her kids will pay the price for that in the end. It's nowhere near what I'd call responsible parenthood - it's probably a difficult concept for this lying c**t to grasp, but that would involve actually being HONEST with the person you intend to conceive a child with.<br>  <br>  I feel sorry for the blokes that she conned and tricked into becoming dads, although in a way it's their own fault for not using a condom with someone they hadn't got to know properly first. It's stories like this that will increase demand for the Male Pill.|`|avhgLEu8aa	That's totally wrong. She should have the kids taken off her.|`|S8RL9lieaa	Hi Kat, are you sure this womans name isn't Hate as opposed to Harte. So wrapped up in her own best interest that she would tell her children that "oh by the way, I pulled this bloke in a bar and that's how you were made".

She needs shot with ****!|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	what a selfish woman, her only thoughts are for herself. she might think its ok and shes a good mum, but how do some of the kids feel knowing there dads want nothing to do with them ,i dont care what anyone says thats got to hurt.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	The woman is trash. Children need a father and a mother when growing up and for her to do this deliberately is so irresponsible it's pathetic.|`|wSc7ZdBCaa	I think this woman (?) and the one who recently had 8 babies are in the same category. Irresponsible!!! Self-centered!!!   A terrible role model (example) for any young female. <br>  <br>  If it's true a picture's worth a thousand words...then the pictures of her with her children show all of the above. In addition, the oldest two children (girls) by their pose = seem to "look" like their mother and have "learned" her attitude.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it's hard to imagine a positive future for any of them (adult or child).|`|50lIaC8zaa	Well shes a great role model for her daughters isn't she!!?<br>  <br>  I don't think its fair what she did and because of it her first daughter will probably never know her dad. People should have the right to choose if and when they want to have children, not have it forced upon them because its what someone else wants, she is very devious and very wrong!|`|ezT7xruoaa	I think when you decide to have sex with a woman, you accept responsibility for your actions. If the guy relies on her taking the pill its his own fault! Even if she did take the pill there is always a chance of pregnancy because of illness, diarrhoea, etc. <br>  <br>  So I think if the guys fall for it, its their own fault. If you don't want a baby use a condom!!!|`|iKmkRaqBaa	At least one loving parent is not wrong because in many places father is a dummy.<br>  Life is not in our hands .

A married guy with a family of his own.  She has destroyed this man's life.  What a *****!  I think it's so wrong to make someone an unwitting sperm-donor.|`|LPO8RlVdaa	No, this slapper was absolutely decietful and wrong, and in my opinion should even be jailed for her actions. <br>  <br>  This raises quite a few issues for me here. First and foremost is the fact that once again a woman thinks it is her absolute right to have children and the men involved have absolutely no choice whatsoever in wether or not a child is brought into there lives. From the initial decision of wether the child is kept, wether he gets to see the child or not, or wether or not the CSA will come along and ruin his life, the man has absolutely no rights anymore and it is sickening. <br>  <br>  And coco and jezabel (name says it all) there are a lot of women out there who diliberately trick and mislead men into getting them pregnant. If I say had an STI or AIDS and deliberately misled you by saying I didn't and then had sex with you could I get away with saying <br>  oh well it was your own fault for having sex with me? I don't think so!!! There was a recent court case were a man was jailed for deliberately going round and having sex with women and infecting them with AIDS. Is that the womens fault for having sex with him? Dont be so stupid. This woman should face legal consequences too.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I believe that children need strong feminine and masculine influences in their lives as they grow up. Too much of one or the other and that inevitably leads to problems. This is already a huge problem in society, yet left wing idiocy keeps on apologising and pussy footing round women like this. It truly disgusts me.
AA11358806	Ummm, this is what we call a loaded question. However, I will try to answer it anyway. These things are best settled by diplomats, not soldiers. The political leaders will stop the armies they control when there is a solution in place that most of the parties involved can live with. The sooner it happens, the fewer dead people there will be. I don't pretend to have the solution, and it is not for me (an American) to impose one.|`|AA10016396	There's no such thing as an innocent Palestinian|`|AA12218378	I really hope UN will start doing something about it,not just say that they will take measures about that and then doing nothing.But right now it seems no one is doing anything.'Cos as long as Palestinians are dieing it's OK for everyone.'Cos if they are Palestinians ,as far as the international community is concerned,they're by definition terrorists,so Israel is acting in "self defense".No matter who they kill.|`|53621a1af7e1c7c9776e6f4aadeac231aa	There's nothing innocent about Palestinians when you watch the news media - there daily attacking, abusing, rioting & sourcing every conceivable crime going.

The advert may depict a man getting all the girls (like the lynx advert) but no-one believes that and it is not designed that they should but it does play on the base fears I have previously mentioned.<br>  <br>  All advertising plays on fears, the fear of not having and being labelled poor, the fear of being single and being labelled as smelly or a virgin or unclean. Fear is also used to sell newspapers and certain programmes. I have lost track of the amount of thwarted terrorist threats that have been reported in sensational fashion only to be later denied or disappear into nothing. Often these stories are just nonsense with the source being nothing more than "a high ranking official" or "a source close to the Home Office". Bollocks is it. Does anyone remember the classic Sun newspaper story about how Al Qaeda was going to kill us with Riccin? Just 5ml of Riccin could kill thousands of people, blah, blah, blah. They even showed us how Al Qaeda was going to use umbrellas to stab people to get the riccin in to the bloodstream. Ha, ha, yeah, okay. I myself laughed at the preposterous notion but it sold newspapers and for days any Muslim with an umbrella was a potential terrorist looking to stab you with riccin. Maybe if there had been an army of 500,000 I would have been more convinced.<br>  <br>  PR as you put it is spin doctoring. It is putting a gloss or sheen on something to make it better than it is. My way of unstripping the PR is to ask "what are they not telling me?” I also apply this to the news and newspapers. Recent PR which is a good example of how misleading and corrupt it can be is of course the complete and utter lies spouted by the British and American Governments with reference to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the over hyping of the terrorist threat to increase their ability to control dissent through the Patriot Act in America and the Glorifying of Terrorism legislation that we now have in Britain.<br>  <br>  It is interesting that you claim to ignore the media because you don't wish to be affected by PR. We are all guilty of PR my friend. The clothes you choose to wear on a daily basis represent they way you wish others to perceive you. As such you make those choices based upon how you believe (consciously or not) people will respond to your appearance etc. Would you go to a job interview wearing a hoody and baggy jeans with your **** hanging out the back of them? Probably not! That's not the image you wish to present. That is your PR.<br>  <br>  Based upon your comment I will add to my post. You make reference to the point that people say a film is "awesome" because it got 5 stars in the Sun or people like a song because its number 1 rather than liking the song originally. This is what I mean by the use of fear by the media to control and how it is a very useful tool of capitalism to stimulate consumerism. The idea that people have a positive response to an "awesome" film is very much as you say, because other people have called it "awesome". <br>  <br>  The two examples are both based upon pop culture which often falls into the category of youth. Their reactions in reinforcing the "beliefs" of their peers is due to fear. We have all been to school and it doesn't take much thinking to understand the concept of what would happen to the child that said "it wasn't awesome, it stunk to high heaven". He/she would immediately be ostracised and uncool. Does the child in this case make a deliberate choice to avoid being uncool? No! The fear it plays on is a base fear, the same fear that I mentioned when referring to the deodorant advert, the fear of being lonely, excluded, alienated. The positives are used to subconsciously agitate the negatives.<br>  <br>  Regarding SuperRuper's answer I would like to point out that "critical analysis" is a skill and requires an understanding of the subject to be analysed. Most people do not understand the workings of the media or the way in which it controls, manipulates or mis-informs to promote itself and very often those that can legislate against it or advertise on it. The Encoding/Decoding model by Stuart Hall is the minimum required knowledge for people wanting to critically analyse. I would also like to point out that the media likes to "dumb down" TV in order to stop people critically analysing its output.<br>  <br>  Another factor required to critically analyse is as SuperRuper mentioned the requirement to view the other side of the argument. This is becoming more and more difficult as the mainstream news output very often perpetuates the dominant, hegemonic ideological belief of the society of its viewers. In the case of most people writing and reading the responses on this thread that will be a capitalist ideology. Without the "other" (other is often a term for them or those, my examples earlier referred to alienated or marginalised, therefore in media terms the "other" point of view is one that attempts to go against the hegemonic ideology. I.e. if it’s not capitalist then it must be communist (never simply socialist)) point of view be readily available people cannot necessarily make the critical analysis. The internet does offer people the opportunity to find this information, however, it still requires that they go against the dominant hegemonic belief system of their society and become the "other". They represent a marginalised belief, something different and as I have pointed out people are in general scared of being marginalised or different because the media plays on this fear.|`|56a2c12d6cc205a92eb64ece9ccda3b4aa	The media, today, provides a valuable service for those who wish to have meaningful insight and understanding of our world.  Because of the bias demonstrated on every channel, station, paper, magazine and radio program, we are forced to dig deep ourselves - to critically analyze everything we see, read and hear.  <br>  <br>  We can allow the media to control us, or we can regard it as it really is - just another viewpoint.  Some we agree with, and others we don't.  To blame the media for anything is to suggest that it has power over us and we've given up our ability to think for ourselves...|`|TZeqlaIJaa	20 years ago P.R was in full swing.  Thatchers government was one of the first to use the so called Spin Doctors and her clever use of the advertising machine that was Saatchi & Saatchi.<br>  <br>  I totally agree about the influence that one editor can have though and the case of Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross at the moment is a classic example of media influence.  The show itself during it's airing actually only received 2 complaints, yet after the headlines it's received it's now up to over 18,000. <br>  <br>  I can only think that the politicians are sticking their tuppenceworth in to divert the public's attention away from the real headlines like Afghanistan, Iraq and our looming recession.<br>  <br>  Good for you for deciding to not go with the flow!  If more of us made up our own minds and didn't buy into media hype we'd maybe have better role models for our kids instead of the likes of Jodie Marsh.|`|AA10065077	The media influences because people believe what they are told and most of the time the media makes something sound more incredible or bad than what it really is just to sell or get ratings. In the last 20 years the media has always had a major place in elections. Well, longer because of the Vietnam war. My mom still remembers watching the first news broadcast during the Vietnam war. They showed what appeared to be an American POW walking out with his handcuffed behind his back and two of his captors following him with guns pointed. They took him to the South Vietnamese and then walked away. A solider questioned the American briefly and then shot him in the head. Up to this point everyone knew war was bad, but they didn't know exactly what went on. The people only knew what the government wanted them to know. Now, for the first time people got to see first hand what was really happening. If it wasn't for the media during this time, the rioting probably would not have happened.|`|883b65d211900a099aaace84fb1fb83faa	My views on the media are the same as Noam Chomsky.

p2BMuSf9aa	Essere al verde è un modo di dire tipico della lingua italiana colloquiale, ma anche letteraria, che significa "rimanere senza un soldo". L'espressione è diffusissima, ma l'origine è sconosciuta ai più.Sull'origine dell'espressione esistono differenti teorie: nella maggior parte dei casi si tratta di pseudoetimologie, a volte nate in contesti locali.<br>  <br>  Nelle sue Note al Malmantile riacquistato (1688), Paolo Minucci ricorda come nelle aste pubbliche del Magistrato del Sale di Firenze si adoperassero, come 'segnatempo', delle lunghe candele di sego tinte di verde nell'estremità inferiore: quando la candela arrivava "al verde", l'asta si chiudeva. Da qui era nata l'espressione la candela è al verde, per indicare che il tempo era finito, ma anche essere al verde di denari, che in seguito nell'uso comune si è contratta nell'attuale essere al verde. <br>  Secondo un'altra teoria, l'espressione deriverebbe da un'usanza medievale che prevedeva l'accensione di una lanterna verde quando era pronto il cibo per una speciale categoria di poveri, i "vergognosi", coloro cioè che non erano nati poveri ma che lo erano diventati e che per questo motivo non si adattavano alla questua "normale". Questa usanza permetteva loro di entrare nell'ente caritatevole in silenzio, senza bussare, con minori probabilità di essere visti. <br>  Solamente i poveri non avevano i soldi per comperare una candela nuova quando essa era finita, cosicché la utilizzavano fino alla base, che, un tempo, era sempre di color verde. <br>  Altri studi hanno ipotizzato che il modo di dire derivi da un'antica usanza medievale, che consisteva nel far portare un berretto verde ai falliti in segno di pubblico scherno. <br>  A Padova si dà per certa l'origine della frase dalla sala verde dell'antico Caffè Pedrocchi, dove per antica tradizione chiunque può accomodarsi senza consumare. <br>  Altri sostengono che l'espressione sia nata nelle case da gioco. Il giocatore che ha perso tutte le sue fiches quando guarda il punto dove teneva il proprio gruzzoletto vede solo il tavolo da gioco, tradizionalmente verde.|`|yRc55JVdaa	bravo maggio... wow.... wikipedia forever!!<br>  .. se mi dici quando è il tuo compleanno... forse riesco a procurarmi una maglietta con scritto: I LOVE WIKIPEDIA...!<br>  poi così te la mando...:D:D<br>  <br>  cosa non si farebbe per avere 10punti su yahoo answers!!<br>  :D:D|`|84zDuvOfaa	Bo, sai me lo  sono sempre chiesta anche io..!

The price of crude dropped because the downturn in the economy forced speculators to stop investing in it and articificially driving up the price AND consumption, at least in America, is waaaay down. Whether it will stay that way will depend on whether we resume our wasteful driving habits once the price is down AND whether OPEC implements significant cuts in production to drive the price of crude back up.|`|9dEotvVwaa	Mainly because the price of crude is down about 60%, and consumption is down by about 6%.

I always said that the second my man raised a hand to me I would kick him in the nuts and run off.<br>  <br>  Well I stayed with a partner after countless times like the above and more.  I ended up in a refuge unable to tell my friends or family where I was and I still went back until something just clicked in me and I knew he was going to kill me one day.<br>  <br>  No one hits you on a first date, it is done after many months of this partner playing games with you, first of all making you feel like you are made out of gold and then slowing chipping away at your self confidence and esteem until you think this is all you are worth and you do everything you can not to upset them, but the goal posts always change.  <br>  <br>  I thought I was stupid for staying but there are so many men and women who despite being clever, funny and wonderful people are caught up in these relationships.<br>  <br>  Rhianna might be beautiful and she may be talented but no one knows what this man has been saying and doing to her in private for the past couple of years.  <br>  <br>  All I can say is good luck to her and hopefully she will open her eyes soon.|`|iYsGaDbFaa	Once is definately enough, but Rihanna stated in her police report that it was escalating violence.

She needs to realized that he′s a woman beater, not likely to change.

They are living very different lives from the average joe and I think Chris is finding it harder to cope with all the money, fame, women throwing themselves at him and power. <br>  He has people on his staff that are twice his age, imagine all that power in a teenagers hands. <br>  <br>  It seems crazy because she has her own money, career and fame but she is desperately in love and Chris Brown appears to be a very charismatic guy who is very good looking and she does not want anyone else to have him. <br>  <br>  She is also very insecure, she said she was bullied at school and that makes sense because there usually is abuse in the victim and abusers past. <br>  <br>  There is more to this story that they are not revealing, it is not cut and dry and I think we will never know what that is. <br>  <br>  Chris didn't need to be in a serious relationship, he is too young. <br>  <br>  He is 19 going on 14 and that's actually when his career started. Most 19 years old are at college, playing computer games and hanging out with friends, they either have a saturday job or beg their parents for pocket money BUT Chris is the one out making money and paying the mortgage. <br>  <br>  It is not our business to tell them what to do but they would be much better apart. This relationship is toxic and without boundaries.|`|RTx1D48paa	A long time ago I had much the same feelings as you.....In fact I spent an hour trying to convince a woman to leave an abusive boyfriend.....<br>  <br>  THEN I watch them together one night at a local club..... She PROKED HIM......she deliberately tried to get him to hit her or fight someone else over her.... somewhere in her childhood she had gotten violence confused with love.....<br>  <br>  In another incident I met a beautiful folksinger in a club in Helena Montana......we went out to dinner.....I spent the evening trying to convince her that I was a gentle considerate passionate lover.....while she spent the evening telling me about every violent man in her history.....I suddenly was aware she was attracted to me because I looked "violent'......she wanted to be beaten..... I decided it was NOT the kind of relationship I wanted.....later she introduced me to her new lover..... a big rough tough Hells Angel type biker..... her message was "you may not want it but he does".....I wish them both luck<br>  <br>  Not all of these violent relationships are this way.....some women simply think "he will change" ( truth is they never do.....and it usually gets worse not better)..... but I have come to a conclusion......and that conclusion explains why women get involved with married men (if he cheats on his wife; he will cheat on his mistress)<br>  <br>  The conclusion??..... If a man can make that little thing down there "feel good".....her brain stops functioning..... it is only when that little thing down there stops feeling good she dumps him...... until then she will put up with almost anything|`|52pZj3WFaa	My sentiments exactly. If he could do it once he can do it again and next time there won't be the sympathy. She's in a position (financially, anyway) to tell him to f*ck right off, so why didn't she?<br>  <br>  Is she that desperate for reassurance that she gets her self-esteem from a man who beats a woman when he doesn't share her opinion?|`|E8rPB1CBaa	It's all hype.

The two of them obviously have a love-hate relationship, and I suspect that Rihanna has some sort of dependency on Chris Brown.  She might be very insecure and anxious behind her show business exterior.  The same can be said about her attacker.  It is shocking when one considers how young both of them really are.  They are two stars who have risen very rapidly.  I think that people who grow up too quickly and have had the experiences that mainly people must older than they are have had, often tend to be insecure in a lot of ways.<br>  <br>  Maybe Rihanna has to mature.  It has been said that hindsight is always better, and maybe some day she will see the truth of the matter.<br>  <br>  I posted a similar question on Yahoo!

However<br>  with that said, some women still want to pursue the relationship and<br>  they have to have more beatings before they change, if they do, and<br>  the only problem is it may be their last, as a lot of physical abuses<br>  end up to where the abuser is dead.

Men (and women-let's not forget, women can be very violent, too) like this are insecure bullies whose insecurities turn them into monsters. People often stay with abusive partners, because they feel it was a "one off", or because the perpetrator says they are sorry. Eventually, the victim becomes so worn down, they are often too scared to leave.  The case of Chris Brown and Rhianna just highlights that this type of sickness is not choosy-it can seep into anybody's life, regardless of their status.  I think she is either very brave or very foolish-my money is on the latter.|`|DEglvDGDaa	sorry skiddo sounds harsh but she is a bloody idiot ad no excuse either<br>  <br>  a lot of women are trapped and still make the break. she is setting a really bad example to all.<br>  <br>  message goes out it is ok to hit a woman cos she will come back and forgive and forget<br>  <br>  people need to realise that it is harder for a guy to do it a the first time every other time it happens it gets easier for them<br>  <br>  once is enough<br>  <br>  <br>  I am a great believer in the zero tolerance to domestic abuse|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Once is more than enough!<br>  <br>  This happens to young women every day in our country.

I have never encountered anything like the emotional abuse this man subjects his wife to.

When I don't know about a situation that much, I look to the media, which I really shouldn't. That's why everybody is so pro-israel because they just do not know. Israel depends on the US and basically is on US welfare, if the US stops giving billions of dollars a year to them, being controlled by them (in both their governments, media, and show biz), Israel would just fall apart. We give them everything. I was watching C-Span and the Israeli prime minister Livini, was giving the american media a press conference. One reporter called her country out for blockading Gaza, including Egypt, and that the people could either die like animals or attack, the guy next to her wouldn't let him speak and turned off his microphone, that's how bad the Israelis do not want the american people to know about their genocide. I must call out that there are orthodox jews protesting Nazi Israel's actions and I applaud them for doing that.|`|ymXlF9Rnaa	A bunch of pro-Hamas communist anarchists attacking their own police, most anti-Israel protests are full of violent hooded men.<br>  <br>  Read this: <a href="http://tedekeroth.wordpress.com/2009/02/08/arabs-throws-pipebombs-and-fires-rockets-on-peacful-pro-israeli-demonstration/" rel="nofollow">http://tedekeroth.wordpress.com/2009/02/...</a>|`|rIlpqCzmaa	great. israel kills civilians|`|AS4pWko5aa	i don't <br>  <br>  maybe if they lived with rockets being fired at them and having children too sacred to go out they might think again about protesting <br>  what about the suicide attacks , the swedish people have no idea what is going on there are two sides to the story<br>  muslims also live in israel , only 50% of the people in israel are jewish you need to do some research and have more knowledge on the subject before you ask questions and answer|`|8cLV2OPYaa	First of all it isn't "Swedish". It is a bunch of extremist, anti-Israel, muslim fanatics and their sympathizers that happen to LIVE in Sweden. Get it right. Next, if any of those muslims in Sweden who feel it is their solemn duty to protest Israel ACTUALLY had any real love for their own Palestinian brothers and sisters, they would go there and help them instead of shooting their mouths off. But since, they only really hate Israel, and could care less if Palestinians actually have freedom or not, they just run the streets wherever they live railing against Israel.<br>  <br>  It is disgusting if you ask me. Palestinians have had many several opportunities to enjoy peace with Israel and they have rejected every single one. Also, that land they currently live on was never theirs to begin with if you read history, so they have no real legitimate claim to it anyways. They refuse to share their communities with Israelis, they insist of firing rockets into the Israeli territory, and they use their waterfront (when it wasn't blockaded) to bring in weapons and explosives, rather than to initiate any kind of legitimate trade with anyone else in the world.<br>  <br>  Now that is the EXACT truth of the matter whether you or anyone else likes it or not. If you wish to support Palestinians and their tactics that's all well and good, but let's not pretend who we are dealing with here. The prisoners are in charge of the prison, so to speak, in the Gaza strip. As long as you have people bent on war in charge there, that is exactly what they are going to get. Israel is a far more powerful people than the Palestinians, it is common sense that if the Palestinians had competent leadership, they would attempt to get along with Israel rather than baiting and daring them constantly to roll in and crush them utterly, which, by the way, will eventually happen at some point if the Palestinians aren't careful.<br>  <br>  So if you TRULY support the Palestinian people, I would suggest to you that instead of rallying against Israel, I would protest the militant extremists that keep the Palestinians under a constant state lock down and war, by refusing to cease hostilities with Israel. Israel will do whatever it feels it needs to do to defend it's citizens, right, wrong, or indifferent. Since that fact can be absolutely counted on, it makes absolutely no logical sense whatsoever to insist on forcing Israel to continue to defend itself. The Palestinians need to get control of their own people, and lock up the ones who insist on firing weapons at Israel or commit any other crime. Every other nation on earth has a police force, except Somalia, why can't the Palestinians control their own criminal element?<br>  <br>  What do you think would happen if we here in America had roving gangs of well armed thugs firing rockets into Mexico? We would have them put down, rounded up, shipped off the jail, and standing before a judge before you could even say the word genocide. Palestinians will never enjoy the responsibility of being viewed as a legitimate sovereign entity, until they figure out how to control their own people. Until then, lets drop all the foolish propaganda against Israel. Anyone, and I mean ANYONE who has been there, knows EXACTLY whats going on there. We don't need the media to tell us.|`|987b94f30a4bdb27f91489a6e76d2b29aa	For the majority of the protesters. Good turnout. The right to demonstrate is a cornerstone in democracy and should be encouraged.<br>  <br>  For the small number of masked demonstrators that you can see on the news failing to do any real damage to a bunch of police cars even though they have several minutes to do it, I think they are mainly riot-happy kids. Take a look at the videos, most of them are a lot shorter than the other demonstrators.
