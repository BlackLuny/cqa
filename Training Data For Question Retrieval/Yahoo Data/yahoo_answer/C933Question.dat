I was in college, met my wife at my part time job, accidentally got pregnant, got married and so it goes. In the meantime college wasn't working out so I dropped out, and now I’m working an hourly job until I do something else (planning to go to technical school in the fall hopefully). Well since then with various job losses, etc. we’ve accumulated about 8,000 in credit card debt on top of that, both of us have car notes that we had before we got together. Well until recently we had been making the payments (minimum at least) on the cards and all of our other bills and just been scraping by (not to mention us letting other relatives put bills in our name which is a completely different story that we’ve learned a life lesson from). Well my wife lost her job, and on top of that my truck broke down and is requiring about $600 of repairs in order to get it running

20090227170954AAq0Qso	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	I have a question for a advanced professional tax preparer.?	Hello,       I am a newer tax preparer and I have a question about Gifts to family members. I was wondering if a person (my client) who took money out of their IRA to help out a family member with about 10,000 cash could write that gift off on their taxes. Because of this withdrawal of funds, taxes are being calculated as income causing  my client to owe the IRS this year. I am hoping for some advice and thank you in advance.

I am an independent contracter and the majority of my income is in cash from families i babysit from.  However, because I work for a company, the supervisor issued me a number of paychecks in the cases where the families paid her with a credit card.   How do I include this on my tax forms? I filled out the schedule C 1040...should I ONLY put income from cash payments on here and then include the amount received from my boss (recorded on the W2) on the 1040?   Thank you to whoever can help me!!
20090225073736AAufb0g	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	How can I help a relative financially without messing up my own credit?	A relative of mine (mother) lost her job months ago and also has a ton of debt (and does not own anything-like a house).  She is in her 60s and also have no savings for retirement.  I am her only family member.  I want to help- potentially have her become a dependent of mine and either have her live in my house (which I own with my husband) or pay to rent a room for her somewhere else.  BUT, I do not want to be held responsible for any of her debt.  Does anyone know where I can find out about things like this?  I have no idea who to talk to about it.  If I make her my dependent, am I automatically responsible for her debt?  Thanks for reading.
