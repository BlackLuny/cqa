ubrYk78waa	There is an old country song by Tom T. Hall - "I Like Beer".

5uOKHBFPaa	I'm not sure what that is. But i'm pretty sure that you wouldn't be able to get a free membership in the same name twice. Your best bet would be to give it a shot and if not your only other option would be to have a friend/family member/spouse put it in their name, or pay the money :)
AA11642531	If the package was sealed as you indicate, there is no problem with the food being contaminated. The expiration date indicates the time that it will have the best flavor.

8adee73ccc06e52ea84f99eba7588af8aa	Forget words like light and dark, lighter and heavier, or malty vs. hoppy.  Both ales and lagers can fit all those descriptions, and those things come from the ingredients.  The main difference is what the yeasts do when they're fermenting the sugars into alcohol.    Since the yeast ferment at cooler temperatures in a lager, the taste tends to be cleaner and crisper.  Since the yeast fement warmer in an ale, there tend to be a wider variety of flavors present.  Personally, I generally prefer ales.|`|YKekI0W6aa	personal preference my friend, I prefer an ale or a porter...but that's just me.|`|z7JDA5tZaa	ale is top fermented while lager is bottom fermented. it doesn't really matter. the only difference is the color. lagers may have darker colors. they are not heavy in the stomach. the alcohol content makes it heavy. the higher the alcohol, the heavier and more dangerous to our health. too much intake may cause death.|`|L6u8Tgq7aa	Which is better? I can't answer that.  there are examples of dark and heavy lagers ie. German Swartsbier,  and examples of lite and hoppy ales ie. English Pale Ales.    an ale is top fermented at warmer temperatures for a shorter period of time than its cousin lager which is bottom fermented over a much longer period of time at lower temperatures.    my personal preference is usually a dark ale that has been moderately hoped. But a nice hoppy Bohemian lager shure hits the spot on a hot summer day.    If youre just looking to get drunk, drink vodka...savour your beer.    cheers,  Jah Hardway|`|JxCCjH0Uaa	they are both really heavy to me and lager has more of a hoppy flavor|`|2zd9OjeMaa	Lager is generally lighter and crisper, ale has a much wider range of styles and flavors. Both get you drunk.|`|VYWaL2graa	Lager definitely has a hoppier flavor, ales can have a nutty flavor to them.     If you just want to get drunk, it's more economical to buy some hard liquor. If you can't stand the taste, store it in the freezer . Cold lessens the intensity.|`|rE15gSFraa	Ale is a much heavier beer that sits in your tummy. Not lager, It's generally lighter in color, tate and thickness.  Lager's are way better and you can drink more of them, since they're lighter.  Ale is more bitter.  But you shouldn't drink to get drunk silly boy.
wg3KFiVqaa	SLOW! do not rush the food. Also, a handfull of apples and some hickory chips in an aluminum foil packet turns any grill (even gas) into a smoker.

Before you start the cooking any meat, rub the grill with oil to prevent your meat or patties from sticking.   Marinades tenderize meat, keep them moist during cooking, and enhance flavor. Overnight marinating is ideal for meat to absorb all the seasoning. If you dont have the time, try to marinate the meat at least 2 hours prior to cooking.   Baste the meat during the barbecuing process with the marinade if sugar content is minimal. If you wait to baste the meat towards the last quarter of cooking, it could cause the meat to dry out.   When turning meat, be sure to use a Tong and a spatula   Please dont pierce the meat with a fork. You will lose the flavorful juices of the meat.   Dont add any salt until the meat is cooked to avoid it from getting dry and tough.   If you are using an old fashioned charcoal barbecue, light coals about 30 minutes prior to cooking.|`|l47z8bFfaa	If you are cooking ribs you want to cook them bone down first this will keep the meat from drying out or under cooking the meat. With steak you don't want you coals or gas to hot so that it cooks it to fast will shrink or dry your meat out really fast. As for marinades the best a are home made cause you can make it how you like it to taste,but I sometimes use A-1 Marinades : Chicago Steak House, New York Steak House, They have a great teriyaki and Jamaican jerk as well give those a try they work well with most meats. You can also mix with honey bbq sauce taste pretty good well hope this helps you out a little
WbyFUQJbaa	I got this from an awesome website, hope it helps!    Things Youll Need:  8 medium sized firm apples   8 wooden sticks - buy at your local party supply or grocery store. (You can use popcicle sticks or bamboo skewers with excess cut off)   Candy Thermometer   Saucepan or pot   Greased baking sheet (to put finished apples on)   3 cups white sugar   1/2 cup light corn syrup   1 cup water   1/4 teaspoon cinnamon extract(optional)   1/4 teaspoon red food coloring       Step1Wash and dry the apples. Remove stems and insert sticks. If using popsicle sticks first insert knife into apple where you want the stick to go in.   Step2Put sugar, corn syrup, water, cinnamon & food coloring in pan and heat over a medium high heat stirring until sugar dissolves. You do not want to bring to a boil until after the sugar has dissolved or sugar crystals will form. Once dissolved, bring to a boil until candy thermometer reads between 290 - 300 degrees farenheit. Do not stir once it has started to boil, again to avoid sugar crystals. Remove from heat.   Step3Holding wooden stick, dip apples into coating mixture. You may need to spoon mixture over apples to coat completely. Try and work quickly as coating will begin to harden. If mixture thickens or cools too much, reheat briefly before proceeding. If desired, quickly dip coated apple in optional toppings, or sprinkle them over apple before coating hardens. Place coated apples with stick pointing skyward onto greased baking sheet. Completely cool before serving.   Step4Optional Topping Ideas:    * Candy Corn  * Shredded Coconut  * M&M's  * Chopped Nuts  * Chocolate Chips  * Candy Sprinkles   Step5For a halloween flair, omit cinnamon flavoring and use orange food coloring instead of red to make the apples look like pumpkins. Then make a face on the apples using black licorice pieces cut into shapes to make the eyes, nose & mouth.|`|635cf52bb9798114e759826efa24d70aaa	Safeway has the packets in the fruit above apples with chocolate and Carmel also.

VZudmlOoaa	I'm not too sure on what you could do, but make sure there's a few options so that people can choose and won't get bored.    Get lots of great food, and party decorations. Although some people say they're silly and tacky, at the end of the day, people have great fun and it always brings a smile to someones face with lots of balloons, party poppers, silly hats to wear while eating etc.    Also, there's a great website called:  www.photobox.co.uk    And on here, although some things are quite expensive, you can upload your own photos, and put them onto things such as:  coasters, jugsaws, pillows, calendars, notebooks, mugs, diaries, or just simple prints of that picture in different formats. It might be quite fun to pick some of her favourite / maybe embarassing / family photos or photos of when she was young and to print them onto things to surprise her when she walks through the door.

6nzGlDzpaa	Your rolls will be fine!  They will take a bit longer to rise, but other than that, there will be no difference.  By the way....when you go to cut them, use a clean string---or even a thread out of a sewing kit.  Run the string under the roll & raise both ends up, cross over and pull tight.

eshummTJaa	there is no nutritional value in dead animal flesh....|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	Red meat is a good source of iron.  Depending on what the animal was eating many kinds of meat can be a good source of omega fatty acids.      Animals have pretty much everything needed to keep other animals alive.  It's posible to live off nothing but meat for a long time.|`|J54q2aVtaa	Meat is only good for you if you really don't care about your diet at all.    For those people who are lazy with their nutrient intake, eating meat is great!  But for those who are smart about their nutrient intake, you can get all the nutrients you need without worrying about cholesterol levels or many other diseases by being vegetarian.|`|AA11703652	No, it usually has iron and a lot of trace minerals, like magnesium, that a body needs.  i can always tell when i need to eat some red meat-my body tells me it needs iron and trace minerals, so I crave steak or burgers!|`|2n4nCec1aa	It's a high source of protein, iron and many vitamins including B vitamins.  If you're concerned about getting protein from non meat sources, beans such as garbanzo (chic peas), kidney, white beans (cannelloni) and pintos are an excellent source.  They're higher in fiber but less nutritious as far as B vitamins and iron.  Protein from small portions of meat, especially lean cuts can actually help fight hunger because it takes longer to digest then other protein sources, helps to build lean muscle mass and fight off fatigue while trying to lose weight!|`|kMK9E2a7aa	The majority of people eat meat because they enjoy it. It can be very healthy within a balanced diet.|`|b9wICW1Paa	Meat contains a number of nutrients, and as another suggested, an animal can contain all the nutrients the human body requires.  The catch is that you need to eat the whole beast - not just the muscle meats but the organs, tongue, etc.  And not all cooked, either.  Since most people on this website are not likely to have this inclination, then all of their nutrition needs cannot be met from meat alone.    Animal products in general, meat included, do contain essential nutrients that in plant based foods are either not present in sufficient concentrations, have limited bio-availability, or are not present at all.  Vitamin B12, taurine (amino acid), Vitamin A, Vitamin D, zinc, iron, and several Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) would fall into these categories.  Even cholesterol and saturated fats are considered by many to be important nutrients, and animal products are the richest sources of either (only source in the case of cholesterol).    Many groups living in the world today, such as Okinawans, Hunza, Vilcambambans, and Abkhasians are renowned for their health and longevity.  They appear to rely on fresh foods from whole sources and, according to some vegetarian organizations, consume little, if any animal products.  The fact is that all of these peoples consume animal products of some kind - the quantity does not appear to be as relevant as the fact that they all consume them in the first place.    I do feel, however, that protein is often overrated and our requirements overestimated.  A moderate, even small, amount of animal products in addition to fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and legumes will not only likely meet all your micronutrient, but also macronutrient needs.  Refer to my sources for further, and more detailed information.|`|7EiB9Yayaa	It's high in protein and low in carbohydrates which is good for those watching their macronutrient intake. That can be accomplished in other ways but meat is generally easier for some.|`|asu0gj4qaa	I know you get vitamin B from red meat... and that is very good for you... and protein which you know already.. and iron ( that's good stuff too!)

Meat IS good for you ;)|`|ew5uqfdpaa	Meat contains every non water soluble vitamin and nutrient a human can consume.    Not all meats contain these vitamins and nutrients and some cooking methods even burn them away.     The only thing that doesnt come naturally from meat is those water soluble vitamins like C.     And it depends on the source:    Are they land animals?  Are they herbivores?  What kind of vegetation do they eat?  What kind of climates are they in?    These and more can affect what vitmans and nutrients an meat product can have.|`|BbK0fA4Laa	Nope, its also good for fat, b12, and many other nutrients.|`|y9tMWuQjaa	There are vitamins and minerals to be found in meat with the protein. It also contains some fats, which are useful (but in excess, harmful) to the body. Vegetarians must intake some fats from other sources, such as nuts or oils.     An example of a vitamin in meat is vitamin B12. An example of a mineral is Iron.

It will take up lots of the basil.    Chop it up and pack in ice cube trays, top with water and freeze.  Then you can add it to recipes and it will still taste fresh    Eat Lots of fresh tomato, basil and mozzarella salads with balsamic vinaigrette.  It's the best!    Chop it up and add it to home made chicken soup.    Chop it up and add it to your tossed salads.    Make some home made tomato sauce for spaghetti and add lots in the sauce    Make grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches with basil leaves in them.    Add it to meatloaf.    Make chicken or veal saltimbocca but use basil leaves instead of sage leaves    Find out how to dry it.  However, it doesn't taste the same dry vs. fresh
ZS7Ew7F3aa	Burning more calories than you consume = weightloss. Simple as that.    HOWEVER, you need to eat...for obvious reasons but also because too few calories will cause your metabolism to slow down, or shut down altogether, & you will stop burning fat & start burning off muscle. It's called 'starvation', and you WILL end up overeating, out of your body's sheer desire to survive...literally.    SO,  Eat several small, healthy meals/snacks a day - & be sure to include a high protein breakfast which has been proven to jump start your metabolism & keep you feeling full longer.  Drink LOTS of water - it flushes out toxins, improves the  overall health of your body, increases weight loss, gives you beautiful skin & hair & so much more!  Excersise - do cardio workouts for heart-health & to burn calories but also include weight training because this is what really builds muscle & muscle speed metabolism considerably. The more muscle you have the higher your metabolism rate...the faster you will burn the fat!!|`|7swefA6Paa	you need a balance of both in order to get all the nutrients that your body needs in order to maintain health    eating one over the other will not make you lose weight faster it will just make you sick, and malnourished|`|IcBdShB1aa	fruits and vegies  eat healthy not neccesarilly diet, and excercise.|`|vQJf2mIKaa	I am a veg girl!

You can do fruits one day and veggies the next :) have a half cup of ice cream, but do not forget to go to gym or take a walk 3 times a week|`|AA11402528	eat smaller portions of everything|`|13rfC5yEaa	eating a normal amount of healthy food.|`|LUzaYANnaa	eating fruit and veggies becase if you eat nothing at all, it will make you lose weight but it will make you really really sick|`|TieTzfAdaa	Eating healthy meals including 2 to 3 servings of fruits and veggies each day will help you maintain a healthy weight. You might lose some too. Not eating is a BAD mistake.|`|jukuEmVtaa	eat all kind of fruits every morning. eat veggies as much you can.  lose weight is doing working at home or do many things.|`|WWq4kJeDaa	eating fruit and vegetables is definately better than eating nothing at all. if you eat nothing is is bad for you ody and your stomach shrinks so if you want toeat after it would be hard because your body would reject it most likely. eating fruits and  vegetables is much more nutritious, they are loaded with vitamins and energy. eating healthy is a much better option than eating nothing at all.    i am not sure what would make you lose wait quicker but i know that eating nothing at all is wrong for your body.

But at work we either peel into the trash or on the block.  I prefer peeling onto anything I can clean in case I drop it.  If it goes in the garbage can, we deem it gone, no washing.|`|JqfIJtvYaa	The best place for your peels to go is as compost, I think you like this girl though don't you? So relate to her.|`|Sb93dIXbaa	It's a preference, but if you peel potato's in the sink don't put them down the garbage disposal or you will clog up the sink.|`|7eBuPdwQaa	Personally, I peel them in the sink after thoroughly washing the sink with soap and water, and then washing the vegetable after it is peeled as well.|`|ZS7Ew7F3aa	I peel mine into the sink then transfer it to our compost bin =)|`|B1ueclBaaa	I peel mine onto a cutting board that I dump in the trash, then wash before cutting the veg's.

faZuAHkbaa	why not? works great for raw salmon.|`|9z5NASypaa	slices of smoked salmon with japanese picked ginger and lemon and soya sauce. Mix around a bit of wasabi (not too much as its quite hot) in a bowl of soya sauce, cover the salmon with lemon juice and dip it in to the soy wasabi. soooooo good! its called Sashimi.|`|u4liwDhAaa	It is good with smoked salmon.|`|43c2090a4b22ec25d94e963c330ebd61aa	wasabi is very good , you can serve it to most see food ,like prawn lobster oyster any thing from see and also sushi.|`|Q4oPyclQaa	I just need to correct Sacha...    What you have created is not sashimi. Sashimi is an appetizer of fresh raw fish sliced and arranged on a tray for eating with chopsticks.  This is sometimes misnamed as "sushi" in western food.    I can't imagine that tasting good, either, by the way... all the components taste good by themselves but why would you ruin smoked salmon by adding ginger and wasabi?!?  What you do is you put the smoked salmon in a maki roll, dip it in soy sauce with wasabi, and eat the gari (ginger) afterwards.  Much better.|`|QAwwmDuDaa	I don't know what wasabi is,is it a cross between a wasp and a bee,lol.
RTkjZ6Ltaa	certain fast food places may provide some coupons through their websites but you usually have to sign up for their newsletter

But what joy if it were possible!     Unfortunately pickles are brined cucumbers, which means they are mostly salt, water, and fiber.    Cucumber trivia: http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/...    It may be possible to live off pickles if you added a very good source of protein and Vitamin D. Pickles, beans, and milk.     Mmmm..... beans.|`|2n4nCec1aa	No but I love pickles!  They're great if you're sort of hungry and don't want to eat right then.  They're awesome if you're hung over.  However, because of the high salt content you'll end up puffy and bloated if you only eat pickles.  And they have almost no nutritional value.  But eat them to curb your appetite but not to replace real food or else you'll get sick .
mzk0t6Ovaa	Do not lower the oven temperature.  Most home ovens don't<br>  get hot enough to actually cook a proper pizza.<br>  <br>  Is the top burning?  If so, you may want to check your oven (assuming<br>  it's electric) to see if there's a top element that might be adding too<br>  much top heat and scorching the toppings.<br>  <br>  Is the bottom of the crust burning?  If so, that's not a bad thing.  In<br>  fact a proper pie will have some darkening/caramelization on the<br>  crust when it comes out of the oven.<br>  <br>  If you're getting too much top heat, crank your oven temp as high as<br>  it'll go (likely 450F - 500F), wait until the oven comes to temp, and<br>  put the pie in the oven for 4-7 minutes depending on desired level of<br>  doneness.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, pre-cook your crusts for 5-8 minutes in a 400F oven.<br>  Once they're pre-cooked, pull them and let them cool.  Sauce and<br>  dress them, then put them back in a 450F - 500F oven for 3-4 minutes<br>  to melt the toppings.|`|AA10625089	Temp too high.<br>  Cooked too long.<br>  Forgot to take it out of the oven.|`|7623Hd7naa	If it was on fire when the delivery person got there, you should call the pizza place for a refund cuz that's messed up!|`|AA11402528	lower the temperature and cook it less|`|bQisGgSsaa	The oven is on too High or you left it in too long.|`|IY3XBGcGaa	It has an STD.

EMDNVrcjaa	You could either use all her favorite plays or just pick her favorite play to design everything around. A red carpet runner with velvet ropes and a ticket podium at the entrance would be fun. You could use pieces of paper that look like tickets for place cards or invitations. You could make "swag" bags for favors. Playbills from her favorite shows for centerpieces or invitations. You could maybe make fake Tony awards for the centerpieces or favors. You could make a "starboard" of the guest of honor. A New York Skyline outline on the wall. Everyone could dress very fancy. Karaoke with songs from her favorite shows. <br>  <br>  It sounds like a lot of fun. I hope this gets your creative juices flowing!

7bcb396f7dc8eb49aa30225443dd5e2baa	My second gourmet pizza project began when I saw the basis for a great taco pizza recipe on Pizzamarketplace.com. I made a batch of Bill’s Traditional dough allowing it to rise in the breadmaker for almost 2 hours by mistake! It was over the top of the bread pan. I removed it, balled it and placed the balls in the refrigerator for later in the evening. The balls continued to rise to more than twice their size by 7:00 pm.<br>  <br>  I gathered and prepared all of the ingredients for the taco pizza while the dough proofed. Here are the ingredients:<br>  <br>  Base:<br>  2/3 c - Taco Sauce<br>  2/3 c - Pizza Sauce (I used my Neapolitan Sauce)<br>  1/4 c - Refried beans<br>  1 bag - Ortega brand Taco meat seasoning<br>  1 lb. - Ground Beef<br>  1 1/2 c - Mozzarella cheese<br>  <br>  Topping (after baking):<br>  Shredded Cheddar cheese<br>  Shredded Lettuce<br>  Chopped Tomato<br>  Sliced Black Olives<br>  Sour Creme<br>  <br>  The beef was browned in a skillet and drained. Then I mixed in the packet of taco meat seasoning and some water as per the instructions on the bag. Assembly was easy. Once the dough was stretched, I mixed the taco sauce, pizza sauce, and refried beans and spread it on the blank. Next, a layer of mozzarella was laid with the taco meat sprinkled on top. Another layer of mozzarella was placed over the meat. The pizza baked for 11 minutes at 480 degrees.<br>  <br>  Once out of the oven, the pizza was cut then topped with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes and sliced black olives. <br>  <br>  The flavor of the taco pizza was great! The base sauce had a great taste and had texture to it. The refried beans offset the tangy tomato and cheddar. This is a hearty pizza - an 11 inch pie fed 3 adults and two young children. I will definitely be making this one again soon|`|5562411c1f650e6f6b02d39e27144b9eaa	<a href="http://www.topsecretrecipes.com/home.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.topsecretrecipes.com/home.asp</a>

vejHKjEDaa	It depends upon what you want to prepare - there are different types of dough.  If this is for an assignment, shouldn't you be reading recipes and checking the purpose for each ingredient?  Seems this is the best way to learn something.  The answer begins with a letter near the middle of the English alphabet.  Note:  I feel badly so - the primary answer is the leavening agent.  In breads and some pastries it's yeast, in cakes, muffins and quick-breads it's baking powder.  Success also depends upon the liquid to flour ratio and without salt any will taste dreadful.  Muffins have more oil to egg ratio than cakes have - this makes them heavier and not as crumbly as a cake.|`|qqb4xdpQaa	depending of what your going to use the dough for, I'll just guess and say you want an all purpose dough.  High gluten flour and a batch of live yeast, mix the yeast with some warm water and add to the flour, also you may want some oil and a few eggs. Then just fold and fold and fold until you get thoroughly mixed...add more water or flour depending on the consistancy you want for it.

Wish I'd discovered this talent a long time ago....|`|432d817139a5e0be18e400a33e0e1908aa	1. This recipe solves the twin problems of how to open the oysters if you dont have an oyster knife and then eating them raw by cooking them in their shells.     ROAST OYSTERS    Serves 2    INGREDIENTS    Salt  4 oysters    METHOD    Put the oysters, deep shell down, on a mound of salt on a baking tray.     Cook in a preheated oven at 200C, 400F, gas mark 6 for 5 minutes or until they open.     Flip off the bottom shells. Cut the oysters away from the top shell. Add a dash of lemon juice or Tabasco sauce.     You can re-use the salt.     2. I am going to do this main course for my Valentine's meal for my lady friend.     SMOKED SALMON TAGLIATELLE (TAGLIATELLE AL SALMONE AFFUMICATO)    Serves 2     INGREDIENTS     125g pack of smoked salmon pieces  2 cloves of garlic  1 onion  1 tablespoon of olive oil  1 tablespoon of flour  150ml carton of single cream  1 teaspoon of mixed herbs  At least 300ml of water    ? of a teaspoon of salt  200g of tagliatelle  Ground pepper to taste    METHOD    Cut the smoked salmon into 2cm (1 inch) pieces. Peel the garlic and chop it into tiny pieces. Peel the onion and chop it into tiny pieces.     Put the oil into a frying pan on a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook for a couple of minutes until the onion has gone soft. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. Add the flour and stir until it has absorbed the oil and juices in the pan. Add the cream, herbs and smoked salmon. Stir and cook for about a minute until it has made a smooth sauce.     Put the water and salt into a saucepan on a medium heat. Bring to the boil. Add the pasta. Stir it to stop it sticking to the bottom of the pan. Bring back to the boil and continue to cook. Stir frequently to stop it sticking.     Begin testing it about 2 minutes before the packet instructions say it should be done. The best way to judge if pasta is cooked is to bite it. This is tricky, because if you fish out a bit and stick in your mouth you may burn your mouth on the boiling water. Wait a bit and blow on it, then bite it. If it is hard it needs longer. If it is chewy (or al dente, Italian for to the teeth) it is ready. If it is soft it is overcooked.      Drain the pasta in a sieve or colander.     Always take the pasta to the sauce. Put the pasta in the pan with the sauce and stir together until thoroughly coated.     Season with the pepper.    ADDITIONS & ALTERATIONS    Use crme fra?che instead of the cream.     The half cream, half green mixed tagliatelle (called paglia e fieno, or straw and hay) looks really good with this sauce.     TIPS    If you use enough water, add the pasta when the water is boiling, stir the pasta frequently and dont wander off (Gli spaghetti amano la compagnia, or spaghetti loves company) and dont overcook it, adding olive oil to the water to stop it sticking is totally unnecessary.     3. RICH CHOCOLATE DESSERT    This is the easiest, richest chocolate dessert ever. Just dont make or eat too much.     Makes 4 servings      INGREDIENTS    200g of dark chocolate*   1 egg  300ml (1 medium carton) of single cream  1 drop of vanilla essence**  A pinch of salt    METHOD    Break the chocolate into pieces and put into a bowl. Crack the egg into a cup and pick out any bits of shell.    Put the cream into a saucepan on a low heat. Gently warm the cream to boiling point. Pour over the chocolate and leave for 5 minutes until the chocolate has melted.     Add the egg, vanilla essence and salt to the chocolate and cream. Mix until it is smooth.     Pour into cups, glasses or ramekins. Cool in the fridge for 3 to 4 hours.     ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES    You can use eating chocolate, but check the ingredients to see if it has had vanilla added already. If it has, you dont need to add any more. This could be useful, if you dont want to buy a bottle of vanilla essence to just use one drop.     Use white chocolate instead of dark. Use both dark and white chocolate in alternate layers in a glass.    Use crme fra?che instead of the cream.     Keep a square of the chocolate and grate it onto the top. Put a teaspoon of Cointreau, rum or whisky on top. Get a big carton of cream and serve with the remainder of the cream, lightly whipped.     For the ultimate romantic version, top with a large fresh strawberry, half dipped in melted chocolate and offer this to your partner.     IMPORTANT NOTE    This dish contains raw egg. It is therefore unsuitable for babies, toddlers, pregnant women, elderly people or people who are unwell.     * Use at least 70% cocoa cooking chocolate.     ** Vanilla essence is not the same as vanilla extract or vanilla flavouring. It should be in the home baking aisle.     PS. For the ultimate chocoholic version, use the 100% cocoa Venezuelan Black cooking chocolate from Willie Harcourt-Cooze, who was featured on television recently.|`|AA10466359	Start with choice of    1 3oysters on the half shell    2 or 4 fried oysters   3.

doz7RIoeaa	The same way they and you should feel when other people say they love animals and people and yet lock their homes at night to keep them away.   You see, hypocrisy has many levels.

Semantics can be fun when used to point out hypocrisy of the self righteous,|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	yeah, doesn't matter if you don't know the animal , you can still be certain it suffered. I used to be a person who said you could eat bacon for breakfast and be an animal lover. Now, my view is quite different.

Its normal and socially respectable to say 'I love animals' - but it doesn't mean that those people really respect them. If they did they wouldn't eat them.    How people can love animals called 'pets', but eat animals called 'dinner' is rather beyond me. It is hypocrisy to the worst degree.|`|J54q2aVtaa	They are unbelievably hypocritical.  These people are not even worth the time it takes to deal with them.    They might as well run a cat sanctuary that not only shelters homeless cats but also sells them on the food menu.|`|2q0CNeg0aa	i love them dearly but they are just so damn goodd im sorry little cows and pigs and all the animals that i eat *CRYING *|`|kMK9E2a7aa	I live in a country in Europe that has a different perspective towards animals. Many people here have dogs, most are kept outside in kennels. The dogs are all treated well but unlike the UK, they are not part of the family. Nobody here loves animals as you put it. They have respect for animals, but they are not put on a par with humans.   The busiest shop in the village is the butcher. It's almost a focal point of the village.  Every country in the world will view your question differently, even within Europe.|`|XxSj6AsBaa	I assume this question is meant as a joke.  Animals are not capable of emotion,especially one as complex as love.  Therefore it stands to reason that love is an emotion reserved just for other people.  As for rights, you must remember that with rights comes responsibilities.  Animals have neither, but they are yummy.    As for your blood pressure, they have medications for that.  I am sure that my blood pressure too would rise, just trying to justify the relevance of this question. (which BTW was never restricted to Vegans)    Please pass the chops.|`|7E2kGw2naa	Some people will always be stupid.  End of story.  Get over it.      "The same way they and you should feel when other people say they love animals and people and yet lock their homes at night to keep them away.   You see, hypocrisy has many levels."    I don't think hypocrisy means what you think it means.|`|f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	It strikes me as really strange. When someone says that they just LOVE animals, I often ask if they would eat their dog or cat. They then (usually) say, "Well, that's different."   I ask: "How?"  They say: "It's my pet and it's smart"   I say:"Cows and pigs are as smart if not smarter than dogs and cats."  **blank stare**   I go on: "People have domesticated pot bellied pigs and keep them as pets, so the whole barnyard animal v/s family pet line has been crossed..."  **blank stare**  They say: "Well, dogs and cats don't taste good"  I ask: "So you HAVE eaten dog and cat meat before?!"  They exclaim: "NO!"  I wonder aloud: "Then how do you know what it tastes like?"  They say: "It's what I've heard. There's a reason we don't eat them."  I point out: "But Asian cultures have been known to eat them. People all over the globe eat animals that Americans don't normally eat."  They say: "What's your point?"  I reply: "You don't love all animals. You only love the ones you don't eat. You are basically saying that you don't eat animals that you like. If you liked cows, chickens, pigs, etc., you wouldn't -or couldn't -  eat them."   **blank stare**    Never ceases to amaze me. To each his own.     And btw- I don't go around picking this fight. It usually just starts up once people learn that I'm vegan and they try to say something smart-aleky.|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	Hypocrites.  I was born vegetarian (I was born in a caste where non vegetarianism isn't allowed.) Everyone makes fun of this caste because they feel vegetarians are sissies.  But I disagree!!  I hate people who say that|`|M3k9GOSsaa	Sorry to admit that I am one of those people (going to make your blood pressure rise, sorry about that). Some people choose to live the way that they do, and getting angry about it won't fix your problem with it. I love every animal under the sun and eat meat, if that makes you angry, it seems like a more personal problem to get angry, however, I do understand your cause.     Coming from a person that grew up in a "meat-eating" family, it is very hard to change your lifestyle, even when you do love animals. I give you full props for changing your lifestyle to not eat meat. Somethings are hard for other people to do. I would try to understand "why not try being a vegetarian?" rather than giving a "why are you a hypocrite for loving animals yet eating them?" stance.    I have given tofu a chance and even some alternative vegetarian foods (as my friends are Indian... ahem... but they still eat meat sometimes). It happens.    I respect you for asking the question. People love tradition and unfortunately eating meat is one of those traditions. Start a new fad by being understanding of both sides. Maybe it won't make your blood boil so much.|`|SfatAG9Gaa	If they truly love animals, they wouldn't eat them. I wouldn't take a bite out of my cats leg or my German Shepherd's belly, so why would I gnaw on a chicken leg or eat bacon? If you love animals, you love animals and therefore wouldn't eat them. I think carnivores lack education.|`|spS2lnDXaa	It's obnoxious.

I truly love animals and purchase cruelty free meat knowing this makes me enjoy my meal just that bit more.|`|tbzVUKcyaa	that doesnt bother me a lot, but its more when people have asked you why you are one then give laim comebacks like theyre giving their life for you or they wouldnt have been born of they hadnt been bred to eat them. the thing i dislike the most though is that they assume we are all pychotic and are so confused what to feed us.|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	i don't have a problem against animals but i love chicken,beef and pork  the animals that you so called care about you can't eat them like a dog that would be cruel and nasty|`|b9wICW1Paa	It really does seem contradictory on the surface - many refer to this apparent value system where the life of one animal is deemed greater than another as "speciesism."    But it's easy to see where this attitude originates.  Dogs, cats, horses, and to some extent oxen, have historically been very useful animals who have served us better alive than as meat on the table.  They have worked with humans, or at least for our interests in the case of cats (vermin killers), and perhaps are therefore viewed much differently than other animals (although often not treated much differently).  They have been and still are companions, and are often with us even in the absence of other humans.    What people usually mean by this is they love "pets," not animals in general.  I can see how humans might be able to empathize with cats and dogs in particular more so than most ruminants or herbivorous animals such as cattle and sheep.  Cats and dogs have a natural disposition towards meat-eating, like us, whereas herbivores do not, generally speaking.  Dogs, and perhaps even cats to some extent, have historically helped humans in the hunt, and consequently shared in the kill.  There is without a doubt a historical and/or traditional bond.       Of course you are probably aware that not all communities in the world share the taboo of eating what some deem pet species.  In many places, these animals are in fact on the menu and are even considered "health foods."  Horse meat, for instance, is considered a delicacy in some parts of Scandanavia and other European countries, while dog and cat are clearly eaten and enjoyed in many parts of Asia.  Guinea pig is prized in many South American countries.     So, to answer the question, from a strictly philosophical point of view and with regards to semantics it is certainly a hypocritical attitude.  But it's also easy to see why there is such a differentiation with consideration to history and tradition.|`|68OnZt24aa	Omg that piss me off!!  i mean how can you really LOVE animals and yet you eat them. when you dont HAVE to     everytime i hear someone say that i wanna slap they face|`|gKE00nMvaa	What do you care?

Some don't see any contradition in killing a cow "respectfully"    I don't understand it, but its thier choice.    As for "loving" animals". No, i think meateaters use that word too lightly. You cannot possibly love something you are prepared to kill unnecessarily.    I see paulreegan has redefined "harm". he says "I would never harm an animal " How can you eat an animal without harming it ? me: perplexed at some peoples blindness|`|ja7J2cE2aa	I love the animals that I have an everyday relationship with.

But I look on my dinner table and I see a delicious well-seasoned perfectly-cooked steak that I have never known personally.  I suppose my answer for you is this: Do you suppose the steak loved me when it was still a cow?  No.  Thusly, I can claim I like animals, while still eating my delicious steak.      Go ahead, hate me.  It's still delicious...|`|xkV2rZuEaa	LOL I know same here, im a begetarian myself, and i dont like any animals entering my system, when i see others "claiming" they like them, and do go on eating them, it makes me head sick!!
AA10723688	Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Bacon and Pear :    French or Italian loaf bread, sliced  Bacon, cooked  Bartlett pear  Sharp white cheddar cheese (high quality) or loads of brie cheese   Butter, softened and spreadable    how to:  1).  Heat a cast iron skillet to medium high heat. Layer your sandwich - bread slice, cheese, pear slices, bacon, bread slice. Spread butter over the top of the sandwich. Place the sandwich top side down (butter side down) on the hot pan. Butter the exposed side of the sandwich. Let cook for a minute and then use a metal spatula to turn the sandwich over to its other side.    2).   While you are toasting the sandwich on the remaining side, press down on the sandwich with a spatula. Alternatively, you can mimic a panini press (albeit without the ridges) by heating a smaller cast iron pan on a separate burner. Use the weight of this pan to press down on the sandwich from above.    ** The sandwich is done when the sides are toasted and the cheese is melted. Cut in half and serve.      ``  ... or a grilled / toasted sandwich made with corned beef (or pastrami), sauerkraut (or coleslaw), brie cheese (or Swiss cheese), and either Russian dressing or Thousand Island dressing. Best made with rye bread or pumpernickel bread.    .... or a sandwich made with hamburger patty (or any ground meat... like goat), pieces of sauted or grilled onion, and brie cheese between two slices of rye bread or sourdough. The sandwich is then grilled so that the cheese melts thoroughly.    .... or  a hot ham and cheese (typically emmental, gruyre, brie) grilled sandwich  coated in a Mornay or Bchamel sauce!!! mmm....! I tried it once in Spain with sobrassada instead of ham and the taste was really interesting ;) . You can substitute one thing for the other, according to your likes (ex: smoked salmon instead of ham; a slice of pineapple; fresh sliced tomatoes).    ... or brie, ham, bread, lettuce, tomato, dill, pickles, mayonnaise, mustard.    ... or ham, brie, Italian bread, olive oil, Dijon mustard, mango chutney (apricot preserves are just too sweet for my taste..) or dried cherries and toasted cashews.    ``|`|i9beDOTAaa	cranberry sauce, brie and bacon..   yum yum|`|OTjWvphWaa	I know of a one really good recipe:  Take some bread that is hardy enough to be toasted/broiled for a few minutes that you can also put open face, so like a roll, or part of a loaf of french bread. Then take the brie in slices and line them on the bread, and then take some Jam or Jelly that you like. Broil this for about 4 minutes and enjoy. This is so simply, but the sweet and mild taste of brie make this a really cheap and delicious sandwich.|`|AA11634270	I like brie. so I'd say all of them.|`|JX0I6x1paa	Brie, dried apricots and walnuts.

TJOHxhEUaa	Normally, you grow yams (or sweet potatoes or kumera, for that matter) from sprouted tubers, not seeds.  Those don't transport well, so try letting your yams sit in a well-lit place in a bowl of water to get them going.  Here's a good site (instructions for sweet potatoes work for yams, too):    http://www.ncsweetpotatoes.com/index...=...

EBqFpZbjaa	Vodka is a clean white spirit which leaves no trace of smell on the breath.    The world's very best Vodka is made in the UK - SMIRNOFF - made originally by White Russian emigres fleeing the Bolsheviks.    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=IUUvfB99ze...    How to drink Vodka - Russian style.  Fill a small tumbler with Vodka to a depth of two or three fingers held along side the glass.  Place the head slightly forward, lips pressed against the side of the glass, tip head back and swallow all the Vodka [shot] in one go.  Throw empty glass into fireplace.    The Fabulous Red Army Choir  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=mbtXT9I25T...|`|DFXS4SB4aa	You can drink vodka straight up, or you can use it in mixed drinks. You can make Bloody Mary's, screwdrivers, vodka tonic, martinis, etc.     It's much stronger than beer, so you don't need to drink near as much.     A one ounce serving of 100 proof vodka (which is half alcohol by volume) contains 82 calories.     It will make your breath smell like alcohol, because it is alcohol.|`|C73WFizXaa	surely you cant care about the calories and leaving a smell on your breath etc. etc. - YOU DRINK BEER EVERY DAY FOR HEAVENS SAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  but yes, mix it with coke, pepsi, orange juice, red bull . . .anything really, DO NOT drink it like you drink beer though, v. dangerous.  if u have a shot glass anywhere, use that as a measure. pour enough vodka into the shot glass to fill it, then pour it into a normal sized glass, then add your "mixer" and top up the glass|`|ONuy5vniaa	1.mix it with orange juice, or cola    2.yes it does, but so does beer so what are you so worried about?    3.I have no idea.|`|KaOIK0AXaa	vodka cranberry.. redbulls good with it too. vodka tonic|`|bPZlpe0taa	It sounds like you're already on the piss|`|ixmOT0eOaa	The best way to drink Vodka for me is to mix in.

PDotv2Hsaa	Meat have lines running across them if you look at them carefully - simply cut your slices perpendicular to these lines.    http://www.askthemeatman.com/faq.htm  (Scroll down to the appropriate question)|`|5zNwBQZHaa	look at the top of the sirloin and you will see white streaks of fat in the red part of the meat.  Those white streaks are going in the same direction of the grain.      You want to cut across those grains - not along side of them.    This is a way to cut meat to make it feel more tender and easier to chew.    Good luck with the pho - I heard the broth is a big undertaking.  Enjoy.

DFXS4SB4aa	Stabilizing egg whites, increasing their heat tolerance and volume;  Preventing sugar syrups from crystallizing;  Reducing discoloration of boiled vegetables;  Frequent combination with baking soda (which needs an acid ingredient to activate it) in formulations of baking powder.  Commonly used in combination with potassium chloride in sodium-free salt substitutes|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	It is a white powder  that has been around  for  awhile, put to use by creative cooks in a variety of culinary applications. It is an acid and it is often used as a major component in baking powder, combined with baking soda to react when the mixture is moistened to ensure that baked goods will rise well. Although it is an acid, the cream of tartar and the baking soda will not react when dry, so the entire reaction is saved for the mixing bowl and the oven. More visibly, since most of us do not mix our own baking powder, cream of tartar is used as a stabilizing agent and is added to beaten egg whites to increase their stability and volume. It is also sometimes added to candies or frostings to give them a creamier texture because it can help to prevent the crystallization of cooked sugar.|`|RxBe4y3Waa	IT'S USED AS A THICKENER.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	I don't know all the uses, but a tiny pinch of it can be used when beating eggs into a foam for use in meringues and angel food cakes.

I40vnqNyaa	For the best steak you'll ever taste. I use oyster sauce (seems unlikely, but trust me). I put about a tablespoon or so on the steak and rub all over both sides with the back of a spoon. Leave to sit and marinate for a little while, but if time doesn't permit then thats ok you can just put it straight on the grill.. Instead of putting oil on the plate spray a little oil on the steak instead (steak wont stick and you'll get less smoke this way).    Trick to a good steak is to bring it to room temp before you cook it. Make sure the BBQ plate is really hot and sear steak on one side till browned and nicely caramalised. Then turn over and turn the heat down. Dont turn it over again just leave it till its cooked to the desired degree. You can do this in the pan but on the BBQ is better.  Then after its done, loosely cover with foil and let it rest on a plate for half the time it took to cook or approx 10 mins.      This has been working for me for many years and when i serve it i get lots of lip smacking and moans of pleasure LOL.. Rump or sirloin are a good cut but you can do this with anything, depends on your budget. :)|`|02fdd30cf9904e853e7fdbac52f61769aa	This is a very open question. Everyone is different when it comes to BBQ. Here is a simple approach and suggestions only.   Pick your meat. Once your meat is thawed (if necessary), season it to your taste. Let me marinade overnight if possible. You asked about grilling specifically, so: always use indirect heat, never place directly over coals or heat source. Slow grilling is the key to flavor and tenderness.   You normally will use either a dry rub or a wet sauce. Dry rub is taking your seasonings and rubbing them into the meat. Wet is brushing the meat during cooking process. This is once more a personal preference.   Cooking time will be determined by the type and size of meat. Example: A whole chicken will take longer to get cooked then a cut of chicken. A Boston Butt will take longer then a rack of ribs.   It is really a variance that is determined by your likes and dislikes, the same as recipes. You will need to expermint and find the seasoning combinations that you like. Just remember slow cooking over indirect heat. The other item to keep in mind is this: If you leave the meat uncoved while cooking it should develope a 'crust', where if you cover the same meat while cooking it will not develope that 'crust'. Once more it is determined by how you like your meat. The other thing to keep in mind is to 'mess' with the meat as little as possible once it is on the grill. It doesn't need to be moved every 5 minutes. Let it cook.   I hope this has helped you somewhat, and if I can help more, please just shoot  me a email. Good Luck.
vejHKjEDaa	Caffeine irritates the lining of the colon - for this reason a friend of mine can drink only herbal teas.  Caffeine also depletes the body of vitamins B and C and interferes with the absorption of iron plus other minerals.

CyIxcsz0aa	When the amount of alcohol you consume is reduced OR how often you drink is reduced, drinking a larger sum of alcohol will get you much more drunk then it did when you always drnk larger sums. NOT drinking also decreases tolerance.   Other factors?  -Weight (that's why girls get drunk much quicker then guys... for the most part)  -What you are drinking (If you're used to beer, doing Vodka shots might get you far more smashed- decreased tolerance to a TYPE of alcohol)  - How much you are eating (if you eat a big bowl of pasta and go out to eat, its gonna take a lot more alcohol to get f*cked up!)  -Medications and other drugs (some are a terrible combination!!)|`|LnoyylQ7aa	it waxes and wanes for everyone|`|csGKIic9aa	u stop drinking and or dont eat enough that day then yea.......

I simply can't do it.  If I drink too much, I feel nauseaous way earlier than I used to,  I get horrible indigestion, and I feel like I am coming down with the flu for the next day.   It's not worth it.       I remember what it felt like to tie one on, and I have some great memories.  I drank responsibly but I definitely had some damn good times.

As for throat burn, that's different for most people and also the initial throat burn on your first sip of any form of alcohol lessens with each subsequent drink you take.    The Merlot, if highly tannic will have the most burn at first.  Unless it's a huge, soft wine.  In order of sweetness, though, the Gewertz will be the sweetest, followed by the Pinot Gris (which is also Pinot Grigio), Sauv Blanc and then the Merlot.|`|vejHKjEDaa	It depends upon the year, where the grapes were grown, when harvested and length of the fermentation process.

The best way to enjoy it is to have tasty accompaniments. Try brown rice with spicy Thai curry (green / red whatever you like) and make sure you cook the rice properly... Here is the recipe I found online to cook brown rice:     1. Put brown rice and water together in a pot with a lid.  Use the ratio of 1.5 cups water to 1 cup rice.     2. Set the heat to maximum, and bring the rice/water to a boil uncovered.  Then put the lid on the pot, and reduce the heat to low/simmer.  If your lid has a steam valve, keep it closed.  Let the rice simmer for 20 minutes.     3. Turn off the heat, and let the rice sit in the covered pot for another 10 minutes.  Its OK if you let the rice sit longer than 10 minutes (20 or 30 minutes is fine too), but dont let it go any less.  I prefer my rice to be slightly chewy, not mushy, so I usually remove the lid after 10 minutes.     4. Eat and enjoy.  Be careful when you remove the lid, since a lot of steam may escape when you do.    You can also try wild rice... look it up online.    Brown pasta is usually thick and kind of hard, so no matter how much you try the texture is going to be bad. While cooking the pasta boil for a couple  more minutes than what it says on the instructions.    Of the three things that you have mentioned the easiest would be sweet potatoes. You can make tasty mashed sweet potatoes just like you make them with regular potatoes. It tastes good simply boiled in salt water or glazed with honey or palm sugar. One of my favorite way to enjoy them is as a warm desert - boiled sweet potatoes, sugar / honey, and milk... mash everything together to get a pudding consistency.. I just love that!|`|0652e17f9d7b965dbf45d90fb460f124aa	brown rice  http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Br...  http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Br...  http://homecooking.about.com/library/arc...    sweet potato  http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Sw...  http://www.whfoods.com/recipestoc.php  http://homecooking.about.com/library/arc...|`|y9tMWuQjaa	If brown rice tastes that bad it may be that you're not cooking it long enough. I tend to cook for twice as long as white rice! It can help to add a chicken stock cube to the cooking water and use a rice cooker.    I eat white rice after I discovered that there are still nutrients in it and it is a medium release carbohydrate on the Glycaemic index. So it isnt that bad.    Brown pasta tastes great in a pasta bake, again with sufficient cooking time. If it's a tomato sauce with good strong flavour I rarely notice the difference for pasta.    Brown bread I eat regularly because I genuinely prefer it. Brown pasta if the mood strikes, but rice is the thing I don't ever compromise!

One thing to think about when you go to colleges: Many colleges put laxatives in their food so that the food passes through the students faster and there is a smaller chance of food poisoning should something go wrong. So, maybe high schools do it too...|`|2f1472ed8347c911938eeda050845b03aa	Sandwich,, indian food|`|V6pE6S7iaa	i work where I live so I live in a apartment in the building i work in I just make   scrambled eggs with cheese and baked potato or a banana or even a apple next to it|`|y9tMWuQjaa	Most days I will pack my own lunch as of late.    I usually make a pasta salad with raw peppers, red onion, pasta, and a tin of mackerel or tuna. Sometimes I add sweetcorn or something. I then drizzle it with a store-bought salad dressing in the morning (I make enough for two days the night before).    I am looking into making a cold asian noodle salad using my own dressing. I aim to make the pasta salad with my own dressings too but baby steps.    I also am experimenting with sandwiches, which I don't normally like that much, but I'm having a good go. I am fortunate in that I prefer brown bread. I sometimes shove some spinach (fresh) or cheese into a sandwich, but I think I will try adding things like hummus.     I avoid store bought sandwiches because they are really really bad... the ingredients list is longer than my arm full of preservatives. Plus they use low quality ingredients and charge a huge amount for 2 slices of bread with a bit of mush inside.     Making my own really helps me reach my target of 5 fruit and veg a day.|`|jYLZYxDvaa	I like sandwiches and salads, subway is good.|`|AA11635314	I have always been a big fan of smearing a fresh can of pig brains on ritz crackers or delicious Bull testicle paste on english muffins.|`|D9PF4Emmaa	you know whats good a flat bread pizza with meat and veggies and a glass of tea w lemon no sugar or maybe a crystal light drink

Keep eggs in the original carton in the coldest part of your refrigerator. Throw away any eggs that are cracked, broken, or leaking.     It is best not to wash eggs before storing or using them. Washing is a routine part of commercial egg processing and the eggs do not need to be rewashed.     Fresh eggs in the shell - 3 to 4 weeks       Fresh egg whites - 2 to 4 days       Fresh egg yolks (unbroken and covered with water) - 2 to 4 days       Hard-cooked eggs - 1 week       Deviled eggs - 2 to 3 days       Leftover egg dishes - 3 to 4 days|`|K24w4xlvaa	Yes you can.

d19faee87d87426beb4d19828a1ffbdaaa	You didn't say what cut of meat... but a nice boneless sirloin is good. Just sprinkle with black pepper and garlic powder. Make sure pan is very hot. Sear for one minute on each side, then two, and so on until it is done to your liking. Don't use salt on it until you are ready to eat it.|`|1xr6T6h0aa	Marinate in balsalmic vinegar and garlic... Not too much... about 1 tablespoon of the BV for every 8 ounces of steak.  Let is marinate for about 30 minutes.  Then put a few ounces of olive oil - NOT extra virgin, regular olive oil.  It will taste amazing and moist.|`|AA10619480	Marinate the steaks in olive oil for at least 30 minutes. Drain off the oil  leaving a light film of oil on the steaks  and salt the steaks on both sides. Heat a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over a high setting. When hot add the steaks and char on one side. Turn the heat down to medium and continue cooking for about 3 minutes for medium rare. Turn the steaks with tongs and turn up the heat to high. Be careful not to cut into the steaks while turning so that you don't lose any of the juices. Sear the second side of the steaks, then turn the heat to medium and cook for another 3 minutes to medium rare. Add 2 to 3 minutes per side for well-done steaks. Serve with a green salad, Aji Asado (roasted marinated peppers), and Papas al Horno (roasted potatoes).|`|3VSZsXJ1aa	A nice bloody steak :) It takes like 15 min to make and its easy:  2 top sirloin, if your low on my money chucks  Sauce:  1/2 cup beef stock  shot of whiskey, if you really like him 2 shots of whiskey  2 knobs of butter    First you microwave that knob of butter, until fully melted, skim off the white stuff  Heat up a pan, add the butter  Salt and pepper your steak, add it to the hot butter  Then turn the fire to medium to low, and cook for 4 min-6 min on each side  Put the steaks on a plate, add the whiskey (watch out for eyebrows) until syrup forms  Add stock, reduce to half  Add the juice that the steaks emitted  Add the butter to finish her off  Pour onto your steaks    Some sides could be mashed taters or green beans    Desert, I would have a nice simple desert after that big meal    Scoop of ice cream and caramel bananas  1 1/2 cups sugar  1/3 cup water  1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups heavy cream  1/2 vanilla bean or 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract    Mix the water and sugar in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cover and cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat and boil uncovered until the sugar turns a medium brown, about 5 to 7 minutes,  Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon.   Watch it carefully at the end, as it will go from caramel to burnt very quickly.   Stand back to avoid splattering, and gradually add the cream and the seeds scraped from the vanilla bean (or vanilla extract).   Simmer until the caramel dissolves and the sauce is smooth and thick, about 2 minutes. Add your slices of bananas and serve on ice cream|`|I40vnqNyaa	For the best steak you'll ever taste.  I use oyster sauce (seems unlikely, but trust me).  I put about a tablespoon or so on the steak and rub all over both sides with the back of a spoon.  Leave to sit and marinate for a little while, but if time doesn't permit then thats ok you can just put it straight on the grill.. Instead of putting oil on the plate spray a little oil on the steak instead (steak wont stick and you'll get less smoke this way).      Trick to a good steak is to bring it to room temp before you cook it and let it rest for half the time it took to cook afterwards.  Just on a plate with loosely covered foil.  Make sure the BBQ plate is really hot and sear steak on one side till browned and nicely caramalised.  Then turn over and turn the heat down.  Dont turn it over again just leave it till its cooked to the desired degree.  You can do this in the pan but on the BBQ is better.      This has been working for me for many years and when i serve it i get lots of lip smacking and moans of pleasure LOL..   Rump or sirloin are a good cut but you can do this with anything, depends on your budget.  :)|`|bZud91iuaa	Paul: your recipe sounds great and I'm going to try it.      I use a ribeye because this cut soaks up the marinade due to the less dense pack of the meat tissue. (for 2 steaks)    I mix balsamic vinegar 1/2 cup   Olive oil 1/2 cup  Fresh rosemary 1 sprig, leaves only not stem  Fresh garlic 2 cloves  Fresh ground pepper    Add all ingredients to a blender and blend thoroughly. Take your ribeyes and put a little of the marinade in the bottom of the marinade pan, place the steaks in the pan and pour the remaining marinade over the top. Marinate for 1 hour.    Heat your saute' pan with a little oil or butter.  If using butter make sure you don't burn it.  Add the steaks to the pan and sear for 2 minutes per side.  I then transfer the pan to my oven at 400 degrees and cook for 5 min. for MR, 8 min for M and as long as necessary for W, though it should not be served W. But hey, the customer wants it that way?    I pull out the pan and transfer the meat to a platter, cover and let it rest.    Add some chopped garlic to the pan, 2 pats of butter, 2/3 cup good red wine, add back any juice the steak has emitted and cook until reduced by 1/2 and sauce is thick.  Place the sauce in the middle of the plate and lay the ribeye in the center.  If you want you can add a slice of grilled onion and tomato on top of the steak.    A nice Pinot Noir..........and
5zNwBQZHaa	Never thaw at room temperature - just forget that out parents ever did that to us! :-)  It was different back then, we have more possibilities for food borne illness and better knowledge on how to thaw things safely.    Safe fast-thaw options include microwaving or water bath:    You can quickly defrost meat, fish and poultry in the microwave by removing the store wrap, then placing the item on a microwave-safe dish or container. Follow your microwaves instructions for defrosting time, but check occasionally since individual ovens vary.     Another thawing option is cold water. Immerse wrapped meat, fish or poultry in cold water and change it every 30 minutes.     Whenever possible you should plan ahead and thaw in the refrigerator, you can fast-thaw in a pinch.    If you have to fast-thaw, do it the safe way. Never leave meat, fish or poultry on countertops to thaw. Sitting at room temperature for more than two hours increases the risk for foodborne illness.

2f1472ed8347c911938eeda050845b03aa	Results of a recent research :  Organic fertilizers released nutrients more slowly than mineral fertilizers, resulting in decreased S and P concentrations in the leaves, which limited growth and yield in the orgN treatments. Analysis of tomato fruits and plants as well as taste-test results gave no conclusive answer on the relationship between sugar or acid contents in the fruits, macronutrient content of plant leaves and fruits, and perceived taste.   Sugar contents were higher in the fruits given mineral fertilizer, whereas acid contents were higher in the fruits given organic fertilizer. Preference in taste was given to the tomatoes from plants fertilized with the nitrate-dominated nutrient solution and to those given organic fertilizer with extra sulfur. Thus, a reduction in growth, which was expected to lead to a higher concentration of compounds like sugars and acids, did not result in better taste.     Overall, it can be concluded that an appropriate nutrient supply is crucial to reach high yields and good taste.|`|zQbpJmESaa	no difference|`|quUiaHeSaa	Organic tastes better to me especially f you grow vegetables in your own yard or you know and trust someone that does the right thing by organic.

It's hard to say if you get organic food from the market because some organic providers want to tell us it their food taste better just because it cost more in the market.    Last year it was found out that may organic providers use  cow  manure in their crops  and fields for fertilization which does not make it organic any longer.

Q4oPyclQaa	Most chocolate milk is 1% milk fat, which means if you drink the milk only 1% of it is fat.  If your milk container is 250 mL, you'll have 2.5 grams of fat in there.    It's up to you whether that's too much fat or not.    However, I have to say that all those who recommend skim milk are a little off the base.  See, the problem with skim milk is that removing ALL the fat from the milk makes the calcium UNAVAILABLE to your body.  The calcium in milk MUST be consumed with fat for it to be properly absorbed.    Fortunately, whole milk has about the right amount of fat in it so it is properly absorbed.  The less fat you have in the milk, the less nutritional value you will get from it.  Eventually you get to skim milk, which is no good at all.    Now doesn't that mean cream is the BEST?  No, it's not.  Adding MORE fat doesn't help.  It's just that the ideal availability of the calcium is found at the level of fat that whole milk has, which is somewhere between 3 and 5% fat.    Skim milk isn't even good for you AT ALL because you lose pretty much ALL the nutritional value along with that fat.|`|JxCCjH0Uaa	yes...even regular milk has fat in it so get skim milk instead...its healthier.|`|n1D90COxaa	YEP|`|N3bVguIgaa	check the nutritional label.. or drink chocolate soy milk, definitely not that bad :)|`|2n4nCec1aa	It depends.  You can buy low-fat or fat free chocolate milk.  Just read the label.  However, It's still going to be more caloric then regular milk because of the added sugar, even if it's fat-free.  Calories are calories and can make you fat even without fat if you consume too many calories.  Sugar calories are the worst since they're empty calories with no nutritional value or health benefits.|`|pj3gNSN5aa	yes|`|04od7B3uaa	yes...even regular milk has fat in it so get skim milk instead...its healthier

W731o0U5aa	Hey,    Well you could always use milk powder, also known as "Coffee Mate" which is powdered milk.    If you don't have this, the only thing you can do to make a 'good' hot choc, is put 35 teaspoons of hot choc powder (Ovaltine, Milo, Cadbury Drinking Chocolate) in a blender with half boiling water and half cold milk.    Wizz it up and serve it up!    Hope this is yummy enough!|`|HcvfWYkNaa	2 cups of milk aint even gonna help to serve 35 people unless you were serving them in super small tiny cups. you might as well just buy those quick hot chocolate mixes that you just need to add water to.     if you're using nesquik or cocoa, you really just need to go buy some milk. not that hard.|`|PrarLmbxaa	The store sells swiss miss hot cocoa packs for like $1 I don't know how many are in each box, but it's cheap.  So heat up the water you are usuing, put the cocoa mix in the cup first, then put a sprinkle of sugar.  THen squirt some chocolate syrup in.  Pour the hot water in and stir well, top that off with Land O Lakes whip cream, it has a creamy quality to is and when it melts into the hot cocoa makes it really great!  Eat with a chocolate cookie or biscotti!

Mine has lasted me a bit over a year so far and it still looks brand new.  They are also very reasonably price.  I believe mine was $4 or $5.  They have various types; mine is hard, thick plastic and it's insulated like the Tervis Tumblers, so it doesn't get water drops on the outside.  It also comes with a clip, so it can clip onto your backpack or bag.

O0AfxH9Eaa	When I make corn soup I boil an onion and a potato in a pint of milk, add most of the corn, puree it and add a bit of whole corn, then season. It's good.|`|AA10723688	Amazing Corn Chowder :  (.. the original recipe calls for a strip of bacon, but you can add a little bacon fat instead, if you have some on hand, or just add a little more butter)  -serves 4-    1 Tbsp unsalted butter  1 strip of bacon or 1 teaspoon of bacon fat (substitute 1/2 Tbsp of butter for vegetarian option)  1/2 large yellow onion, chopped (about 1/2 cup)  1/2 large carrot, chopped (about 1/3 cup)  1/2 celery stalk, chopped (about 1/3 cup)  3 ears of sweet corn, kernels removed from the cobs (about 2 cups), cobs reserved (see steps for taking corn off the cob)  1 bay leaf  3 1/2 cups milk, whole or low fat  1 medium Yukon Gold potato, or Russet, peeled and diced  1/4 red bell pepper, chopped (about 1/4 cup)  Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper   1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves    how to:  1).  In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the bacon strip (skip this step for vegetarian option, just add more butter) and fry until the bacon renders its fat, but doesn't begin to brown, 3 or 4 minutes. Add the onion and saut for 4 to 5 minutes, until soft. Add the carrot and celery and cook for 4 or 5 more minutes.    2).  Break the corn cobs in half and add them to the saucepan. Add the milk and bay leaf. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to a bare simmer. Cover the pot and cook for 30 minutes. Make sure the heat is as low as can be and still maintain a gentle simmer (on our stove we had to use the "warm" setting) to prevent scalding the milk on the bottom of the pan.    3).  Discard the cobs, the bacon strip, and the bay leaf. Raise the heat, add the potatoes, red pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt, fresh ground pepper to taste, bring to a simmer and reduce the heat to maintain a simmer for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are almost fork tender.    4).  Raise the heat, add the corn kernels and the thyme. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes.    ** Serve with fresh coriander leaves sprinkled on top... :)      ``|`|zQbpJmESaa	Soup:   3 cups whole milk   3 ears of fresh corn, kernels cut from cobs, cobs broken in half and reserved   2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter   1 large onion, chopped   1 large carrot, peeled, thinly sliced   1 celery stalk, thinly sliced   1 garlic clove, pressed   2 cups water   2 large fresh thyme sprigs   2 fresh rosemary sprigs   1 bay leaf   Ground white pepper  http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/v...
dDDBZAsJaa	Here are a couple of easy soup recipes:    Take 7 cups of water and 8 beef bouillon cubes and bring to a boil in a soup pan.  Add linguica, veggies such as carrots, corn, green beans, and spinach (or whatever veggies you like) and potatoes.  Let it cook for another 10-15 minutes.  You can make this soup with ground beef or turkey also.  You should cook the meat first, in this case, to get it browned before adding the water and bouillon cubes, and don't add the linguica.    You can also make a chicken soup where you combine 7 cups of water and 8 bouillon cubes and bring it to a boil.   I take chicken, whether it's leftover chicken that I have made from a whole chicken (and cut the extra chicken off of), or canned chicken breast, or boneless skinless chicken breasts or tenderloins, and put it in the boiling broth.  (If it's chicken breasts or tenderloins, you don't have to cut it until the soup is done, and the chicken is white all the way through).  I put either rice or noodles and veggies (I use frozen green beans, corns, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, but you can use whatever you have on hand and like.) Of course, you can add regular white buttered bread, or garlic bread to the meal to dip in the soup.

Jy15drCtaa	There are so many in New York City that it would be tough to narrow down for you. There is the Ramen Setagaya in the East Village, Ichi Raku in Brooklyn (Sheepshead bay area) Zen, also in the Village, Katana in Queens (flushing area) just to name a few. I have personally been to all of the above named restaurants and can recommend them all. Personally though, Zen has excellent service, and costs a little less than the others.
