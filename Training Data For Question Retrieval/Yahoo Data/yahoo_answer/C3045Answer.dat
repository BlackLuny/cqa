PDotv2Hsaa	You are right to note that the amount is very small. I would save more first and then invest some in stocks (if you have the experience and know-how) to grow the money further. When it reaches at least a five-figure sum, I'd then think about going into business.|`|0f644b00eccc311534ab8fe88a3eb455aa	i would pay for my college tuition. it's getting quite pricey here at California, so i'd do that.<br>  if you want to start a business, i'd say invest it on a small company and/or stocks.

GkK44x4Raa	Unless your diabetes is going to affect your ability to do the day to day functions of the job, I don't see why there would be any need to tell your potential employer about it up front.  Usually when they ask about your health, they are interested in things that could hinder your ability to come in to work and perform the job.  If you manage your diabetes well with little problems in illness and hospitilization, I would make sure to emphasize the fact with any employer who may, for whatever reason, need to know about it up front.<br>  To find jobs, visit betterchattanoogajobs.com, the tennesse department of labor, and search on craigslist.

2693c12e2430d8cbe7d34e9665ac8866aa	Many organizations look for volunteers that are at least 14, 16 in some places.  You may want to check with your religious organization. They may need volunteers to help with the younger children during classes. Another possibility would be to help a mother with small children; that would give her experience so that she could later babysit. She may also be able to help an elderly neighbor or relative doing small chores around the house. <br>  <br>  Once she is 14 she could check with your local library or hospital. <br>  <br>  Library Lady<br>  Librarians - the Ultimate Search Engines
