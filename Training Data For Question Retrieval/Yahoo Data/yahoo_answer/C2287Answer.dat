VZ21gL81aa	any subject that gets you published is a good subject.    and BTW, that is NOT an obvious thing......|`|pQ3fzgjBaa	Well some sociologists do research obvious things, but usually they do so to get factual proof even though they may already know the results of their study beforehand. They do this because if one were to simply say "yeah, of course waitresses prefer men in business suits because they tip better" of course everyone knows that's true. But anyone could disagree with it for any reason and without research, you'd have nothing to back up your claims.    But most sociological experiments go much deeper than that topic.  Sociologists have proven many things to be true that go unnoticed to others. Sociologists have to have a keen eye and observe the little things in society that most pay no attention to.     A lot of times they do monotonous research such as the one you mentioned just to have some sort of proof that they're doing something and in the meantime are working on much bigger and more ground-breaking research.

oVxr5B3Eaa	You can likely spend a 1/2 of a page just defining optimism and pessimism, so I would start with that. Introduction and conclusion could also be about 1/4 to 1/3 of a page as well. Introduction should introduce all the topics you will talk about, use your body to talk about the actual content (one paragraph of definitions, some examples of optimism, examples of pessimism, and then why one is dominant), then conclude with an overview of what you just talked about. I would come up with examples, as many as you can, relate them to real world events. Branch off from the main topic slightly, just say EVERYTHING you can about each point and you should have no problem.|`|jMJVW7bcaa	It would help to know which work you are talking about :). Anyway, ask  yourself how you feel about the book.  Do you think it is negative or positive?  Then ask yourself why you think that the book is positive or negative, and create a thesis statement with this points.  Support your points with examples from the text.  For instance, you may start a sentence, This point is clearly illustrated when Character X states to Character Y, "Blah blah."  Make clear citations with your work and you should be fine in your length.  In your paragraphs, always go back to the main idea that you stated in your thesis statement.  In short, show why the book is positive or negative.  For details on how to create a thesis statement, see below.|`|XeR3oN0aaa	Hi.  I am a GCSE student and have to write a ton of essays.  I find that a really good way to structure it is to use a specific order and stick to it so all the paragraphs are as informative and detailed as they can be and no points can be missed.  The method I use follows;   - S - s stands for statement.  this would be what your paragraph is about i.e. the point you are going to then continue to explain.  For example if your essay question were 'How does Shakespeare present aspects of love in Romeo and Juliet?' and your paragraph was going to be about the sonnet form you might say 'the sonnet form is used at numerous points throughout the play to indicate a presence of true or genuine love'.   - E - e stands for evidence.  It is always importante (particually in literature essays) to use quotations from the text to support your point.  Following my previous example for evidence you might say 'A prime example of the use of the sonnet form is in act 1 scene 5 when Romeo demonstrates a sense of true love by moving into a sonnet about Juliet' (and use quotations).  Sometimes in literature essays it may be neccessary to give page references usuallly in brackets or as footnotes.   - X - finally the X stands for (kind of) explaination.  It is important to explain why your evidence and statement are relevent in terms of the question.  Following the previous example you might say something like 'Therefore Shakespeare shows an aspect of true love through the use of the sonnet form@ etc.  Introductions and conclusions are really essential in essays so make sure it is strong (particually the conclusion as this is the last thing the examiner reads).  if you are asked compare or give more than one side to a question/text/event/argument then always do this i the conclusion.  If you are stuck for ideas about the text try just mindmapping different points that relate to the question.  E.g. list all the ways in which it could be optimistic and then all the ways in which it could be pessimistic.  You can always add evidence and explaination later.  As I said I am only a student so am no expert but this is just tips I have picked up over my school life but for me it is really useful and I find it really easy to write essays when I follow this method.  I hope this has helped and the best of luck with your essay!|`|mm1kfE7Qaa	..By writing 3-5 pages.    Give lots of examples to support your argument for whether the book is Optimistic or Pessimistic.
1oJtJCaWaa	Here are the changes I would make:        Even though this site is entertaining, I did find some flaws.  Not all the games will load on the site, but they do give you an email to use if you cant get the site to work. I emailed the website and was disappointed that five days later I didnt receive a return email. Looking at the site with a critical eye, I started to realize that the site is enjoyable to use but doesnt have a lot of solid information or reputable sources. The games are fun but not all of them are clear on content and what the student is actually learning. The site does not complete the depth of information related to the topic it claims to cover. It briefly touches on a lot of subjects but doesnt fully cover algebra or geometry. At first discovery of the site, I actually assumed it was for elementary students and after more research I discovered it was geared to ages thirteen and above. Although some of the games are too hard for a student under the age of thirteen, some of the other games are way too young and immature for a student of that age. The site has a lot of links but some of these links are not related to math and took me off my path of looking for good mathematic information. The site does express good points about not gettting stressed out, but it links to beach relaxing scenes which I dont think relates to a student of thirteen years old.   This website seemed very fun and different at first but after more critical thinking about the site, I realized this site would be extremely hard for a thirteen year old to maneuver. The site doesnt have complete and relevant topics about mathematics. Some of the games do not make sense nor do they apply the correct mathematical information as they claim. I personally would not direct a student to just use or view this site, but it does have some relevant and fun information on it.

R1LvhhTeaa	Robin Hood is a sort of history.  A fairy tale is often a cautionary tale of some sort - a story of the people - something which interests common people - a 'how-too' story.  There's usually a girl who's in danger of being raped (eaten alive) by some Big Bad Wolf guy.     The girl can be in danger of losing her first born son - as in Rumpelstiltskin.    At the end there's resolution - Rumpelstiltskin's name is revealed and he stamps his feet so hard he falls through the earth.  The Big Bad Wolf is killed by a more pleasant sexual partner - the hunter.  And he cuts open the Big Bad Wolf and out comes Grandmother too (I think).    Anyway - take a look at the common elements in a few official fairly tales and then just recombine them.  Goldy Locks becomes "The Blond" and she's trying to get into show business - and she goes to the house of the Three Producers - Father, Mother and Baby Producer....|`|St4Pbko9aa	Well, I don't know what fairy tales you know or would prefer, but here are a few ideas:  Hansel and Gretel  Cinderella  Snow White  Robin Hood would be a good choice, as you said  If you're really unsure of what to do, watch the movies "A Cinderella Story" or "Sydney White" for ideas. Notice how the movies use main points from the story to create kind of an alternate reality. I think you'll get some fun ideas after seeing one of those two.  Hope this helps, and good luck!|`|3149d8c79c2c2fd573c8fb1acb44e350aa	Sounds great. Play the What If game.  What if Robin Hood didn't give to the poor what he took from the rich but instead kept it for himself. How would his merry men have felt about that.   How did the merry men feel about giving away all the loot? What if the merry men started robbing Robin, how would Robin feel. Bet you can come up with plenty of good tales from this.   Good luck with your assignment.|`|2FudsFrHaa	How can you have a real fairy tale? It's a fairy tale.  To me Robin Hood is more of a fictional story than a fairy tale, as it involves realistic characters doing realistic things.  I believe a fairy tale needs fantastic (fantasy) characters and/or supernatural powers. an example would be Rumpelstiltskin, who could spin wool in to gold, or The Three Little Pigs, with pigs who can use tools and know construction, or any where princes turn into toads, or unicorns and evil witches casting spells.   How about using Cinderella, but instead of having a pumpkin turn into a chariot, you could have her tricycle turn into a stagecoach, and she has until midnight to go back in time and rescue the charming sheriff from an evil witch (who is actually her evil stepmother).|`|2hAuIg5baa	you could make it funny like use the same idea but robin hood could be an alchoholic or a transvestite or really dumb or something, the merry men could be gay or incredibly stupid, just have lots of fun with it :)
A96W1WVCaa	Every state needs a history teacher. Mainly the ones that require Goverment & Econ for graduation, which I believe is almost all states.

Don't write down the whole speech because it won't sound natural.  Instead, think about things that you want to mention and write key words down on prompt cards.

He learns many story's such as "HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED" but chris died of starvation in the middle of the Wild on his  Great Alaskan Adventure (walked into the wild and lived there in a abandoned bus for over 100 days)  All in all he spent over 2 years traveling, although he died, and he only realized what truly mattered when it was too late, he never the less discovered what truly mattered and lived life rather then not doing the things he loved.

38161f73751d32a516bc161696646fedaa	Depends on the needs in the area.  My son goes to an afterschool "homework club" at his school.  It is great because it gives him a chance to get homework done before coming home (and if he forgot a book or anything he's still at school!!).  Find out what needs will fit the kids; if you live in a rural community (poverty area/high population of second language learners) it is most likely they could really use help with homework (since most of those parents won't be able to help them).  In some areas kids just need a safe place to hang out for a while after school.  Here's an idea (from the school I used to work at): have some teachers open their rooms up for kids to do homework (ie: math room, english room, ect) and for kids who don't need help with homework they can participate in "Open Gym" where another staff member can monitor in the gymnasium|`|f39faba138d31987f78525ef596325aaaa	i dont knwo the age but deffenetly something constructive to pass the time. and it would have to be a mixture. the more choices the beter. not all learning and not all fun.|`|5fc0dfeb5ec87b0c30bcb07bbd74a909aa	eewwww they learn enough in school i wouold make it fun active activities. sports , hobbies, crafts, feild trips|`|AA11449091	I'd definitely have homework time and tutoring time.... pair older students up with younger students.

Books and story time would be a must, as well.    I wouldn't necessarily want to have a "curriculum" - remember they've been in school all day.  By the time they come to you their brains are pretty tired.

JSwvmjk7aa	Physical fitness is a tremendously important topic for school aged children today. These classes stress the importance of a healthy, active lifestyle that has become crucial now more than ever. With kids living a sedentary lifestyle and eating unhealthy diets, physical fitness should be a top priority in schools across this country. Unfortunately, due to budgetary constraints, many school districts are forced to drastically cut or completely eliminate this part of education.    It's best to teach them young. If children learn proper physical fitness education they will build healthy habits for the rest of their lives. These physical education classes provide basic fitness knowledge and information about sports and athletic events and also impart health instruction in many school districts.     Health classes inform kids about the ins and outs of the human body, basic development, sexual education, and first aid training. If these topics are not taught in todays schools, who will inform the next generation about these things? Physical fitness education is much more than playing dodge ball and other organized sports. Physical fitness education is about improving a childs overall quality of life.    The President's Physical Fitness program is one of the classic aspects of any physical education class. Children receive a certificate of achievement after they complete a series of tasks set by a Presidential panel. It is a matter of pride to receive this certificate. It shows kids of all ages and skill levels they can accomplish a goal.     Gone are the days when children walked or biked to school. Now, physical fitness education is the only means of exercise for many children in this country. These days, children are driven to school by a parent, car pool, or bus. In school they sit in a classroom, and at home they sit in their room and play video games, surf the internet, or watch television. The only physical activity they do during the whole week is in the physical education classes.     It's your duty to raise your voice when you hear of plans to discontinue physical fitness education program in your child's school. Talk about it to the Parent and Teacher Association or at a meeting of the school board. Try to suggest ways and means and offer alternatives, but make sure that the school continues with the programs without alteration.     The common notion that Physical Fitness Education is not as important as the other subjects is absolutely incorrect. In fact, it is much more important since it provides the only physical activity and a base of knowledge for children beginning their healthy lives.     It is always good to motivate your child for taking part in various extra curricular activities. Set a fitness schedule for your child and make him head towards healthy living. Never forget that a child learns from adults, so you have to serve as a role model for him. Show him to live life the healthy way, by doing so yourself.|`|7uc0PCbnaa	FOLLOWING ARE FEW POINTS--------  1 HE CAN TALK ABOUT THE NO OF PEOPLE SUFFERING  FROM OBESITY.  2 HE CAN WRITE ABOUT THE FAULTY DIET OF PEOPLE  3 HE CAN WRITE THAT THE MOTHER OF MANY DISEASES IS OBESITY  4 HE CAN WRITE THAT PHYSICAL EX HELP A PERSON TO REMAIN HEALTHY AND CREATE A GOOD ENVIRONMENT FOR THEIR FAMILY.  5  HE CAN ADD ABOUT LACK OF INTREST OF CHILDREN IN PHYSICAL EX AND ITS CONSEQUENCES

The Filipinos brought the brightly colored fighting cocks, and Walla, the wild chickens.

On a recent trip to Tahiti, the same wild chickens were everywhere as well, so I question this theory. But why so many??"|`|c64f66096640221b0762d74e09be96dfaa	I can't get into the whole truth in this little space. In brief, the aliens implanted tracking devices in natives about twenty thousand years ago and returned with a new species, which failed to survive on their own planet, and resembled a chicken. Every few hundred years, the aliens returned to check the progress of their experiments. With their advanced technology, they were able to successfully breed in captivity the first human-chicken cross breed. It was a tall yellow bird that was able to speak. Later, the natives made the tall yellow bird into a god, but found that it really only asked annoying questions, but no one could ever catch it. They believed that people could only see where it had been. In later generations they believed that this tall yellow bird was actually afraid of people and so the representations in their mythology also changed to a short, clucking, largely flightless bird, whose eggs were edible. The aliens returned to the island about two thousand years ago and were disappointed to see their creation so profaned, so they uttered a curse upon the island and called it "Ch-en" in their alien tongue. The islanders had enough of alien intrusion in their history and decided to re-name everything the aliens had tried to successfully create, including names.

Observa los errores que tienes:    1) Intencin, que est ms que clara. Disculpa si m acento se escribe al revs es que tengo problemas con m compu, pero t me entiendes.  2) lo del "porqu" que alguien te dijo por ah que estaba mal escrito, no es incorrecto, porque no ests haciendo una pregunta sino ests dando una razn acerca de algo, osea lo ests usando como el ncleo de una estructura( oracin, objeto directo, etc...).   3)  "solo" se escribe con acento en la O, Slo, porque solo sin acento, denota que una persona est sola, de soledad y con acento denota lo siguiente: nicamente, solamente.  4) otra cosita, la palabra "minimamente" no es correcta, lo correcto y me imagino que eso fue lo que quisiste escribir, es Mnimo.    Mmm mira no todos somos perfectos y cometemos errores pero no puedes cambiar las cosas, hay personas que se molestan porque las corriges y eso es lo peor del caso, yo por  ejemplo tengo problema con el Dequesmo, me ha costado solucionarlo, pero ya ves, como t dices hay que seguir aprendiendo, pero te aconsejo que no te pongas a corregir si la que tiene que corregirse antes eres t, ya ves que te ganas los insultos de los dems y no creo que eso te haga sentir bien.    saludos    BYE|`|x6JPH5Rlaa	Guena idea Fernanda ,comienza usando tu el corrector|`|JpyTk27uaa	Ya que vas de "erudita" aprende a escribir mejor.

Respuestas...    Ese fue un error educacional, porque es el trabajo de maestros y profesores incentivarnos a escribir bien...    Tengo 12 a?os y mis amigas escriben muy mal... Yo tampoco soy perfecta, pero mis errores no estn precisamente en la ortografa... (matemticas) La cuestin es que a ellas les da lo mismo escribir bien o mal... Sus carpetas son un desastre y cuando las corrijo me dicen: "Maylin no me jodas" (??). Lo peor es que no les importa! Me da tanta impotencia porque les explico las reglas y me canso de explicrselas, y no les importa!!    Mi hermanito de 11 tiene el mismo problema, mi mam se siente como yo, ella, con su autoridad (a m no me escuchara, les repito ??no les importa!!) le hace escribir dos renglones de cada palabra mal escrita y al principio va bien... pero luego de escribirla 5 veces vuelve a tener el mismo error!! Yo ya no lo puedo creer...    Creo, que como ya dije antes, el problema de mi hermano radica en la educacin. Vivo en Argentina, y el a?o pasado, mi hermano iba a 5o a?o de la primaria. Su profesora de Lengua era una inepta que ??tampoco le importaba!! la ortografa de sus alumnos. La echaron por un error muy grave que cometi con un ni?ito (le pidi que se bajara los pantalones para ver si era hombre o mujer, el pobre ni?o slo tena amigas mujeres). Ahora, en 6o, la profesora de NATURALES cada error, por ms mnimo que sea (una tilde, por ejemplo) lo circula con birome verde y le pide como tarea dos renglones de cada palabra.    Obvio, est el problema de los padres, hay cada uno...  Conozco padres que le hacen la tarea a sus hijos, hijos que NECESITAN la ayuda de los padres para sentarse a estudiar... No es por presumir, pero soy una de las mejores de la clase, pero porque siempre me gust leer (por eso mis pocas faltas ortogrficcas) y nunca mi mam tuvo que ayudarme a estudiar, y sin embargo, yo llegaba a la escuela con todas mis tareas ordenadas y prolijas en mi carpeta.    Y vuelvo al tema de mi hermano... El necesita a mi mam para estudiar, porque sino simplemente NO lo hace... El no estudia su mi mam no est presente, no hace nada sin ella! Claro, no hay manera de hacerle entender que cuando est en la universidad, mam no se va a mudar con l para ayudarlo a estudiar...    Todo est en manos de maestros y profesores dedicados y padres que no malcren a sus hijos...

0d1ae0db1546b90ea5b6c6621e59aae9aa	De acuerdo, primero de todo vamos a plantear las ecuaciones, de acuerdo?  A tiene 18 a?os ms que B:  A=B+18  Hace 18 a?os la edad de A era 4/2 la edad de B  hace 18 a?os A tenia  A-18; y B tenia B-18; entonces:  A -18=4/2(B-18)  cogemos el valor de A obtenido en la primera ecuacin y lo sustituimos en la segunda, de acuerdo?  B + 18 - 18 = 4/2(B - 18)  ahora tenemos una ecuacin con una incognita, podemos resolver. Como? Poniendo las incognitas a un lado del igual y los nmeros a otro. ( antes vamos a operar el parentesis, ok? Piensa que 4/2= 2!!)  B + 18-18=2(B-18)  B=2B-36  Pasamos los nmeros a la izquierda del igual ( para que quede positivo), y las incognitas a la derecha, de tal modo que obtenemos lo siguiente:  36=2B-B  Operamos y vemos:  36 = B  sustituimos el valor encontrado en la primera incognita  A=B+18  A=36+18  Y obtenemos que A= 54  ( Yo para ayudarme a plantear las ecuaciones, q acostumbra a ser lo mas dificil, intento imaginarmelo, por ejemplo, si me dicen que mi hermana tiene 7 a?os ms que yo, me lo imagino, si yo tengo 18 a?os, ella tendr 18 + 7, es decir 25.)

Secondo me se la psicologia ti piace cos tanto dovresti provare a iscriverti anche perch se ci sono psicologi disoccupati (dove vivo io non mi sembra proprio ma magari da altre parti si) lo studio  sempre una buona cosa e la psicologia ti aiuta in tanti campi, a partire dalle relazioni sociali in generale (e sopratutto se hai dei figli!!!). A prescindere da questo, essendo che da noi c' anche un corso di formazione a distanza, mi hanno detto persone che lo hanno "frequentato", che perdi tantissimo tempo a guardarti le lezioni (come se frequentassi perch il numero di ore  quasi lo stesso!!) e quindi conviene di pi iscriverti ad un corso normale di psicologia e dare esami senza frequentare (come hanno fatto loro). nel caso ti interessasse esistono corsi di counseling anche per non psicologi che ti abilitano a fare colloqui di counseling senza iscriverti all'universit! un ultimo consiglio.. se ti iscrivi all'universit ti conviene fare il part-time!! ciao e in bocca al lupo!!|`|mL8JYvd2aa	dove vorresti iscriverti a milano? san raffaele? cattolica? bicocca? ti conviene informarti bene sull'obbligo di frequenza, in bicocca di sicuro c' per alcuni laboratori, nelle altre 2 non ti so dire. credo comunque che se non c' l'obbligo fi frequenza di molte ore grazie ai permessi studio riuscirai ad organizzarti e fare ci che ti interessa!|`|OnbG0lMYaa	Ciao, io studio psicologia a Milano-Bicocca e posso dirti che studiare e lavorare assieme  veramente dura. Molti miei amici hanno rinunciato al lavoro proprio per la mole di pagine da studiare. La frequenza non  obbligatoria, sebbene sia consigliata: molti prof, specie nel campo di psicologia sociale, spiegano molto bene, riducendo in tal modo la fatica di apprendere. Inoltre, se vuoi venire alla Bicocca, tieni a mente che tutta la facolt  estremamente incentrata su fattori biologici e anatomo-fisiologici cerebrali e, in generale, su apporti scientifici piuttosto che psicodinamici. Non essendo interessata al counselling non saprei dirti molto su questo indirizzo, ma un problema  l'accesso alla laurea specialistica in psicologia clinica: circa l'80% degli studenti si iscrive a psicologia per seguire un percorso in ambito clinico, e entrare in graduatoria per la specialistica, essendo a numero chiuso,  veramente una lotta. Requisiti fondamentali sono, seppur discutibili, una buona media e laurea triennale ottenuta in corso. Spero non averti scoraggiata! Ma se pu interessarti, in Bicocca  stato istituito un corso di laurea a distanza progetto Nettuno in psicologia proprio per chi lavora tanto. Prova ad informarti.  Buona fortuna

L'espressione Belle poque (L'epoca bella, I bei tempi) nacque in Francia prima della prima guerra mondiale per definire il periodo immediatamente anteriore (1885- 1914). Essa nasce in parte da una realt storica (fu davvero un periodo di sviluppo, spensieratezza, fede nel progresso) e in parte da un sentimento di nostalgia. Il trauma della guerra aveva infatti portato a idealizzare la realt.    Dalla fine dell'Ottocento in poi le invenzioni e progressi della tecnica erano stati all'ordine del giorno. I benefici che queste scoperte avevano portato nella vita delle persone erano diventate sempre pi visibili: illuminazione di case e strade, servizi igienici, minore paura di affrontare la malattia e l'ignoto. Tutto questo aveva determinato un profondo ottimismo sulle possibilit dell'uomo, a cui niente sembrava precluso.    In questa descrizione c' un fondo di verit (l'espansione, economica e non solo, l'assenza di preoccupazioni o comunque una certa forma di noncuranza, il periodo di pace tra la Francia stessa e i suoi vicini europei, la fede nel progresso...) e una parte di nostalgia. La realt era in effetti stata abbellita anche per non risentire troppo dei traumi postbellici. Ma, senza meno, questo periodo  in Francia ricordato come un passato dorato che fu ridotto in frantumi dallo scoppio della guerra, mentre art nouveau fu uno stile artistico, diffuso in Europa e negli Stati Uniti, che interess le arti figurative, l'architettura e le arti applicate, tra il 1890 e la prima guerra mondiale.    Il movimento, conosciuto internazionalmente soprattutto con la denominazione francofona, assume localmente nomi diversi, ma dal significato di fondo affine, tra i quali: Style Guimard, Style 1900 o Scuola di Nancy (Francia), Stile Liberty, dal nome dei magazzini inglesi propriet di Arthur Lasenby Liberty, che vendevano oggetti Art Noveau, o Stile Floreale in Italia, Modern Style in Gran Bretagna, Jugendstil ("Stile giovane") in Germania, Nieuwe Kunst nei Paesi Bassi, Styl M?odej Polski (Stile di Giovane Polonia) in Polonia, Style sapin in Svizzera, Sezessionstil (Stile di secessione, vedi la secessione viennese) in Austria, Modern in Russia e Arte Modernista o Modernismo in Spagna che meglio ne caratterizza l'aspetto internazionale.

bK2ghzPjaa	Le mtier de prof est difficile  plusieurs niveaux. D'abord parce que permettre  un lve d'apprendre, ?a ne s'improvise pas et on ne peut plus aujourd'hui se contenter de "dverser" des connaissances en laissant les lves se dbrouiller avec. Ensuite, c'est difficile parce que avoir 28 ados devant soi est une exprience en soi ! Ce mtier fait certes appel  des techniques mais il fait galement appel  des motions qu'on gre plus ou moins. Nous ne sommes pas des machines aprs tout.  La notation des profs par les inspecteurs tait jusqu' aujourd'hui rare et alatoire mais il semblerait que les choses changent : inspections plus frquentes ET avec des objectifs plus professionnels : amener le professeur  s'interroger sur ses pratiques, proposer des formations... ce qui me semble plut?t constructif.   Concernant la notation des profs par les lves, je suis d'accord avec ceux qui disent qu'ils n'ont pas la maturit et le recul pour le faire. Mais j'ajouterai : noter selon quelles critres ? le degr de sympathie ? la tte du client ?   Un prof note un TRAVAIL pas la personne (ou devrait en tout cas). L'lve est mal plac pour juger du travail (qu'ils commencent par arriver o nous sommes avant de juger) et je ne vois pas l'intrt de juger la personne.  CQFD|`|O0uoeiWdaa	chacun son tour!!!  lol mais n'y donnons pas plus d'importance ni de valeur que ?a en a !!!|`|H2cQ5XWjaa	Moi, je suis contre car les profs ne sont pas des animaux en cage  qui il faudrait donner des cacahutes  chaque fois qu'ils font un petit tour !!  Je pense qu'ils font leur job, mais qu'on leur cherche trop les poux a vouloir les noter !!  On dirait que prof est devenu une sous-classe sociale !! On les denigre  longueur de temps !!  Surtout de l  les noter, je trouve ca scandaleux !!  D'accord, certains proffesseurs sont durs et pas trop sociables, mais bon il faut voir galement le caractere bien tremp des eleves lol en fait chacun a sa part de rsponsabilits mais il faut pas que ca dgnre en un conflit de gnrations qui passe par les coups et les armes !!    De toute maniere, jai lu que le site notetobe.fr ou l'on pouvait noter les profs a t desactiv et interdit par l'Assemble Nationale, pas plus tard qu'hier !!|`|643a6aff42f71792ae0f6f3dc8bad360aa	Je serai plut?t pour si la note est argumente. Ceci afin d'viter un "sete salaupe ma mi un zreau an ortografe, jeu lui met aussi un". Avec donc vrification des commentaires. Ca demande beaucoup de travail mais la crdibilit du systme est  ce prix.  Des mauvais profs, j'en ai eut. L'argument comme quoi ils vous leur vie  notre instruction est totalement utopique. J'en connais un paquet qui n'en ont rien  foutre de leurs lves qui ont vraiment besoin d'eux. A l'autre extrme, des excellents profs, j'en ai eut aussi. Des profs qui aimaient changer et organisaient ce qu'il fallait pour aider les lves en difficult  rviser plus efficacement. Et ce systme permet aussi de valoriser leur travail.

Ce que je dis, moi, c'est que personne n'est parfait, mais ce n'est certainement pas aux lves d'en juger. Il y a dj la hirarchie pour cela.   Mais enfin rflchis un peu ! Tu es en train de cder  la tentation de satisfaire ta petite vengeance personnelle et tes petites frustrations d'ancien lve...  Crois-tu vraiment qu'un ado de 15 ans puisse avoir la maturit, le recul et l'honntet intellectuelle pour se permettre un jugement ? anonyme qui plus est ? Crois-tu que cette note serait motive par la raison, ou la passion, le dsir de vengeance ? Un lve d'environ 15 ans est encore un "enfant", qui a besoin d'tre "cadr", "duqu" ! Il serait dangereux de lui faire croire qu'il a du "pouvoir" sur les adultes qui l'encadrent !

Aprs qu'ils donnent leur avis, objectivement ou pas, quelle importance.

Mais bon sinon ton analyse est ok|`|tkdtMdMraa	La qualit de l'enseignement par beaucoup d'enseignants -surtout du public- est une honte. Il y a certes des bons profs, mais les mauvais sont en plus grand nombre que ce que l'on laisse toujours entendre.    J'ai moins de 30ans, j'ai fait dans ma scolarit 3coles primaire, 3 collges, 2 Lyces, 1prpa, 2 universits et 1 Grande cole donc je pense avoir eu plus de prof de l'EN dans ma vie que beaucoup de gens. Tout ?a dans 6 dpartements donc j'ai vu du pays.    A tous les niveaux on a des profs qui se savent intouchables et qui en branlent pas une dans le meilleur des cas et qui dans le pire peuvent aliner leurs lves.      Quelques exemples :    -Prof d'histoire en 6eme en arrt maladie d'une semaine une semaine sur 2. Comme l'arrt ne dure pas assez longtemps, il n'y a jamais de rempla?ant. Du coup nombre d'heures annuelles divises par deux. Vridique et sans xagration. Je n'ai jamais entendu parler de Rome et de la Grce par exemple -si les programmes ont pas chang, ?a devrait vous parler-.    -Prof de fran?ais en 5eme qui n'a absoluement rien respect du programme ("Enfant" de Jules Vals ou Pomes de Ronsard tudis en cours par exemple). Du coup la cohrence de l'enseignement au collge tombe par terre et de grosses lacunes dans les classiques.    -Prof de fran?ais en 4eme qui faisait des fautes d'orthographe en quantit (sic)    -Prof d'histoire en seconde imbu de sa personne et qui faisait plus de clientlisme qu'un homme politique (ton pre peut m'avoir des tarifs pour ?a ? Ah non alors tant pis pour ta note). Abus de pouvoir clairs.    -Prof de LV1 en 1ere qui ne se lavait pas -odeur insoutenable mme au fond de la classe- qui hurlait d'une voix stridante ds que l'on posait une question et qui traitait ses lves d'oies capitalistes consumristes voues  la misre et  la dcadence -et en fran?ais en plus, pas dans la langue tudie-, au final 10minutes de la langue tudie par squence.  On s'est pleint de la "chose" au CPE , au directeur et au directeur adjoint avec enregistrement audio en preuve et la rponse fut claire : "A part s'il y a pdophilie on ne peut rien faire, donc si l'un de vous veut se dvouer et passer un mauvais moment pour le bien de tous".    -Prof de math en prpa qui bouffait ses mots, qui ne vrifiait pas que les sons qui sortaient de sa bouche taient des mots, et qui crivait comme un porc comme s'il faisait la course.    -Prof de Sciences industrielles en prpa qui jouait la montre, c'est  dire qu'il arrivait avec 15min de retard, repartait avec 15min d'avance et faisait une pause entre chacune de ses actions. Exemple : Je prends la craie -pause de 10s- je la colle au tableau -pause de 10s-  j'cris une phrase - pause....    -en vrac :  Le verre de rouge sur la table, les critiques de la famille (une prof qui sort  une fille "conne comme ta mre..."), jur aux assises pendant 1 mois sans aucun rempla?ant, les copies du mois d'octobre rendues en mai !, les copies perdues dans l'avion en Egypte( c'est clair que du haut des pyramides c'est classique d'emmener ses copies  corriger), les copies rendues sans anotation (et on me rpond texto "la correction dtaille ne fait pas partie de la mthode pdagogique que j'ai choisi")...    Tout cela je l'ai vcu de mes yeux !    Toutes ces racailles me font penser que si ce genre d'initiative pouvait empcher ces merdes d'exercer ou au moins les pousser  se remettre en question, alors elles sont bonnes  prendre.    @La rousse.  J'ai dit que javais moins de 30ans. Si tu veux les annes, j'tais en 6eme en 1991/1992 3eme en 1994/1995 en terminale en 1997/1998.     Faire de cas particuliers des gnralits n'est jamais une bonne chose, mais toi -ou "vous" je ne sais pas ;)- qui es prof de math, tu devrais comprendre que quand on dit que les profs sont dans leurs crasante majorit des bon profs en dehors de quelques moutons noirs et que je te donne l'exemple d'une mutlitude successive d'tablissements que j'ai frquent il n'y a pas tant de temps que ?a, tablissements pas trop mal rputs d'ailleurs, o pour chaque anne de ma scolarit je peux te donner deux ou trois exemples d'abus caractriss, il n'est pas dur que conclure qu' un sondage avec un chantillon de taille importante peut au moins faire office de contre exemple sur le lieux commun "les mauvais profs sont rares"    Et de plus j'ai eu tous types d'tablissements -hors ZUP- priv et public, en ville et  la campagne, et dans les dpartements 29, 72, 67, 95, 92 et 75. Donc si ce n'tait qu'un problme local je l'aurais vu qu'une fois, ce qui n'est pas le cas.    Pour te prouver que mes anecdotes ne sont pas inventes, je pourrais te citer les noms des profs et leur tablissement -et tu pourrais vrifier sur Note2be quand il aura gagn l'appel- mais comme c'est justement le dbat, je ne le fais pas.    Mais c'est s?r qu'il est toujours plus facile quand on est prof de se voiler la face et de penser que "tout le monde il est beau, tout le monde il est gentil" ....sauf les lves bien s?r;)    @La rousse  Je ne pense pas qu'il soit lgitime pour des lves de noter leurs profs, mais je pense qu'il est beaucoup plus grave et illgitime de l'interdire. De toutes manires si il perd en appel le site sera hberg au Luxembourg, en Suisse ou en Angleterre.    Ce qui est pour moi certain en revanche c'est que dans l'EN il y a une vraie Omerta sur plusieurs sujets dont celui l : Il n'y a que des bons profs. Et pour moi tout les moyens sont bons pour faire sauter ces pratiques.   Et je ne fais pas partie de ces couillons de parents d'lves qui se rvoltent parfois contre les profs trop svres / exigeants / ou notant mal.

Je ne vois pas pourquoi il faudrait que les profs soient nots par leurs lves; ils le sont dj par leurs suprieurs hirarchiques et par leurs inspecteurs.  Et je ne vois pas non plus pourquoi il faudrait que cette note soit rendue publique. Aprs tout, les bulletins des lves ne le sont pas. Ils peuvent avoir des notes et des apprciations excrables sans que cela soit port  la connaissance de tous.  Le mtier de prof est extrmement difficile, surtout de nos jours.

De plus, ce systme a t mis en place dans beaucoup de pays, et les rsultats ne sont pas ceux que l'on pourrait attendre... Bref, ce que je veux dire, c'est que les lves qui tapent sur les profs et les insultent, ils ne reprsentent pas la France!!! Une bien belle image!!!  Certes, la maturit des lves peut parfois amener des ractions de ce genre, "oh tiens, on va aller le noter celui l, tu vas voir, on va lui foutre une taule"  Mais je ne pense pas que ce soit le cas pour tous le monde, pardon, je sais que ce n'est pas le cas pour tous le monde...  Moi, je trouve ce systme interessant du point de vue o, un professeur qui fait correctement son travail, un professeur qui donne l'envie  ses lves de travailler, un professeur qui sait tre cool tout en se faisant respecter, un professeur qui donne du sien pour rendre les cours intressant, ce professeur l  droit de recevoir cette mince rcompence qu'est cette note en retour de son travail... Car oui, je pense que tous ces critres font qu'un prof soit bon ou pas... Pour moi, le mtier d'enseignant ne se limite pas  vomir des cours devant une classe de gamin endormis ou de corriger des copies le week end... Nan, pour moi, l'intert de la profession, c'est de donner l'envie, de rendre les choses qui paraissent pnibles plus accessibles, et cela dans le sourire...  Et ce genre de professeur ci n'auront pas de problme en ce qui concerne les notes...  Je ne comprends pas vraiment pourquoi cela gne autant, je pense qu'un lve, s'il fait preuve d'un peu de srieux, est capable d'estimer le travail de son professeur... Oui, certes, ils n'ont jamais mis les pieds dans le monde du travail... Pourtant, tu vois, face  cette remarque que je trouve un tant soit peu dplace, et bien si ils ne l'ont jamais fait, eux, ils recoivent directement le travail de leurs professeurs!!! Ils sont plus  mme de dire si le cours est complet, clair et bien expliqu... Et bien evidemment, ce genre de comportement n'arrive pas face  un professeur digne de ce nom, celui qui sait rendre sa matire vivante, celui qui sait tre proche de ses lves tout en se faisant respecter... Oui, ce genre de professeur existe bien, mais il est s?r que tous ne le sont pas forcment...  Je pense qu'il s'agit simplement de la peur d'une dsacralisation du statut de professeur... Ce que que je respecte personnellement mais ne comprend pas pour autant...  Juste un petit point sur lequel je voudrais revenir encore, je serais curieuse de savoir ce que tu entends par "les jeunes d'aujourd'hui"  Oui, la notion de respect existe encore, il me semblait qu'il ne fallait pas faire d'un cas une gnralit, mais ceci ne semble pas aussi evident pour tous le monde...Maintenant, il est vrai qu'une socit ne peut tre parfaite puisque la perfection n'existe pas, certes, des imbciles, comme partout il y en a, mais est-ce vraiment une raison pour blamer la jeunesse d'aujourd'hui comme tu le dis?  Ah oui, encore une chose, il me semble bien qu'un gamin n'est capable d'agir en socit que de la fa?on dont on lui a appris  se conduire... Est-ce alors les gamins qu'il faut blamer, ou bien les personnes charg de lui donner cette ducation??? (j'entend ici aussi bien l'envirronnement familial que scolaire)  Tu sembles soucieux de la prsence ou non du respect dans les valeurs de la jeunesse, oui, mais le respect, il aura bien fallu quelqu'un pour l'inculquer  ces jeunes!!!  xD Et maintenant, ou est la faille????|`|ae0c17831fed69fea1889d0e26ae02b6aa	Je ne pense pas que les lves soient les mieux placs pour noter leurs professeurs. Les mauvais lves auront bien s?r tendance  les noter mal... A l'heure o l'on se plaint que les professeurs ne sont plus respects, cette innovation n'est pas des plus intelligentes.

The male chav is distinguishable by his birght colours and imitaion gold jewellry which he uses to attract chavettes (see next). Any eye contact will be met with a tirade of abuse assuming the chav is with his herd. 3 Chavette A female chav who is distinguishable by the use of earings resting on her shoulders, very innapropriate clothing, and a pram. Chavettes are very rarely seen on their own and prefer to hang around with the dominant chav in their herd, usually the father of their child. 4 Chavish the dialect of the chav. Believing that he is a bad boy gangsta rapper, the chav or chavette will converse with others in a secrect language. Scientists have been working for years on trying to decipher chavish but to no avail. Other than swear words that you will manage to pick out, you will not understand any of this tirade; simply assume its not pleasant and probably involves your parents and a dog.     Good luck to you.  |`|cTvP6j7Haa	Never heard the word, therefore I can't say.

Esto te lo digo porque mucha gente no sabe cmo sacar conclusiones o sntesis de lo que se expresa en la sagrada escritura. Tobas es bastante digerible y no te meteras en problemas de la misma manera en que lo haras si leyeras por ejemplo Reyes, que es muy intrincado. Yo personalmente no te aconsejo que te metas con el Nuevo Testamento, es mejor el Antiguo porque te forma sobre el fundamento del comportamiento moral de la sociedad en que vives. El fruto que yo he ido obteniendo poco a poco es mejorar mi estado como ser humano dentro del plano que ya te mencione, adems de que la ideologa expresada en el Antiguo Testamento es irrefutable si la sabes situar dentro de los objetivos que deseas asir.

eSAf8vjPaa	What a wonderful idea. When I used to teach, the parent association for the school would give us each a questionaire, asking us what we would prefer--a gift card to Target, manicure/pedicure, gift card to the movies, gift card to grocery store, etc. On Teacher's Day the parent association bought us all lunch and had it delivered and we got the item we chose as a gift.     Items that can be personalized are always great gifts as well.     I also got a GREAT gift one time from a parent, who filled a basket with different kinds of thank you notes and generic notecards. I used these all the time as a teacher to write to parents, so that was a very useful and thoughtful gift.     Teachers get plenty of teacher themed gifts and lotions/shower gels, so if you're looking for something more unique, you may want to avoid that.|`|wMzCuPoUaa	massages  Getting nails done  A luau theme ??

We either have a Potluck to go along with the theme or they order some kind of lunch for us.  With this Theme some one came out and set up in our Teachers lounge to let us try out different products from BeautiControl, it was fun!  We also do crossword puzzles or word searches and turn them in and who ever participates, they pick a few out of the stack and you win a gift card to random business in our area!

L'une est voise (le G) et l'autre sourde (le C).    Plus simplement, le G, c'est un C avec de la voix. On dit C avec sauf que en mme temps on fait vibrer les cordes vocales fortement (pour un C normal il n'y en a pas besoin).    Enfin, les voyelles (E et O) sont toutes des sons o l'on fait fortement vibrer les cordes vocales. Donc, dans le cas de "seconde", c'est plus facile de les faire continuer  vibrer en passant de E  O. Donc le C devient G.    Pour la question de l'othographe, ?a ne s'explique pas. En gnral, les mots qui ont vus leurs orthographes modifie, ?a tait avant que le "vrai" Fran?ais se gnralise  toute la France.

AA11298562	The English is pretty good, good sentence structure, a few mis-spellings.  Suggestions:  SPORTS COMPLEX CITY: 'events' should be singular  - 'Contain' should have an 's' at the end  - do you mean it contains fields and/or apparatus for all the worlds sports?  MEDICAL CITY: treats is a transient verb, you need to tell what it treats.  Patients, I would assume.  - 'research', no 'es' on the end  - use 'as well' or 'also', not 'too'  - 'in order to find', not 'for finding'  - diseases (spelling)  UNIVERSITY CITY: 'every major that you can think of', or 'every major that crosses your mind'  - replace 'you can find it' with 'can be found'  - either 'student body would be up to one million....' or 'university would hold up to one million...."  - '200,000 of the students would be', not 'going to be' (unless you're SURE this is going to happen)  -AIRPORT CITY: you have 'Airports', which is plural, followed by 'does', which is singular.  Pick one, or better, replace 'does' with 'provide'.  -If you're talking speculatively, the next sentence should be 'It would', instead of 'it's going to'.  - no comma after 'shows'  MALL CITY: 'buy' not 'own'  - period after 'brands'  - then a new sentence: That is the kind of mall....  FACTORY CITY: put 'is' between 'city' and 'that'  - where are they putting the lables?  - say, not says  - provide, not secure  - for, not from  - beyond, not behind  - provide for, not secure    If you have questions, email me

Now how to take the test.    take it 3 times on the same paper..    Go through it the first time quickly and do all the ones you are sure of, or are easy, skip the ones you don't know or aren't sure of. Don't spend ANY time on the hard ones or more complex the first time through.    Then go back through and take it a second time (go over your test again) to get the ones you now remember cause the ones you knew will help you to remember how to do the ones you didn't know. Or give you a general idea now.  Again skip the harder ones and go to the ones you know or are familiar with now.    Go back quickly the last time and make sure you didn't miss any questions, guess if you must on the hardest, there might be only one or two at this point. And quick proof.    Go over a test three times has ALWAYS worked for me.    
MyUi3Blyaa	At this age if your child is able to read silently and comprehend or get the general idea of what is being read then she is right on track. When a child at this age reads to you aloud they will often miss or substitute similar meaning words as they read, don't worry about this just let them enjoy reading. The hardest part of mathematics is usually the measurement strand yet this is the most practical for parents to teach. Get her to estimate area and volume before she measures them accurately and this will give her a great headstart for year 5 and 6.  Try this site. It's not too busy and the forum is serious.|`|AA11298562	The first thing to do is talk to her teacher.  Ask about what the kids are learning and how your daughter is doing.  Ask if there's anything in particular your daughter is struggling with and how you can help her to be a better student.  I assure you, her teacher will be happy to help you with this!  The biggest problem most kids face in school is trouble reading.  If a child can't read, they can't study anything else, so make sure your daughter can read and understand her textbooks.  If you don't feel like your daughter is learning enough in her current classroom, talk to the principal.  Ask to observe other classrooms to see if there's a difference.  You might want to take her to a child development specialist to get a professional opinion.  However, keep in mind that all children develop at different rates.  If you put too much pressure on your daughter to succeed, she may get frustrated or depressed and decide it's not worth it to try.  The biggest and most important thing you can do to help your daughter to be smart is to teach her a love of reading and a love of learning.  Read books with her, take her to the library, and let her see you reading and studying.  Make everyday occurences opportunities to learn something new.  Don't be ashamed to admit when you don't know something and suggest you look it up and learn about it together.  Be excited about learning and she will learn that from you.  If she learns to love learning, nothing will be able to stop her!

When my sister got accepted to a college, she got a whole folder right away but when my younger brother was accepted last spring to a different school, it only had a one page letter letting him know he was accepted and then other information came later.    I would advise calling...you'll get the same answer whether you call now or in a week, but at least then you'll know and can start making plans accordingly.|`|c5UAa65qaa	Call them.  I believe that the deposit is only legally binding if the acceptance itself is legit, so I don't see what you have to gain from waiting.

Se non ne hai la possibilit, una soluzione sarebbe parlare con qualcuno che lo spagnolo e/o l'inglese lo sappiano bene, un madrelingua ad esempio. Altrimenti anche guardare film e leggere libri in lingua originale aiuta parecchio.  Anche io ho frequentato il liceo linguistico. Il francese l'ho studiato alle medie e poi, alle superiori, son stata costretta ad abbandonarlo.  In compenso ho studiato il tedesco (3 anni in 1!) e ora oltre alle classiche: "Was ist dein Name?" e "Aufwiedersehen" non ricordo nulla (sigh sigh). Lo spagnolo l'ho studiato dalla 3 classe in poi e ricordo poco e niente. L'inglese invece ho avuto modo di approfondirlo anche dopo aver conseguito il diploma e lo parlo correttamente. Uno dei metodi che ho utilizzato per apprendere l'inglese di tutti i giorni  stato chattare con gente inglese, americana, australiana. Mi ha aiutato tanto. Ho letto un sacco di libri e guardo ogni film in lingua originale, magari con i sottotitoli le prime volte.  Tanto dipende anche dagli insegnanti che hai. Secondo me dovrebbero parlare SEMPRE nella lingua che insegnano, anche per dire: "Sabato compito in classe"...in questo modo ci si abitua presto al suono della lingua e si imparano anche le espressioni quotidiane.

807896964b6a149310aa786e3a57e292aa	Em biologia, chama-se fertiliza??o ao momento em que um espermatozide penetra num vulo (nos animais), ou em que o tubo polnico penetra no vulo (nas plantas) durante o processo de reprodu??o.    Confrontar com singamia e conjuga??o.    Em geral, a fecunda??o  intra-especfica, isto , processa-se apenas entre indivduos da mesma espcie. Mas h casos de fecunda??o inter-especfica, entre indivduos de duas espcies evolucionariamente prximas. Os indivduos que nascem destas fecunda??es designam-se por hbridos (exemplo: os cavalos e os burros podem cruzar-se, dando a origem a um hbrido: o macho ou mula).    O vulo, gameta feminino, possui barreiras para a penetra??o dos espermatozides: a corona radiata (mais externa, composta de clulas foliculares) e a zona pelcida (camada glicoprotica situada aps a corona radiata). Os espermatozides, gametas masculinos, possuem na cabe?a o acrossomo, que come?a a liberar enzimas hidrolticas ao entrar em contato com tais barreiras. Aps venc-las, ocorre a fus?o entre as membranas dos dois gametas. Imediatamente aps a fecunda??o, a membrana do vulo se altera para impedir a entrada de outros espermatozides. Os 23 cromossomos de cada gameta se unem, formando o zigoto, com 46 cromossomos.|`|e2bb10e6ce9fcc6df1df2046ffe82a9aaa	Entendendo a fecunda??o            Camila Tavares                        O milagre da vida  um processo complexo do corpo feminino.

Depois do vulo fecundado, a trompa o empurra para dentro do tero, onde ele se fixa e, s ent?o, pode-se dizer que a mulher est grvida.

S que apenas um espermatozide consegue penetrar o vulo, auxiliado pelo enzima hialuronidase que "quebra" as camadas que recobrem o vulo. Essa enzima est presente no acrossomo (complexo de golgi) do espermatozide.    Basicamente  isso!!!|`|ce7f91dc03835520e3755e9fe8d86182aa	Em zoologia, a gravidez se refere ao estado resultante da fecunda??o de um vulo pelo espermatozide, envolvendo tambm o subseqente desenvolvimento, no tero, do feto que foi gerado pela fecunda??o, encerrando-se na expuls?o, chamada de "parto" ou "nascimento".       Processo  Durante a gravidez (ou prenhez), o ventre da fmea encontra-se aumentado com o volume dos vulos ou do feto. Tambm se chama a este perodo gesta??o, que indica o desenvolvimento do(s) embri?o(?es).    O fim da gravidez, ou seja, a expuls?o do feto do tero, chama-se parto ou "dar  luz".    A dura??o da gravidez depende essencialmente das espcies e suas caractersticas, como o tamanho (animais de maior porte tm gesta??es mais longas) ou o tempo de desenvolvimento do indivduo jovem. No Homem essa dura??o  de cerca de 38 semanas (266 dias) aps a concep??o, ou seja cerca de 40 semanas aps a ltima menstrua??o. As vacas tm um perodo de gesta??o semelhante, cerca de 270 dias, no entanto os ratos, s tm um perodo de gesta??o de 21 dias. A gesta??o humana divide-se em trs trimestres, cada um correspondendo a aproximadamente 3 meses. S a partir do segundo trimestre  que a gravidez se come?a a notar e a m?e poder sentir os primeiros movimentos do seu feto.    Para que haja gravidez,  necessrio que exista intera??o entre o ovo fecundado e o organismo materno. N?o basta haver o fen?meno reprodutivo, a fecunda??o, o desenvolvimento de um embri?o e o nascimento de um novo ser para que haja gravidez. Todos estes fen?menos ocorrem em animais que, sabemos, n?o engravidam (peixes, aves, insetos etc.).    Entre a fecunda??o e a nida??o do ovo n?o h como o organismo materno identificar sua presen?a. Considerando-se sob o ponto de vista essencialmente materno, a gesta??o s come?a no momento da nida??o (implanta??o do ovo na cavidade uterina), quando ocorre o incio da intera??o entre o ovo e o organismo materno. Esta intera??o , a princpio, hormonal, com a secre??o pelo ovo da gonadotrofina cori?nica (HCG  horm?nio cori?nico gonadotrfico) produzida pelo sincciotrofoblasto. O HCG ter como principal fun??o neste momento a manuten??o do corpo lteo ovariano materno, impedindo a queda dos nveis hormonais ovarianos e a conseqente menstrua??o.

AA11017928	Not much time, but here are some considerations:    1.  minimum daily production required for the plant to be 'profitable.'    Paper plants are generally made to produce a specific type of paper.  For example, a kraft plant cannot produce newsprint.    Profitable has many meanings, but to an accountant it must be able to pay off its debt, pay current expenses, escrow for major repairs, and pay its investors a reasonable return on their investment.  There must be enough money in escrow to protect the investors' capital should there be a slow-down or strike, during which the plant would be at a reduced/zero capacity.    2.  The plant must meet all requirements for environmental permits.    3.  The plant must have access to sufficient land, power, water, rails, highways, as well have sufficient labor in the commuting area that has the 'knowledge, skills, and abilities' (KSA's) to run the plant.    4.  There must be a sufficient demand, both now and in the foreseeable future, for the product under consideration.    Now, if you are writing a paper, be sure to use correct grammar and punctuatoin, as well as words that are spelled correctly.

In such cases the two districts are counted as a  single school district government for census purposes.California school districts and community college districts  are usually governed by elected boards of education or  trustees. The districts serving charter cities may have  appointed boards if the charter so specifies.School district and community college district boards may  determine their own fiscal requirements; the counties levy  and collect the taxes required. The tax levies, however, are  subject to constitutional tax limitations except for taxes  levied to pay bonds issued before June 1978.

These schools are  administered by the county superintendent. The schools  are not counted as separate governments. In a number of  counties these services are provided through itinerant  teachers or special classes in the regular schools rather  than through separate special schools. As of June 1997,  60 California counties were operating such services.Regional occupational programs are described under  Other Educational Activities, below. These programs may  be established either by a single county or city-county, or  by two or more counties or school districts.

Os pastis s?o geralmente pequenos, ao contrrio das tartes, empad?es ou pastel?es e podem ser doces, como o pastel de nata, ou salgados, como ps pastis de carne e queijo. H varia??es no recheio do pastel, como o pastel de bacalhau (tradicional lanche vendido no Mercado Municipal de S?o Paulo) e o chamado especial, com carne moda e ovos.   um alimento muito comum em feiras populares, sendo que muitas pessoas consomem substituindo uma refei??o. Normalmente acompanhado com um copo de caldo de cana ou gua de coco.  Como a maior parte da melhor do?aria portuguesa, os Pastis de Belm tm origem conventual, verificando-se neste caso uma grande proximidade geogrfica da fbrica centenria com o local onde nasceu a receita: o Mosteiro dos Jernimos. Reza a histria que um frade deste Convento precisava de dinheiro e vendeu a receita dos pastis a um comerciante, proprietrio de uma mercearia na povoa??o de Belm. Outras fontes d?o-nos dados mais precisos acerca de um confeiteiro, proprietrio de uma refinaria de a?car situada entre os Jernimos e o Palcio, chamado Domingos Rafael Alves, que se tornou amigo de um pasteleiro que trabalhava no Mosteiro. Acontece que, com a revolu??o de 1820, muitas foram as ordens religiosas que acabaram, deixando os frades e freiras sem casa e os trabalhadores sem emprego. O referido confeiteiro contratou ent?o o pasteleiro detentor do segredo dos Pastis de Belm para os confeccionar na prpria refinaria com o objectivo de os vender ao pblico. A fama de tais doces logo se espalhou entre os lisboetas, tendo a casa sido transformada, com o passar dos tempos, na nica e verdadeira fbrica dos Pastis de Belm. O pasteleiro trabalhava de madrugada, em segredo, fechado numa oficina,  semelhan?a do frade que no convento ter inventado a receita. Entretanto, o dono da confeitaria tratou de registar a patente da receita, salvaguardando o segredo at aos nossos dias.

09fe5e6eaafdda0064b542206ced8709aa	The original expression was hand over hand, which was chiefly nautical and referred literally to rope work: climbing a rope, or pulling something in with a rope, would be "climbing it hand over hand," that is, with each hand brought over the other.     This was then extended figuratively to mean 'with continuous progress; with regular advances', especially as used of a ship chasing and gaining on another ship. From here it's a very small step to 'speedily; increasingly', the sense in "making money hand over fist," which is about the only way the phrase is found nowadays.     The form hand over fist, instead of the original hand over hand, is an obvious and natural variant (close your hand around a rope and you do, indeed, make a fist).     The literal use of hand over hand is recorded in English by the middle of the eighteenth century. The figurative use, and the hand over fist form (in all senses), appear by the early nineteenth century.|`|dSp19PaIaa	I quote:  "Although "hand over fist" is almost always heard today in the context of making money rapidly and in great quantity, its origins lie in a field that was (and is) very unlikely to land its practitioners on the cover of Fortune. The original form, back in the 18th century, was "hand over hand," and it referred to climbing or pulling a rope or line aboard ship in the natural fashion, by grasping it with one hand while the other hand was moved forward to get a new grip.    By the early 19th century, "hand over hand" was being used figuratively to mean "with steady progress," as one ship might be said overtake another "hand over hand" in a race. At about the same time the variant "hand over fist" appeared with the same meaning, apparently because the hand holding the rope is closed in a fist while the free hand is open while it moves forward. I hope that's clear -- it isn't easy explaining this stuff while you're having flashbacks to 6th grade gym class.    By the late 19th century, "hand over fist" was being used as a metaphor for steady progress in any endeavor, especially in making money. But as any student of high finance knows, simply making steady money is for chumps. The goal is to make pots of the stuff very quickly, and so by the early 20th century "making money hand over fist" had shifted its meaning to "making a great deal of money very quickly." "    I've searched through many sites and they all point to the same nautical origins.

5dbadfddbf6e6ab4dec87817d90e87c8aa	I was just like your daughter. I hated science in high school. I took chemistry. I thought it was fun and interesting. Physics is math, science and theory. At my high school, they wouldn't let you take it unless you took trig. I suggest you have her take chem, because it is a lot easier.|`|irddFPQnaa	Chemistry is definitely easier.  Physics is math and theory.  Chemistry has a lot to do with everyday things as well..  detergants, drinks (also alcoholic), food.. stuff like that..  And, Chemistry is always good to know cause you are guaranteed to get into a university (in europe) if your daughter one day decides to wanna study medicine.  Physics is good to know if your daughter is into astronomy, math, aero-stuff. etc...  So, I personally would chose chemistry, considering I'm not a great scientist just like your daughter.  However, if you do see that she is good in maths, maybe physics is a good option.  I'd chose chemistry because its mainly all about memorising and just thinking logically.

Est compuesta principalmente de dos gases, nitrgeno (casi el 78 %) y oxgeno (casi el 21%), adems de agua, partculas de polvo y sal, dixido de carbono y otros gases, perfectamente mezclados unos con otros. La capa inferior y ms fina de la atmsfera es la troposfera y en ella ocurren la mayor parte de los fenmenos meteorolgicos porque acumula el 80% de los gases atmosfricos y vapor de agua. La capa de ozono de la atmsfera protege y permite la vida en el planeta al filtrar y absorber las peligrosas radiaciones ultravioletas del Sol.     La atmsfera terrestre tiene varias funciones bsicas: protege al planeta de los rayos solares que son da?inos; permite la vida terrestre al ofrecer oxgeno para el reino animal y dixido de carbono para el vegetal; proporciona agua potable, y ajusta la presin vital sobre nuestro organismo. Desde el punto de vista del clima tiene una funcin fundamental, pues regula la temperatura terrestre: equilibra la del da con la de la noche (momento en que no llegan los rayos solares que dan luz y calor), y transporta el calor de las zonas ms clidas a las ms fras del planeta. El transporte de aire en la atmsfera recibe el nombre de circulacin atmosfrica.  La atmsfera terrestre es la capa gaseosa que rodea a la Tierra. Est compuesta por nitrgeno (78,1%) y oxgeno (20,94%), con peque?as cantidades de argn (0,93%), dixido de carbono (variable, pero alrededor de 0,035%), vapor de agua, nen (0,00182%), helio (0,000524%), criptn (0,000114%), hidrgeno (0,00005%) y ozono (0,00116%).    Protege la vida de la Tierra absorbiendo en la capa de ozono parte de la radiacin solar ultravioleta, reduciendo las diferencias de temperatura entre el da y la noche, y actuando como escudo protector contra los meteoritos.

How about doing your own work and writing your paper yourself?  Are you really too lazy to write one, but willing to do extra work to search for a good plagarized one?  Seems backwards to me! That....and FYI, it's VERY obvious to teachers when the level of writing of an essay is higher than you're capable of, which is most likely exactly what will happen if you choose to cheat!|`|2562ffc0eec99a7c3d0d53083e3a0a5daa	Nope

Fai attenzione e non dare retta!  1) devi controllare su internet sul sito del ministero, appena sono state divulgate le liste.  2) il punteggio calcolato potrebbe essere sbagliato, a quel punto dovrai fare ricorso.  3) verr pubblicata una graduatoria definitiva (e dovrai controllare)  4) a questo punto CONSIGLIO il giro in tutte le 20 scuole (se possibile per controllare.

737afd6d3492f6a243591de1bdf95c77aa	This is always difficult but don't dispair.    The best thing to do it look at the job offer and list the qualifications, skills and anything else the employer is asking for.    Once you have this it is time to write the cover letter. Try and match yourself as close as possible to each requirement. If the say they need computer skills but you have done no computer courses write that you have worked on various computer packages MS/WORD etc.. in prepairing for you projects at college.    Don't be afraid to say that you do not have specific experiance but always make up for it by saying you have the ability to learn quickly and you are confident that you will be sucessful in all aspects of the position.    In my experiance companies would rather pay less and get someone with potential they can train with the outcome of having an employee with the skills and paying them less than an experianced person from the start paying them more.    Remember the Resume only gets you to the interview stage. It is there that you need to be confident and truly beleive you are the right person for the job.    I always say that if you approch everything with an extremely positive mind and try and suppress the thought of I am not good enough, you will succeed.    Chin up and if you get a knock back and you are not offered the job than dont worry because the people interviewing you know what they are looking for. Always be yourself as the interviewee does not want to be in the position of employing someone they thought was something else. If you are not the right person for the job accept that it does not mean you are not good enough rather that you would not fit in that specific work environment.|`|773423912135c7df27e7d885f006f8fcaa	write and show your interests, knowledge in handling graphic design software, & if possible backed up with some personal projects.|`|AA10075766	I would keep it simple, while showing that you have a passion for graphic design and that you want to continue learning with a reputable company (such as yours).

AA10439008	It's sort of like being a teacher - no matter how hard you try, you will never fully reach 100% of your students.  You just hope to reach as many as possible.  There are many questioners who just snap up your answers and never look at what you wrote as explanation.  But others write back with thinks like "Thanks for explaining that, I get it now!" or "I was able to get a 92 on my test with your help" or "I wish you were my teacher instead of xxxx".|`|UEdNd3a3aa	I have not had that problem, but I'm sure some people asking questions are just looking for the answers, so that they do not have to do the work. Many students today it's about the marks  not about how to do it and their understanding. I don't think this the norm but there is always one who makes it look bad for the rest.     Some may have forgot their homework the night before and is last minute trying to get it done to avoid detention. I normally try to explain the question if they present multiple questions, I try to give an example with explanations, so one of there's with the steps (I normally answer the math questions) and I've never had negative comments    I try to answer the questions on here the same way I tutor and teach math.|`|a772ac727655daef254b8e6748f36d1faa	This generation of youth wants to be spoon fed.

44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	When I applied for a post grad certificate in education I did two things that they asked. I spent a couple of days observing in a local primary school. The main thing was I spent two terms as a part time pottery teacher in my old secondary school. It was so terrifying to be thrown into a class room with no guidance or support whatsoever, all I could do was pretend to be how I thought a teacher ought to be. Then I realised I had been in school long enough to know how it can be done well or badly. So, not so hard after all. But I sweated like a pig! I just called up my old school and explained what I needed and they were more than happy to have me. Good Luck (you never stop pretending, teaching is all acting)|`|AA11656683	Be a classroom assistant for a day at your local school. Teach English to foreigners in Evening School. Get a TEFL.

And so on...|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Well you would go to uni and study history, then go to a teacher training college to do a one year teaching course, the PGCE.|`|TWKIuTEyaa	I think you may have misinterpreted what you have been reading.    It is usual for PGCE students to get experience immediately prior to the commencement of their course, usually in a local school (they make contact with the relevant Headteachers and arrange it themselves).    It is not necessary for you to have any other formal experience of teaching prior to PGCE, although any voluntary/paid work you might do with children/young people will obviously enhance your application (as would any additonal qualifications you might acquire, such as TEFL).    For now, you should concentrate on getting good A-level grades and a First or 2:1 History degree. You should not focus on PGCE requirements until your final year at university (if then): requirements may well have changed by then anyway.    The official sites for PGCE are here:    http://www.tda.gov.uk/Recruit/thetrainin...    and here:    http://www.gttr.ac.uk/    but, as I said, this should not be your main focus at this point.

Sozc3MyFaa	After your bachelors degree (in a pre-med curricula) you would need to get into med school which is 4 years, and then do a residency which for sports medicine would be about 5 years (in say, orthopedics) and then a fellowship1-2 years.  Med school does not give you a choice in what you need to take (except for elective clerkships)--the program is a sequential set program.  For your undergrad degree, the college/uni will tell you as well what you need to fulfill their grad requirements as well as fulfill the pre-med requirements.

AA11604732	If you have good grades in your MA program, then you will be able to get into SOME PhD program.  If not, it may be difficult to get into any.    The quality of the PhD program will depend on the quality of the MA school.  If you got your MA at some fourth tier university, don't expect to get into Stanford or Harvard.  But if you got it at a decent school (for example a top tier public university like Michigan or one of the UC schools), then you should be able to get into a good PhD program.      If your MA grades are much better than your undergraduate grades, make sure you address that in your cover letter, stating that they are more indicative of how you will do in a PhD program.    I did not do that well as a Freshman -- though I did better later -- but it hurt my undergraduate GPA.  I got into several top graduate programs because I explained how my later grades showed what I can do.  After getting a Master's at Duke, I was able to get into a PhD program at Berkeley -- so I know it can be done.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	Yes|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	It depends on how well you did in your Masters level work and which University you are looking into.
TufsEE2baa	You will get alot of people not taking you seriously. Everyone will treat you like you are there to get a husband. I almost went into automotive school.  In my driving profession I met many mechanics. I talked to them about going to auto school. Most of those guys end up changing oil and tires until they can get apprenticed buy a shop. If I was you I would go into the welding or body work so you dont end up at a oil changing place. You should have a place to go after school before you do all that and take out loans and such. A good friend of mine showed me how to maintenance my car like change the rotors, breaks,  and calipers. I have installed starter and changed my oil. I had a lot of fun. I work with men and they are a pain to women. Guys who are successfull with that occupation do it all the time and on their free time. You will get rough hands. Those shops are often cold and not heated. 10 - 12 hours a day cold and dirty. Those guys deserve props they never get paid enough.
50WCN0graa	Straterra is generally one of the "milder" ADHD medications. It does not tend to have as many side effects as some of the other drugs. You haven't up'd your dosage by a huge amount, so you will probably be okay. Just an FYI: sometimes when you change dosage you may have a slight recurrence of side effects, but hopefully that stops within a couple weeks. That said, you may have no side effects what so ever.    Potential Common Side Effects are: mood swings, irritability, decreased appetite, and nausea. It is not uncommon for these to pop up for a few weeks right after uping your dose. They should subside though... if they don't, tell your doctor.    The following side effects or more serious. If you get any of these, contact your doctor immediately: depression, anxiety attacks, hostility, insomnia, and suicidal thoughts. If you get any of these, your doctor will probably want to take you off the higher dose immediately. Since you have already been on the drug and reacted fine, though, you probably will not get any of these.    If you can recall the side effects that you had when you first started taking straterra... if you get any side effects, you will most likely get those same ones again for a short period of time.|`|3bahzW9Uaa	The biggest side effect that I would be on the look out would be depression, suicidal thoughts.  I worked with a couple of teenagers who were on strattera.  One was on 60mg, a 14 yr old male who weighed about 120 tops.  He did well on strattera and it really helped him.  The other boy, also 14, weighed closer to 200 lbs and was on the same dose.  He ended up with major depression, suidical thoughts, would carve into his leg or arm "kill me".  Once the strattera was removed, he had a major turn around.         Keep an emotional diary to track your moods, that way you can see subtle changes as they crop up and when the changes occur (if they occur).  This would also help your doctor if he needs to adjust meds.

x1VLBHOJaa	While the United States of America has been called a superpower country for many years, a development of science also became a superpower. One of the things that allow America to maintain its status as a super-powerful country is the development of math and science. These subjects are not developed over a short period of time. When these subjects are studied over many years, then we can see a development of science and math. Therefore, a success of math and science depends on how important the foundation is. The government know this well, therefore it spends money on education. Math and science is emphasized as an important issue in our life. The government spends money and time investing in school programs for enhancing math and science skills. This leads students to feel the importance of math and science, and therefore hire better math and science teachers so that teachers can teach students better. Education is an important place to prepare the future.     The last bit is nonsense so I can't correct it.|`|qPrMM2r6aa	This is good, and I don't know what level writing you are expected to have, but this is how I would re-write that:    While United States is a superpower country, there have been many important developments in science, which has also become a superpower. Developments in math and science have helped America to remain a superpower. These subjects are not developed in short times. These subjects are studied for many years before we see a development of math and science. America's standing as a superpower relies on math and science, so these topics have a solid foundation for research. Math and science are important issues in our life. The United States' Department of Education spends money and time investing into to school programs for enhancing students' math and science skills. This leads to students who understand the importance of math and science. In turn, the country receives better math and science teachers - and the beat goes on.    Education is an important place to prepare a future. Education should be beneficial to students. (You should then elaborate more on this topic.)

Ivy leagues have far better network connections than Rutgers or other colleges. It's not to say that Rutgers or others don't have extensive networks, they do, but they don't open doors as easily. In Manhattan, having a very good business network can make or break your career or business.     If you intend to go to graduate school, then that's where things change. No graduate school will look at your application regardless of what college you came from with that low GPA.

VAZBvsoRaa	Las grficas se pueden clasificar en: Circulares, Grficas de barras o columnas y las grficas lineales.  Se emplea otras grficas llamadas HISTOGRAMAS, que tambien son graficas de barras. Estas se usan para  ilustrar muestras agrupadas en intervalos.

afikdpZoaa	Damned good question.    This deserves a very long answer, but I'll give you a short one.    The orchestra with which we are familiar in the West is actually very modern, though we think of Beethoven and Wagner as "old dead white guys".    Bach was a "modernist" in the sense of arguing for the use of a musical scale of "equal temperment" rather than the traditional scale based on naturally occurring harmonic overtones (look up "harmonics" and "equal tempering").  Equal tempering allows instruments to play in different keys in tune.    Instruments we now take for granted, like the clarinet and the valve trumpet, were scientific innovations of the highest order in the 1700s.  That seems like a long time ago only because humans die so young.  When you consider that the flute and trumpet go back to the beginnings of human civilization, and the ability to play a full chromatic scale in tune is just about 300 years old, you can see how modern this is.  To put it in context, Newton had given the world thermodynamics and calculus long before the piano was invented.    You can also go into the blending in the orchestra of winds, strings and percussion.  Lots of good science topics there, also.

rfwbZ2AXaa	While some students may be mature enough at 14 to drive, the majority are not.  Even at 16 the cognitive abilities are not really ready for most students to handle driving.  I stopped at an accident scene less than a year ago.  It was a 15 year old driver who had a head on with an older couple.  She was on the cell phone, changing the radio on station, and flying in excess of 20 mph over the speed limit.  She killed the driver of the other car.  She has a broken leg.  Most people who have not had a chance for their brains to fully mature cannot handle the responsibility of driving.  They seem to think that nothing bad will happen to them and that they can do all sorts of things while driving.   Not sure if this helps, but you should check into the way the brain develops.

a6kZ2q8Kaa	Since z = 3 + 3i and also z = 3 - 3i  Multiply the two factors arising and get   [z - (3 + 3i)]*[z - (3 - 3i)] = z^2 - z{3 + 3i} - z{3 - 3i} + {(3 + 3i)(3 - 3i)}  = z^2 - 3z - 3iz -3z + 3iz + 9 + 9i - 9i + 9  = z^2 - 6z + 18  I have checked the equation z^2 - 6z + 18 = 0 for roots and find them to be 3+3i , 3-3i  My next step would be to divide z^2 - 6z + 18 into z^3 - 18z + 108 and the result should be the third factor - for this division which is too tedious to type I get (z + 6) and hence the third root is z = - 6|`|tTg1XU8faa	If 3 + 3i is a root, then 3 - 3i is also a root. Use the method of completeing the square backwards to find the factor.    z = 3 +/- 3i (subtract 3 from both sides)   z - 3 = +/- 3i (square both sides)  (z - 3)^2 = -9 (FOIL)  z^2 - 6z + 9 = -9 (add 9 to both sides)  z^2 - 6z + 18 = 0    So z^2 - 6z + 18 has to be a factor of z^3 - 18z + 108 = 0. When you divide z^3 - 18z + 108 by z^2 - 6z + 18 with long division, you get z + 6, so that's the other factor. And so that means -6 is the other root.|`|3OP1YIXCaa	well     ( 3+ 3i )( 3+ 3i ) - 18( 3+ 3i ) +108= 0    9+ 18i+ 3i3  - 54- 54i+ 108 = 0    3i3 -36i+ 63=0    from there you would factory it. Now my question is, in this equation, is "i" a regular varriable just like "x" normally is, or does it stand for the square root of negative 1? this is important because that is what defines what the answer is.

IF you can factor it or have it in facotred form it is best to graph it, and then see the points where it is greater than or less than 0. Sorry if i sound like an  ***.|`|5NgSeHNXaa	Actually that answer is incorrect it should be x|x=3.     Just solve each one like an equality first. So instead of x^2+x>=12, just solve x^2+x=12 and solve it: x^2+x-12=0; (x+4)(x-3), so x=-4 or x=3.    Now use a number line, you know where to start, so draw a number line with points on -4 and 3, and remember that answer includes -4 and 3. Now test a couple other answers in the original equation. So if you test 0 you'll see that it 0^2+0 is not >= 12, so 0 isn't part of the solution, so the area in between -4 & 3 on the number line isn't part of the solution. So you can test -5 and find that it is a solution, meaning that everything less then -4 is part of the solution. Then test 5 and find that it is also a solution meaning that everything greater than 3 is part of the solution.  So you your answer is x|x=3.     It seem complicated, but all you need to do is find the base points by solving an equality then find out where the rest of the answers are in relation to those points

oaJcgz3uaa	My senior year I took AP Art, AP English, AP Spanish, AP European History, AP US History, pre-calculus, and attempted to take AP Biology.  I dropped AP biology because that was one class too many (and it was the hardest class in the school, no doubt).    Is physics necessary in high school (for your aforementioned degree)?  The simple answer is no.  Even if you took physics in highschool, you would most likely be required to take it again when you go to college.  Unless, of course, you take AP Physics, and scored a 4 or 5 on the AP exam (some universities vary on their required AP scores).  Same goes for AP Calc. If you score high enough on the AP exam, then that would most likely qualify as your college calculus credit.      Science degrees at almost all universities require a year of biology, first semester calculus, and a year of either chemistry or physics.  Pre-med would require a year of chemistry, a year of biology, a year of physics, a year of o-chem, a year of anatomy and physiology (at least) and I think a year of calculus.  You should look into your universities of choice and see if they will take AP scores of 4 or 5 as a replacement for the class, otherwise, I'd say taking AP calc and physics isn't entirely necessary.

My suggestion is to go to the school website, and look under the current students category for something that describes the distribution requirements everyone must fulfill to graduate.

Typical positions are with government jobs but they are not easy to come by anymore.  You will have zero specialized skills gained so you cannot apply for anything that calls for unique skills unless you have independently achieved them through some other way.  You will find this VERY tough finding a professional job that doesn't involve you doing sales, customer service work, manual labor, or general clerical help, all of which pays very low (except some commissioned sales positions which can bring high $$ if you're really good).      If you planned well in your college years, double majoring or minoring in something else marketable would help enormously.  In this case, math pairs nicely with philosophy and will allow you to have quant skills which are marketable to banks, financial institutions, insurance, and other related places that require such educated people.|`|V2nLbZZ5aa	Teaching.  That's pretty much it.  Until you have established some precedent for people listening to your ideas, and can write papers or books on the subject with new material, I don't know of any jobs with a requirement for skills in philosophy.    That said, many companies don't really care what your degree was, as long as it is an accredited school and you earned your degree.  The sheepskin is a "rite of passage" for many companies that opens the door to supervisory and management positions.  Just don't expect a prospective employer to figure out a way to use your background in philosophy to the extent that you might want.  Even folks with degrees in Engineering and Business end up working in a completely different field.
mkorCMx1aa	The korean war-   On June 25, 1950 the forces of North Korea crossed the 38th Parallel into the Republic of Korea, attacking at many points and landing sea-borne detachments on the east coast of South Korea. The magnitude of the assault made it clear that this was a full-scale invasion.    World reaction was swift.  At the request of the United States, the Security Council of the United Nations met on the afternoon of June 25 and called for immediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of North Korean forces to the 38th Parallel. As it soon became evident that the North Koreans had no intention of complying with this demand, President Truman ordered the United States Navy and Air Force to support the South Koreans by every possible means.    On the same day, a second UN resolution called on the Members to "furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area". This was, in effect, a declaration of war on North Korea.    On June 30 President Truman authorized the commitment of American troops. Other UN member nations offered forces and the Security Council recommended that all troops be placed under a single commander. Thus, a United Nations Command was established in Tokyo under General Douglas MacArthur of the United States.    Meanwhile, the North Koreans were pushing rapidly forward through the valleys and rice paddies of the Korean peninsula. The South Korean capital, Seoul, was occupied on June 28, and by the first week of August the UN forces were confined within the "Pusan Perimeter", a small area in the southeast of the peninsula. They were still being hard pressed when, on September 15, a successful allied amphibious landing was made at Inchon, the port of Seoul. This assault, coupled with a breakout from the Pusan bridgehead, changed the military situation overnight. The North Korean troops were soon in precipitate retreat.    The UN forces moved rapidly northward, recaptured Seoul, crossed the 38th Parallel and advanced towards the border of Manchuria. Then Communist China intervened. At the end of November strong Chinese forces crossed the frontier and launched a massive offensive which drove the UN and South Korean armies back across the 38th Parallel to positions well to the south along the Imjin River.    The Canadian Government, while agreeing in principle with the moves made to halt aggression, did not immediately commit its forces to action in Korea. At the close of the Second World War the Canadian armed forces had been reduced to peacetime strength and were specially trained for the defence of Canada. Furthermore, the Far East had never been an area in which Canada had any special national interest.    The first Canadian aid to the hard-pressed UN forces came from the Royal Canadian Navy. On July 12, 1950 three Canadian destroyers, HMCS Cayuga, HMCS Athabaskan and HMCS Sioux, were dispatched to Korean waters to serve under United Nations Command. These ships supported the assault at Inchon and played an especially important role in the evacuation, which followed the Chinese intervention. In the retreat south, a large body of American troops was cut off in the Chinnampo area. The three Canadian destroyers, together with an Australian and an American destroyer, negotiated the difficult Taedong river to successfully cover the embarkation.    Also in July, a Royal Canadian Air Force squadron was assigned to air transport du-ties with the United Nations. No. 426 Squadron flew regularly scheduled flights between McChord Air Force Base, Washington, and Haneda Airfield, Tokyo throughout the campaign.    On August 7, 1950, as the Korean crisis deepened, the Government authorized the recruitment of the Canadian Army Special Force. It was to be specially trained and equipped to carry out Canada's obligations under the United Nations charter or the North Atlantic Pact. The original components of the Special Force included the second battalions of the Royal Canadian Regiment (RCR), Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI), and Royal 22e Rgiment (R22eR); "C" Squadron of Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians); 2nd Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (RCHA); 57th Canadian Independent Field Squadron, Royal Canadian Engineers (RCE); 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade Signal Squadron; No. 54 Canadian Transport Company, Royal Canadian Army Service Corps (RCASC); and No. 25 Field Ambulance, Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps (RCAMC).    On August 8, Brigadier J.M. Rockingham accepted command of the Canadian Infantry Brigade. However, following the Inchon landings and the UN successes of September and October the war in Korea seemed to be near its end. Instead of a full brigade only the 2nd Battalion of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel J.R. Stone, proceeded to Korea.    By the time the troopship steamed into Yokohama on December 14,

5zhAdR1raa	The way I approach these types of problems is to look at the numbers, and see what factors they contain - so for instance, 16 is 2*8 or 4*4 or 16*1. That is important in figuring our what combination of the different possible factors can give you the middle term value you need. Be aware of the sign, remembering that two negative numbers, multiplied, make a positive number.     Also, if you divide every term by the same number it will make it easier.    So, for the first equation:    divide by 4:    9c^2 - 20cd + 4d^2    notice that 18+2 = 20..... so,    (9c - 2) (c - 2)    second equation:    divide by 3:    2x^2 - 11x + 15    15 = 3*5, so:    (2x - 5) (x - 3)    third equation - can't divide out anything this time:    Use trial and error to find the correct combination of factors. 12 is 2*6 or 4*3, 15 is 5*3.    20 - 9 = 11, Aha! So, we will be using 4*3 and 5*3. Just need to be careful to get them in the right order and with the correct sign!    (4c - 3) (3c + 5)    4th equation, similar to the third one - just need to use different factors to get the higher middle number. What combinations will give you negative 41? don't forget to consider the fact that 12 is also 12*1 and 15 is 15*1.    12*3 = 36, so that gets us part way to 41 - looks like a possibility, but will not give us the sign we need. But wait, 15*3 is 45:    (3d + 1) (4d - 15)    The last equation is not so simple. You will need to ask your teacher for help with that one - sorry!

This bird is said to be found in 'Mt. Tabor', where it perches on the shimmering 'Piedras Platas' tree at night. During the daytime, the bird goes off somewhere but it comes back at night to roost, and it sings before it sleeps.    The Adarna bird has a very long fancy tail, with numerous shiny metallic colors. It knows a total of seven songs that are believed to lull anyone to sleep as well as cure any type of afflictions; it changes its feathers into more colorful hues and shades after each song. After the last song, it excretes waste, then finally, sleeps with its eyes wide open. Its droppings (poop) can turn any living organism into stone|`|SSeUemEIaa	what language is that?

The reason you use 60, is because that's how many degrees out 360 the shaded area is (360=the entire circle).  Pi x r^2 is the formula for area of a circle.      so after everything is said and done it should be 49/6 pi or  8 and 1/6 pi.

Just remember this about college:  when you take those student loans out, it doesn't matter if you fail, you still owe that money.  College professors could care less if you attend class, they get paid either way.  I know that when I have kids, unless they get a scholarship, they're doing that first year at a CC.    Good luck.

When the Viet Min destroyed the French, the US unwisely decided to fight in Vietnam.  The cover was that we were fighting Communism.  Mostly we were feeding the arms industry as all wars tend to do.    We fought through more than 20 years - lost 50K kids - killed a million + Vietnamese people - all for absolutely nothing - and then lost the war anyway.

AA10988215	Typically yes, most postgraduate courses require that you have an undergraduate degree to gain a place.  Postgrad courses usually request that you have an undergraduate honours degree in a relevant subject and they also usually request that you got a good classification for your undergrad degree, such as a 2.1 or above.  Competitive courses may also request you posses relevant work experience alongside an honours degree.    Some postgrad courses, albeit not many, may allow entry if you have other qualifications coupled with a very high level of work experience relevant to the subject of the course.  This is usually decided at the discretion of the course team who organise the postgrad qualification.  You would need to demonstrate your academic and vocational abilities to a very high standard to get accepted without an honours degree though.    The best advice I can give you is to look up courses and check the entry requirements on individual prospectus' from universities you are interested in.    Hope this helps.|`|AA10289268	This is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on the school.  Do you want credit?  How close are you to graduating?  Professor have a rule for the classes?  Check the dept. policy.

Pick something that interests you, that your good at, that pays the bills, and that you enjoy... or atleast one or two of those things. I switched majors like 3 times in college, and now im doing a masters in business, when my BA was in psych.. so honestly don't think if you pick one field, your necessarily stuck in it because its declared in your transcripts.... your interests may change as you get older and grow, but in the end follow your heart your head... and do what makes you happy :D|`|a8rZEKxRaa	Study the subject of your interest.

There are thousands who are jobless, because they lacked the talent, skills and ability to pursue it and now find it hard to find and keep a good job, because they have no clue what to do.    Tell your parents that success is not confined to one or two fields like engineering / mba, it is spread all over......because there are successful people in all fields......    If success was related to one field, say MBA, then why doesn't every MBA student become a Dhirbubhai Ambani?    No. It can never be. Because you need to have passion and love for the field......if you love the field and have skills and talents to match, you will put more efforts, which will bring more success and money will follow.    If you choose something out of pressure, you will hate it, and you will put less efforts and this will affect your results, which will finally affect your career prospects....all this will also make you lose precious years and taking a different line will also become difficult.    hence, TALK and convince your parents - and assure them that you will do better in your choice of field than something which you don't like.    all the best !!!!|`|hG7qBks7aa	If you do something just because there is more opportunity and it pays well then you will be miserable vs. if you choose something you love to do.

Especially if your degree will enhance your value to your employer, it is in their best interests to help out if they can.     Can you reduce your hours?     Other than that, maybe you're putting too much pressure on yourself regarding your study. I knew guys that nearly had breakdowns doing the MBA because they were so focussed on getting 'A's all the time. Keep your life in perspective if you can and focus on what's most important (passing the course and having a life, or getting an A and putting work and relationships at risk?).
lZa9R7IFaa	MBA is about management in a business environment - it covers all fields, even engineering, because there is business in every field..    For eg., computer engineering - students in this field take MBA to learn the management skills and techniques required in companies, and since they have a computer background, they later look for jobs in computer related firms, for a management post.    Thus you work in your desired field having knowledge of how to manage it better.    MBA has the following major fields - finance, marketing and hr......you can choose the one that suits your talents and skills the better.    You may check the below given link for more info on these fields - the scope, future prospects, skills required etc.,    http://genwis.com/mba/mba.htm    all the best !!!
AA10988215	I think you possibly can, but you must be 'ordinarily resident' in Scotland-e.g. you cannot just live in Scotland for your University terms but still be permanently resident in England.  There may be a minimum number of years that you have to have lived in Scotland before you will be eligible to have your fees paid by the SAAS (Student Awards Agency for Scotland).  This is because there will undoubtedly be people who were born in England but been brought up/educated in Scotland who therefore have the same right to have their fees paid as someone born in Scotland.    However, the SAAS will not pay the fees of those who wish to simply come to Scotland to scrounge a free degree-you need to live here permanently!

I haven't started yet as I'm not too good and tend to leave it all 'til last minute, however I have started to reteach myself french because I have totally forgotten it all due to rubbish teachers.     I would probably suggest you start with the things you don't understand, and work your way through until everything you'r doing is purely revision in that you understand it all, it's just practise.     Make sure to read through all your classwork and any revision guides you have. And to pay 100% attention in class. ;)    Aparently, if you read through the work you've done in the day when you get home you remember it better?

UEdNd3a3aa	When multiplying fractions you multiply the numerator (top number) by the numerator  and denominator (bottom number) by denominator.     for example 3 x 4/5     the 3 is the same as saying 3/1 so we have    3/1 x 4/5    now product of 3/1 and 4/5 is      (3x4)/(1x5) = 12/5    if you need to put this in improper fractions then we consider how many times the numerator can be divided by the denominator    in this case the 2  (5x2=10) with 2 left over   so (5x2) + 2 = 12    so our improper fraction is     2 2/5       for your examples you are given     4 x 2/5    step 1:     turn the 4 in to a fraction     4/1    Step 2:     multiply the numerator and the denominator    4/1 x 2/5           (4x2)/(1/5) = 8/5    Step 3:     change to an improper fraction    how many times can 8 be divided by 5?   1 time with 3 remainder     so we have     1 3/5      ______________________________________...    for the second part of you question     it is asking     3 1/8 + ____ = 7    step 1:     change our improper fraction to a fraction    3 1/8 = 25/8    to do this we multiply the whole number (the 3) by the denominator of our fraction     3x8 = 24   now we add the 1 from the fraction 24+1 = 25 and this is over our original denominator (8)      lets do another example     if we have 2 3/4    step 1:     multiply the whole number by the denominator     2 x 4 = 8    add the numerator     8+3 = 11    put our new numerator over our denominator     11/4    check by using the examples in the first  part of the question.       now back to the question     3 1/8 + _____ = 7    we found that 3 1/8 = 25/8    step 2:     rewrite your question     25/8 + ___ = 7    step 3:     change our 7 to a fraction     7 = 7/1    step 4:     rewrite your question     25/8 + ____ = 7/1      lets do a little algebra review before we move on with fractions    if we have 2 + x = 4    to find x we subtract 2 from each side of the equation     2 + x -2 = 4-2    x=2    it is the same with fractions.  so lets return and continue with step 5    Step 5:   I'm going to change our ____ to a y ( so we don't confuse it with the x which we use for multiplying)     Subtract 25/8 from both sides of our equation     25/8 + y - 25/8 = 7/1 -25/8    so now we have     y = 7/1 - 25/8    Step 6:     find the common denominator for 7/1 and 25/8    find the common denominator in this case 8    multiply 7/1 x 8/8 = 56/8    Step 7:     Rewrite your question again     y = 56/8 - 25/8    now we can combine the numerator and the denominator    y = (56-25)/8 = 31/8    Step 6 :  Change to improper fraction     y = 3 7/8      go back now and check     3 1/8 + 3 7/8 = 7    25/8 +  31/ 8 = 7    (25 + 31)/8 = 7    56/8 = 7     7 = 7      Good Luck on your test|`|AA10439008	What do you add to  3 1/8 to make seven  Make the 7 be 7 0/8  Then borrow 8/8 (which equals 1) from the 7 making it be 6 8/8  Then subtract (subtract numerators and numbers in front but leave denominator the same)    6 8/8  -3 1/8  ------------  3 7/8    Like that    On the others; for example  5/6 x7 make the 7 be 7/1 then multiply the numerators AND multiply denominators  5/6 x 7/1 = 35/6 then if you need to, make it a mixed number  35/6 = 5 remainder 5 so it's 5 5/6|`|AA11995384	Well just as 4 x 2 = 8 then 4 x 2/5 = 8/5.  We know that 5/5 = 1 but we have 8/5 which is an extra 3/5.  So the answer to the first question is 1 3/5 (one and three fifths).  The same principle applies to the other 4 questions in this group.      In the second group, the question being asked is effectively, 'What is the difference between one number and another'.  So the first one is really saying, 'What's the difference between 3 1/8 and 7'.  In other words: 7 - 3 1/8.  There are a variety of ways to solve this and for some reason, schools nearly always seem to pick the hardest way!  In the first example, I would split the number 3 1/8 into 2 numbers and take them away from 7 individually.  So 7 -3 = 4, but we also need to take away another 1/8 so 4 - 1/8 =  3 7/8.  Once again, you can apply a similar routine to the other 2.|`|gB5LP70Laa	use a calculator  e.g  1)    4 * 2/5= 4* 2=8 therfore 8/5 which is 1 3/5    2)    2 2/3    3)    5 1/7    4)    5 5/6    5)    1 7/8    3 1/8 to make seven =3 7/8    4 2/7 to make six=1 5/7    5 8/9 to make seven= 1 1/9|`|WOQAbVzbaa	Work out 2/5 (i.e. 0.2) by dividing 2 by 5, then multiply by 4.  Whenever you see a fraction, it is just a simple way of writing a division without having to work it out.    Similarly with the second part, work out the fraction as a decimal, then add the whole number and subtract from the number needed, e.g.  1+8=0.125  3+0.125=3.125  7-3.125=3.875    (if needed, you can then change this back into a mixed number by working out the decimal point as a fraction.  the easy way to do this is to take it away from what you had to start with, i.e. you had 1/8 to start, so 1-1/8=7/8.  Therefore, the answer is 3 7/8)

G5vGTTqhaa	Pros      -- Productivity grows more quickly when countries produce goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage. Living standards can go up faster.    -- Global competition and cheap imports keep a lid on prices, so inflation is less likely to derail economic growth.    -- An open economy spurs innovation with fresh ideas from abroad.    -- Export jobs often pay more than other jobs.    -- Unfettered capital flows give the U.S. access to foreign investment and keep interest rates low.    Cons    -- Millions of Americans have lost jobs due to imports or production shifts abroad. Most find new jobs--that pay less.    -- Millions of others fear losing their jobs, especially at those companies operating under competitive pressure.    -- Workers face pay-cut demands from employers, which often threaten to export jobs.    -- Service and white-collar jobs are increasingly vulnerable to operations moving offshore.    -- U.S. employees can lose their comparative advantage when companies build advanced factories in low-wage countries, making them as productive as those at home.|`|YvGWHIkeaa	your interested in it? then why is it in the HOMEWORK category?    obviously its homework! x

AA10176626	The banking and lending crisis will have no effect on the government's Stafford Lending program for 2009-2010. The US Department of Education is continuing its practice of guaranteeing all Stafford loans, which has the effect of making Stafford loans risk-free for the lender. When there's no risk, there's no worries, and the lenders are more than happy to make Stafford loans - more so than just about any other form of loan.     In fact, hidden deep down within the current stimulus bill is a provision that would increase the amount of "service fees" that the lenders get to charge the government for making Stafford loans. Critics charge that this is yet another example of the government welfare enjoyed by mega-lenders, but the lenders claim they need this increase to make Stafford lending worthwhile.     It's possible that this could benefit borrowers - in the past, when the lenders used to receive higher fees, the lenders would compete on "borrower perks", in order to entice borrowers to borrow from them, rather than the competition. Most of those perks were eliminated when the government slashed lender fees, but if they go back up again, maybe the borrower perks will return. No guarantees there.    As for non-government loans - the private or alternative loans - as of right now, that lending market is still pretty much dead and buried. A handful of banks are making these loans, and they all apply ultra-conservative lending analyses. If you're lucky enough not to be rejected flat out, chances are pretty high that you'll be asked for a cosigner.    Congress and the Administration are well aware of the problem, and there seems to be bipartisan consensus for the need to revitalize the educational lending market. I think you'll see that a significant amount of the bank rescue funds will be destined for student lending. I can't tell you exactly how that's going to work, or how quickly it's going to happen. 2009-2010 may be a very difficult year for any form of student borrowing other than Stafford, Perkins and PLUS loans, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Time will tell how long it will take that train to reach the station.    Good luck, I hope that helped.|`|joplKMsLaa	Not quite sure but I'm guessing grants and scholarships will also be effected.

Dear Sirs,    I am writing to you regarding a correspondence exchange performed in 200X, between children of your school and spanish children (more precisely of XX, XX) that were in the 3rd or 4th grade then.   My name is XX YY ZZ.  I am now 16 years old and now attending a german school. I was one of those spanish children, and my "letter friend's" first name was XX. I never knew his last name.  This e-mail is due to the fact that a few days ago I found one of his letters. I realized it would be very interesting for me (and maybe for him too) to take up contact again and receive correspondence from so far away, even though we never really received more that three letters from the other.  If possible, I would like to ask you for his current address, school or e-mail address. Therefore, I send you the letter I found as an attachment.    Sincerely,    XX

CrgcaGMKaa	An acrostic is a poem or other writing in an alphabetic script, in which the first letter, syllable or word of each line, paragraph or other recurring feature in the text spells out another message. A famous acrostic was made on the Greek for the acclamation JESUS CHRIST, GOD'S SON, SAVIOR which in Greek is: Iesous Christos, Theou Uios, Soter ("ch" and "th" being each one letter in Greek and "u" is also "y"). The initials spell ICHTHUS same as ICHTHYS, Greek for fish; hence the frequent use of the fish by early Christians and up to now as a symbol for Jesus Christ.    Acronyms, initialisms, and alphabetisms are abbreviations that are formed using the initial components in a phrase or name. These components may be individual letters (as in CEO) or parts of words (as in Benelux or Delmarva). There is no universal agreement on the precise definition of the various terms nor on written usage. While popular in recent English, such abbreviations have historical use in English, as well as other languages. As a type of word formation process, acronyms and initialisms are viewed as a subtype of blending.|`|15dA7weiaa	I don't know.|`|g4APbW4Naa	There are a couple different kinds of acrostics.  One is a type of poem where the first letter of each line (or paragraph), when taken together, will spell out a name or a message.      Here is a classic example of acrostic poem in English written by Edgar Allan Poe entitled simply An Acrostic:    Elizabeth it is in vain you say  "Love not"  thou sayest it in so sweet a way:  In vain those words from thee or L.E.L.  Zantippe's talents had enforced so well:  Ah! if that language from thy heart arise,  Breath it less gently forth  and veil thine eyes.  Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried  To cure his love  was cured of all beside   His follie  pride  and passion  for he died.    The first letters of each line spell out "ELIZABETH".    Another type of acrostic is a type of puzzle seen in crossword magazines, where clues are given to words that are placed in numbered spaces - the letters are then transferred to spaces with the corresponding numbers to form a quotation, and the first letters of the answer words usually spell out the author of the quote and the title of the book or material it's from.    An acronym is any abbreviation formed from a combination of first letters that stand for a larger phrase or name.  This can be anything like "BYOB" for "Bring your own beer", or like "POTUS" for "President of the United States".

8a8381b69bfc33f55f9aa21e88782195aa	The Torrijos-Carter Treaties (sometimes referred to in the singular as the Torrijos-Carter Treaty) are two treaties signed by the United States and Panama in Washington, D.C., on September 7, 1977, abrogating the Hay-Bunau Varilla Treaty of 1903. The treaties guaranteed that Panama would gain control of the Panama Canal after 1999, ending the control of the canal that the U.S. had exercised since 1903.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrijos-Ca...        After the war, United States control of the canal and the Canal Zone surrounding it became contentious as relations between Panama and the U.S. became increasingly tense. Many Panamanians felt that the canal zone rightfully belonged to Panama; student protests were met by the fencing in of the zone and an increased military presence.[26] Negotiations toward a new settlement began in 1974, and resulted in the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. Signed by President of the United States Jimmy Carter and Omar Torrijos of Panama on September 7, 1977, this set in motion the process of handing the canal over to Panamanian control. Though controversial within the U.S., the treaty led to full Panamanian control effective at noon on December 31, 1999, and control of the canal was handed over to the Panama Canal Authority (ACP).|`|d32b1689f27b29564eb8aa0c8af16400aa	The Panama Canal was built in Panama by the U.S. in the late 19th century under the Teddy Roosevelt administration. Before this, Panama and Colombia were one nation, but the US supported Panama's revolution against Colombia because they wanted to build the canal. The U.S. made a deal with Panama that they would control the canal for 100 years. In 1999, the 100 years was up, and control was returned to Panama.

e2bb10e6ce9fcc6df1df2046ffe82a9aaa	Como ocorrem os gmeos siameses?    Existem dois tipos de gesta??o gemelar, como a medicina chama a forma??o embrionria de gmeos. O mais comum, que responde por cerca de 2/3 dos casos, surge da fertiliza??o independente de dois vulos diferentes. Nesse caso,  impossvel os bebs nascerem unidos, malforma??o que caracteriza os gmeos coligados (nome cientfico do que popularmente se batizou de "siameses"). Isso s acontece quando um nico vulo  duplamente fecundado. Em geral, em pouco mais de uma semana o embri?o se separa em dois. "Mas se essa divis?o demorar mais que 12 dias, ser tarde demais", afirma a doutora Maria de Lourdes Brizot, do Departamento de Medicina Fetal, do Hospital das Clnicas de S?o Paulo. "As clulas acabar?o formando partes do corpo ou rg?os em comum", diz ela.     Quando isso acontece em partes vitais como pulm?o, cora??o ou crebro, um dos gmeos tem de ser sacrificado. Se n?o, podem ser separados cirurgicamente. O termo "siameses" se originou da primeira ocorrncia registrada desse fen?meno: os gmeos Chang e Eng, que nasceram no Si?o, Tailancia, em 1811, colados pelo ombro. Eles casaram, tiveram 22 filhos e permaneceram unidos at o fim de seus dias           Considerando os padr?es bsicos ou comuns de reprodu??o, podemos destacar alguns casos especiais, que constituem varia??es das modalidades reprodutivas normalmente conhecidas. Discorreremos, ent?o, sobre os casos de partenognese e poliembrionia.       A partenognese O termo partenognese (do grego parthenos: virgem/ genesis: origem) designa o fen?meno biolgico em que o gameta feminino (vulo) de certos animais se desenvolvem formando um novo indivduo, sem que tenha sido fecundado.   Trata-se de um caso atpico de reprodu??o sexuada, uma vez que para se processar necessita da forma??o de um gameta.   Um caso muito comum de partenognese verifica-se entre as abelhas. nesses animais, as abelhas-rainhas --- fmeas frteis -- produzem vulos haplides que podem ou n?o ser fecundados pelos espermatozides dos zang?es -- machos frteis. Os vulos fecundados normalmente ao se desenvolver originam somente fmeas, que s?o diplides (2n) e podem ser representadas por abelhas operrias ou rainha. Por sua vez, os vulos haplides n?o fecundados tem a chance de se desenvolver por partenognese e originar somente zang?es, que s?o, portanto, igualmente haplides.     A poliembrionia -- Fen?meno em que se verifica a forma??o de vrios embri?es a partir de um nico zigoto. Nesse caso, no incio do desenvolvimento embrionrio ocorre separa??o de clulas em dois ou mais grupos; cada grupo poder se desenvolver e formar um novo indivduo. como todos os indivduos assim formados s?o provenientes de um mesmo zigoto, conclui-se que todos eles ter?o a mesma constitui??o gentica; logo, ser?o necessariamente do mesmo sexo. Esse  o caso dos chamados gmeos univitelinos ou monozigticos, tambm conhecidos como gmeos verdadeiros.   Mas a poliembrionia nem sempre  a responsvel pela forma??o de gmeos. Na espcie humana, por exemplo, uma mulher pode liberar dois ou mais vulos durante uma nica ovula??o. (Ovula??o  o fen?meno em que o vulo  expelido do ovrios; em seguida, ele passa para o interior da trompa uteriana). Nesse caso, sendo esses vulos fecundados, formam-se os gmeos bivitelinos ou dizigticos, tambm conhecidos como gmeos falsos ou gmeos fraternos. Assim, vulos distintos s?o fecundados por espermatozides tambm distintos, originando zigotos igualmente distintos. Por essa raz?o, esses gmeos diferem geneticamente um do outro, da mesma maneira que quaisquer irm?os nascidos em partos diferentes. Logo n?o precisam ser necessariamente do mesmo sexo, j que s?o portadores de patrim?nios genticos diferentes.

Mas, mesmo na ocorrncia deste fato, h duas alternativas. A primeira possibilidade  a de que cada ovrio libere um vulo, ou apenas um dos ovrios libere sozinho dois vulos, ambos aptos a serem fecundados. Se dois espermatozides distintos conseguirem penetrar os dois vulos maduros, estar?o formadas duas clulas-ovo diferentes, dois gmeos. Tem sido demonstrada uma outra possibilidade, que tambm se enquadra nesse caso:  a de que, em condi??es excepcionais, exista mais de um vulo dentro de um s folculo. Assim, com o rompimento do folculo no momento da matura??o, h mais de um vulo que pode ser fecundado e dar origem a gmeos. De qualquer forma, nas duas hipteses, os dois vulos s?o fecundados independentemente por dois espermatozides diferentes. Os gmeos formados assim, que podem ser dois ou mais, ser?o t?o semelhantes entre si quanto irm?os comuns, filhos do mesmo pai e m?e. Por isso, s?o chamados gmeos fraternos (70% dos casos), e a cincia os cataloga como bivitelinos (do latim bi = dois; vitellum = gema de ovo), ou trivitelinos etc. Eles s?o chamados tambm de falsos gmeos e poder?o ser do mesmo sexo ou de sexos opostos.  No momento em que o folculo amadurece, n?o  ainda um vulo completo que  liberado, mas o ocito; o ocito divide-se celularmente e origina apenas um vulo. Se, em condi??es especiais, o ocito for fecundado antes de estar completa a divis?o celular, surge a segunda possibilidade de forma??o de gmeos. O ocito, penetrado pelo espermatozide, divide-se em dois e origina duas clulas-ovo, prontas para se desenvolver em dois embri?es. Como resultam de uma nica clula inicial, os gmeos formados assim s?o idnticos. A cincia os cataloga como univitelinos (de uma s gema) e eles s?o chamados pela linguagem popular, de "gmeos verdadeiros". S?o sempre do mesmo sexo e fisicamente iguais, exceto nas impress?es digitais. Possuem iguais grupos sangneos e, a nica prova absoluta para o univitelismo  que os enxertos de pele recprocos n?o s?o nunca rejeitados. Os gmeos idnticos tm a mesma carga gentica, o DNA absolutamente igual. Se eles tm a mesma carga gentica, obviamente eles v?o ter a mesma propens?o, o mesmo tipo de defesa organica, o mesmo tipo de submiss?o, vamos dizer assim,  doen?as iguais.    REVESTIMENTOS FETAIS   Nos casos de gmeos bivitelinos, ou fraternos, a placenta  sempre dupla, ou seja, cada um tem desenvolvimento quase independente, com sua prpria nutri??o e circula??o individual. J nos casos de gmeos idnticos, a placenta pode ser nica ou dupla, e ent?o aparecem os casos de gesta??o univitelina dicorial, isto , com dois crions, e monocorial, com um s crion para os dois fetos. O crion  a membrana fibrosa da placenta, que se coloca entre esta e o amnio. O amnio, por sua vez, uma membrana fina e transparente,  um "saco de celofane" que forma a chamada "bolsa d'agua". Assim, quando h duas placentas, h tambm dois crions e dois amnios. Quando a placenta  s uma para os dois fetos, a circula??o sangnea  muito caracterstica, pois a irriga??o chega at os dois vinda de uma s fonte e atravs de um s caminho. A divis?o precisa ser homognea, caso contrrio um dos dois fetos sai prejudicado, em beneficio do outro. Nesse caso, um deles se desenvolve como se fosse parasita do outro, pois recebe parte da nutri??o que se destinaria a seu gmeo. As vezes, ocorre que, apesar de terem sido gerados dois embri?es, apenas um se desenvolve; o outro estaciona, pressionado pelo maior. Em alguns casos mesmo, n?o chega a formar o cora??o, nem o sistema nervoso, nem a assumir a forma humana. Aparece, por ocasi?o do parto, como uma massa de tecido, informe, confundido com freqncia como um pequeno tumor benigno da placenta.  Os gmeos e suas histrias ainda s?o um desafio para a cincia. J  certo que h um componente gentico, hereditrio, mas ningum descobriu ainda como isso acontece. Por estatstica, h chance maior de nascimento de gmeos quando a mulher fica grvida depois dos 30 anos. Outro fator  o uso da plula anticoncepcional. Nmeros tambm mostram a influncia das caractersticas raciais: entre as mulheres orientais, por exemplo, a incidncia de gmeos  menor: 1 caso a cada 150 nascimentos. Nas mulheres brancas, a taxa aumenta: 1 caso a cada 100 nascimentos. A maior incidncia est entre as mulheres negras: 1 caso a cada 80 nascimentos. As mulheres negras s?o mais fecundas porque elas produzem, em maior quantidade, o horm?nio folculo estimulante, conhecido pela sigla FSH. O aumento desse horm?nio provoca maior ovula??o. Em vez de ter uma ovula??o em cada ciclo menstrual, elas poderiam ter duas ou trs ovula??es.  Com a chegada do ultra-som o aparelho que permite a vis?o do feto e at sua movimenta??o no tero da m?e - para o Brasil, h 15 anos - a confirma??o da concep??o de gmeos passou a ser possvel logo nos primeiros meses de gravidez. Alm disso, atravs do o ultra-som,  possvel verificar as posi??es em que os fetos se encontram no tero materno.  Nos ltimos dez anos, foi registrado um notvel aumento no nascimento de gmeos e principalmente de univitelinos (idnticos). O fen?meno  atribudo as novas drogas usadas contra a infertilidade (clomifen e gonadotrofina da menopausa humana) e aos sofisticados mtodos de "concep??o assistida", baseados na fecunda??o "in vitro". As drogas anti-infertilidade estimulam o ovrio a produ??o de mais de um vulo maduro em cada ciclo.

d585a9d0f339fdd3033d10ee21ff02a0aa	The term "globalization" is used to refer to these collective changes as a process, or else as the cause of turbulent change. The distinct uses include:    Economically, socially and ecologically positive: As an engine of commerce; one which brings an increased standard of living  prosperity  to developing countries and further wealth to First World and Third World countries.   Economically, socially, and ecologically negative: As an engine of "corporate imperialism;" one which tramples over human rights in developing societies, claims to bring prosperity, yet often simply amounts to plundering and profiteering. Negative effects include cultural assimilation via cultural imperialism, the export of artificial wants, and the destruction or inhibition of authentic local and global community, ecology and cultures.   It is often argued that even terrorism has undergone globalization, with attacks in foreign countries that have no direct relation with the attackers' own country.[4][5]    Since World War II, barriers to international trade have been considerably lowered through international agreements such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Particular initiatives carried out as a result of GATT and the WTO, for which GATT is the foundation, have included:    Promotion of free trade   Of goods:   Reduction or elimination of tariffs; construction of free trade zones with small or no tariffs   Reduced transportation costs, especially from development of containerization for ocean shipping.   Of capital: reduction or elimination of capital controls   Reduction, elimination, or harmonization of subsidies for local businesses   Intellectual property restrictions   Harmonization of intellectual property laws across nations (generally speaking, with more restrictions)   Supranational recognition of intellectual property restrictions (e.g. patents granted by China would be recognized in the US)|`|AA12137059	http://en.wikipedia.org   Search it and you'll get the best answer.|`|cd5d8dc8da8563dc9bfd08c93c394a05aa	There's no advantages.

Both r same. In North they cal BBM ,where as in Southern states its BBA.. which is an UG course,now very popular...!!! It wil contain some accounts   paper n even economics.. but nothin too scary. Those wil b jus basics not higer level... But if u r takin dis course ur opportuinties of takin up ur PG courses wil b quite narrowed coz u hav to seek mostly MBA n not of other fields..  U can try takin B.Com...or Law... LAW is one of d best and intresting course now available... it really has a vrey bright future.. Its not only courts n advocates now, there r so many jobs 4 law students. There r special entarnces coundected by national law schools,and also by other pvt colleges.U now hav 2 check in sites n find it out...|`|034b970debe3833a4107b75b75c71c50aa	U hav opted for al professional subjects so hav wide varitey to pot for degree courses..    Bt the best thing is to go for regular college degree courses.If u wana go in IT realted thn u can opt BCA n latr on do MCA along..  If u wana be in managerial line then u can go for BBA,BBA(CAM) or u can can honours in Eco.    If you are good in accounts then CA/CWA are very good options, but they are rigorous courses which require a high degree of commitment.     An MBA also offers a wide range of employment opportunities (which can be done after BCOM) but you must make a strong effort to make it through the management entrance tests.   Law is an excellent option which also offers a wide range of career options.   CS with Law offers excellent prospects in corporate law.     If you are not keen to study for more than a couple of years then pursuing MCom is a good idea, but you have to be an excellent student if you wish to have a bargaining position for employment as there aren't really any specialised jobs for individuals with an M Com degree.    There are no short-cuts to success, so you must align your personality, strengths and abilities with your goals in life.|`|7922a56bb4bbdb4bd8c4d58b4c871f98aa	the best is commerce

Es k?nnte z.B. sein, dass der Autor dieser Zeilen lediglich einen Text von einer Frau gelesen hat, die sich "Lustfrau" nannte....    Hie?e es an dieser Stelle "von", so wrde ich das eine Nuance anders verstehen, in diesem Falle w?re es wohl eher so, dass der Autor die Lustfrau pers?nlich kennt und von ihr inspiriert wurde - wie bereits von "MadWutz" angemerkt: also im Sinne einer Muse.

SIhxrxD3aa	Where you actually attend school for undergrad has no impact on whether or not the vet school will accept you.  If Georgia tech has all the required classes then you are considered exactly the same as someone from UGA.    However, going to UGA might be advantageous for other reasons.  Most likely UGA will have more pre-vet students and probably a very active pre-vet club.  You will probably get more informal exposure to vet med by participating in that kind of club and you will get to become acquainted with the vet school and even some of the clinicians.  But, if you are planning to go into research as a veterinarian and you feel that Georgia tech has a better biology program or will provide you more research experience or you think that they have a better undergraduate atmosphere in general then you can sure go to Georgia Tech with no problem.|`|AA12021966	I'd go to UGA if I were you.

23e56b78adf7e68681e320826b9f2b1faa	SAT 2 Lit is basically a reading comprehension test on steroids. It tests reading comprehension of poetry and short prose pieces. It also asks questions involving meter and various literary terminology (figurative language, anaphora, that kind of thing.) If there's an AP Lit or Language teacher at your school, ask them for a list of vocab needed for the AP test and that should correspond pretty well to the Lit Subject test.    I took AP Language last year and found that to be pretty good preparation for the test; meter just tripped me up. I have no rhythm.    Good luck!

AA11289213	iTunes is a proprietary digital media player application, launched by Apple Computer on January 9, 2001 at MacWorld Expo San Francisco 2001, for playing and organizing digital music and video files. The program is also an interface to manage the music on Apple's popular iPod digital audio player. Additionally, iTunes can connect to the iTunes Music Store (sometimes referred to as "iTMS") which allows users to purchase digital music and movie files that can be played by iPods and iTunes.    iTunes has gained and maintained a reputation for being easy to use while still providing many features for obtaining, organizing, and playing music. The program is freely downloadable, bundled with all Mac computers and iPods, and supplied with Mac OS X. It is also offered as part of the iLife application suite.    iTunes is supported on computers running Mac OS X, Windows 2000 and Windows XP operating systems, however it also runs on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista. Apple have also developed a version which runs on mobile phones such as the Motorola ROKR and Motorola SLVR.

Plot Summary:    Lennie is a large, physically strong man with the mind of a child, and George is a smaller, feeble bodied man with quick wit. The men are wondering ranch workers who travel together in search of any available opportunities to earn money. The ideal objective of most ranch workers is to amass a sizeable fortune and eventually purchase a small farm, and "live offa the fatta the lan'." Lennie is driven to reach this objective by the prospect of "tending the rabbits". However, this goal appears to be nothing more than a distant dream until Candy, another worker on the farm, offers to contribute his savings for a place on the farm.    While subjected to the loneliness and mediocrity of the life they presently lead, George and Lennie's prospect of their own farm attracts yet another hopeful, Crooks, the "Negro" stable buck. Despite their best efforts, however, the dream begins to collapse, completely falling apart when Lennie accidentally kills the wife of Curley, a fellow-worker and son of the ranch boss. After Curley's wife, who is a promiscuous woman with a wandering eye, dies in his arms, Lennie escapes to the river where the story had begun, the place where George advised him to hide should he ever get into trouble (Note the circular ending: it suggests that the workers are trapped in the cycle forever).    To spare Lennie from Curley's revenge, which would entail much pain on Lennie's part, George quickly kills Lennie with a Luger pistol which he had stolen from Carlson earlier. He does this by coaxing Lennie with a description of the dream of their own farm, which captivates his attention and allows George to press the pistol to the back of Lennie's unsuspecting head and shoot him. Slim and George then take George for a drink to settle his nerves. The last line of the book is delivered by Carlson, the ranch worker who kills Candy's old dog in a fashion similar to Lennie's killing (which foreshadows his death.) He says to Curley, "Now what the hell do you suppose is eatin' them two guys?" reflecting the fact that both characters never learned the value of compassion and friendship.    --------------------------------------...  Characters in "Of Mice and Men"  George  Dark haired, cynical ranch hand. He looks after Lennie and dreams of a better life. George's last name, Milton, is a reference to "Paradise Lost" scribe John Milton. The epic poem's themes and title tie into the themes of "Of Mice And Men"-- man's lost hopes and dreams.     Lennie  Travels with George. He is a giant of a man who is unaware of his own strength. His mental deficiency culminates in an obsession to stroke 'soft' materials: this can be understood to represent his need for human contact, which is shown in his obsession with rabbits.     Candy  Is the swamper. He lost a hand while working on the ranch. He owns a very old dog who was shot at the hand of Carlson.     Curley  An unpleasant curly-haired character. He often picks fights and detests large people; mainly Lennie. During the book he picks a fight with Lennie for no reason. Lennie initially does not defend himself and takes the beating but finally grabs and crushes Curley's hand.     Curley's Wife  A young, pretty woman; sometimes called a "tart" by the men. She doesn't have a name (a reflection on how women were treated as second class citizens at the time of the book's setting) and is the only woman mentioned on the male-oriented ranch. She often flirts with the ranch men as a cry for attention and secretly hates her husband. Like George and Lennie she had dreams that were eventually crushed. She is accidentally killed by Lennie.     Slim  The moral yardstick at the ranch. All the other characters respect him, as he has an omniscient and omnipotent presence. Curley suspects he is having an affair with his wife.     Crooks  The only black person on the ranch. He is discriminated against and has to sleep alone behind the stables. He is possibly the most intelligent man on the ranch. But later we see some of the discrimination wiped away as he plays horseshoes with the other ranch workers (even though he has a crooked back)     Carlson  A large and insensitive man. He shoots Candy's dog and doesn't understand emotions such as compassion.     Whit  A young man; enthusiastic about life on the ranch, and is a regular visitor to the brothel.     The Boss  Only appears once. He is Curley's father and runs the ranch.|`|AA12359885	You have 6 reviews to choose from.    http://www.freebooknotes.com/book.php3?i...

Plot Overview    Two migrant workers, George and Lennie, have been let off a bus miles away from the California farm where they are due to start work. George is a small, dark man with sharp, strong features. Lennie, his companion, is his opposite, a giant of a man with a shapeless face. Overcome with thirst, the two stop in a clearing by a pool and decide to camp for the night. As the two converse, it becomes clear that Lennie has a mild mental disability, and is deeply devoted to George and dependent upon him for protection and guidance. George finds that Lennie, who loves petting soft things but often accidentally kills them, has been carrying and stroking a dead mouse. More..    http://www.freebooknotes.com/page.php?li...

d9765ff5c0e096515d50dd31ec9b2f45aa	The view of self is very different than in western cultures. And this view has been widely accepted before the western influences.   Hindu culture is based on a religion(hinduism) that is a mixture of the Indo-Aryan nomad's religion(polyteism) and the local religions (mostly animism.)  Since the nomad culture had a better developed language, and therefore more organized, they became the more dominant subclass. Since they had lighter skin, they were able to better differentiate between members of the different subclasses.   The religion that came to be from the mixture of these two types of culture, is a religion that is based upon reincarnation. It could be debated that this element of the religion might have been 'created' or evolved in order for the suppressed class to have hope in a better life, and to not give up on the current one. Or another approach might be that the dominant class inserted this element into the religion to have control over the suppressed class.   Now, the fact that there haven't been too much organized uprisings between the different casts, is an indication that the belief in reincarnation and the perpetuation of "self" into another life has been a very strong one. This belief has been 'shaken' after the presence of the western world. Statistically there has been much more conversions to christian religions in the lower casts that in the upper casts.    To summarize this down: The view of self in the Indian Caste system is very different than the western view. The self is analyzed in the context of many lifetimes. The belief in the reincarnation keeps the lower caste members functioning because 1.) They have hope, and 2.) There are elements of the idea of Karma, which is behavior that is exceptable in the religion (and practical in the society) If the person behaves properly, or better, then he/she might get reincarnated into a higher caste individual.     This is all I know. I studied this in a college level course.

Radiation from the sun passes through the glass and is absorbed inside the greenhouse, warming things up, but heat radiated from the things inside the greenhouse is not able to pass through the glass and escape, glass is opaque to that waveband, so the greenhouse becomes much warmer inside than the world is outside.

aaf30bfb1c003ef5bf756f92a397da4baa	About Writing Mississippi Trial, 1955 by Chris Crowe    The idea for the novel came as a complete surprise to me. I was working on a book (Presenting Mildred D. Taylor) about Newbery medalist Mildred D. Taylor, and in an autobiographical essay of hers, she mentioned the impact the murder of Emmett Till had on her when she was a child. At the time, I had never heard of Emmett Till, so I had no idea what she was talking about. I knew I had to at least find out who he was in case it turned out to be something that influenced her own writing, something I should include in my book about Taylor.   I was stunned by what I found: the article in Jet Magazine that contained an article about the murder case and a photo of the battered corpse of Emmett Till in his casket. The more I read, the more shocked, for many reasons, I was. I was shocked I had never heard of a case that was as widely covered in 1955 as this one was. I was shocked at the terrible nature of the crime. I was shocked that this case is virtually forgotten in the teaching of U.S. history. The murder of Emmett Till and the sham trial of his murderers was the trigger to the Civil Rights movement. Emmett was killed in August 1955; the trial concluded at the end of September 1955. On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks refused to move from her seat on a public bus in Montgomery, Alabama. The cause-and-effect relationship of these events was clear to me, as it is to most African American historians.    Anyway, I wanted American teenagers to know this story and its important place in American history, and I decided historical fiction would be a great way for them to learn about it. But I knew a novel couldn't be just about the murder case; it had to be about something else, something that ultimately is affected by Emmett's murder but is a story essentially separate from the murder. I didn't know what that would be, so I buried the idea in my subconscious and started the historical research. I did lots and lots of reading about the Civil Rights movement, about Jim Crow Mississippi, and about the murder (especially from two books, Death in the Delta and Emmett Till: Sacrificial Lamb of the Civil Rights Movement).    I went to Mississippi on the very same day in August that Emmett Till had arrived, and stayed there for several days, visiting the sites he had been in, the store where he insulted Carolyn Bryant, driving Old Money Road up to the Tallahatchie River. I spent hours in the Greenwood Public Library reading and photocopying microfilm from The Greenwood Commonwealth and The Morning Star, two local papers that covered the case. I talked with people. I took photos. I read books in local libraries about Mississippi life and history. I took notes and made tape recordings to document how people in Leflore and Tallahatchie Counties acted, what things looked and smelled like, how Mississippi speech sounded. I stayed up late at night rereading my notes and research and freewriting in my journal about what I was learning and how it might fit into a novel.    When I came back, I started writing. It was slow at first because I had no idea where the novel was going. I probably wrote fifteen different "Chapter Ones" and all of them ended up in the trash. I had all the information on the Emmett Till case that I needed, but I didn't have a story. That's when my own past came forward and bit me. When I was a teenager, even when I was 14 like Emmett, I was a smart-aleck, a wisecracker who thought I was much smarter than I actually was. It was around that time that I started resenting my dad--for no good reason at all, except for mindless adolescence. He wasn't perfect, and of course neither was I, but he was a wonderful father who made huge sacrifices for me, my brothers, and my sister. As a stupid teenager, though, I didn't see any of his good qualities and instead magnified his human faults. I was an idiot, an ungrateful, stupid teenager, but at the time my own stupidity was invisible to me. I have always regretted those opportunities I missed as a teenager to develop a close, honest, and loving relationship with my own father.    At the time I started work on this book, I had a teenage son of my own, Jonathan. I love Jonathan, I have loved him from the moment he was born. When he was little, he and I had a wonderfully close relationship, but when he turned into a teenager, that genetic father-son rift started, and I could feel him beginning to pull away from me. It was awful poetic justice: my own son doing to me what I had done to my father. I desperately wanted to break that stupid cycle but didn't know how. Fortunately, Jonathan did. When he was in eighth grade, he asked me to teach him how to lift weights (I'm an old, very old jock, but in my day was a good athlete and devoted weightlifter). I took him to the university weight room and showed him how to work out, and we worked out together. That led to a regular routine for us, and Jonathan and I spent two nights a week lifting weights together for the next six years. And the best part was that we didn't just lift weights, we also talked about life, girls, school, college, our family, everything that mattered and lots of things that didn't matter. That shared time I spent with my only son is now some of the most precious time I have had on this earth.    So, when I thought about what really mattered to me--and what should matter most to every father and son--I realized that the relationship between a father and son is sometimes the most neglected relationship in our society. I knew that I had enough personal pleasure and pain in that department to write a novel about it, and so, Hiram Hillburn doesn't get along with his father. Hiram's father doesn't get along with Hiram's grandfather--the generational rift between father and son is clear, and Hiram will have the chance to recognize it and do something about it.

But I'd change the wording around teachers know about these places on the internet.  http://www.megaessays.com/viewpaper/2691...  If you have ever read Jonathan Edwards Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God and Benjamin Franklins The Autobiography you will clearly see a difference in their ideas concerning moral perfection. You will notice one of them has a very pushy, forceful way of presenting their views, Jonathan Edward, and one has a more laid back, easy going way of presenting their views, Benjamin Franklin. Just in the way in which they present their views tells a great deal about their actual views. Jonathan Edwards has a very religious, traditional view of moral perfection while Benjamin Franklin has a more ideological and simple way of viewing moral perfection.|`|AA11644641	u have an essay due tomorrow!!??? and ur think about those books!!?? child, id take a Dr. Suess book, cuz thats the only book ull finish b4 tomorrow|`|6580631256ebc09ac2bbd9897d9a2f1aaa	Did you read the books????

Here's the sermon "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" if you don't already have it:  http://edwards.yale.edu/images/pdf/sinne...    Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God is a sermon given by Johnathan Edwards...he scared the congregation so much that many people had to walk out of the church. He used fear to make the people realise that they're way of living isn't right.  He used mainly imagery to get his point across to the congregation.    I wish I could tell you about The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin but I haven't read it...hope this helped at least a little...good luck with your essay!!!!

O uso de agentes biolgicos em conflitos  t?o antigo quanto a humanidade. Mas agora microorganismos e toxnas s?o colocados em bombas e transformdos em armas de destrui??o maci?a. Pesquisas estimuladas depois da 2a Guerra Mundial, e principalmente depois do advento da engenharia gentica, transformaram a biologia em arma t?o letal quanto a nuclear. Para falar sobre esse tema Ser Mdico entrevistou o professor Roque Monteleone Neto, perito da Comiss?o Especial da ONU (Unscom), rg?o responsvel pelo desmantelamento e destrui??o do arsenal de armas nucleares, qumicas e biolgicas do Iraque.     Ser Mdico: Quais s?o os agentes biolgicos usados como armas de guerra?    Roque Monteleone Neto: Em princpio, qualquer agente infeccioso pode ser transformado em arma de guerra - bactrias, fungos, toxinas e vrus que produzam danos sobre a sade humana, animal e das plantas e que possam ser produzidos em grande quantidade. Existem alguns agentes de preferncia como aquele que causa o carbnculo (Bacillus anthracis). Existem trs formas de carbnculo, de acordo com a maneira que ocorreu o contato: a cutanea, a gastrointestinal e a pulmonar. As formas gastrointestinal e pulmonar s?o as mais graves, ocorrendo a morte logo aps os primeiros sintomas. H tambm o bacilo do botulismo (Clostridium botulinum) que produz uma neurotoxina, que  a substancia de maior poder txico entre todas as conhecidas. A sua dose letal  calculada como sendo da ordem da milsima parte de um miligrama     Ser: Como se pode diferenciar rapidamente os diferentes agentes?     Roque: De um modo geral, n?o existe sintomatologia especfica que caracterize uma ou outra infec??o.  evidente que se pode fazer o diagnstico diferencial com o auxlio de exames de laboratrio. Mas os sintomas s?o muito parecidos. Alguns agentes causam hemorragias outros n?o, mas no geral  tudo muito parecido.    Ser: Do ponto de vista de efeitos, quais s?o as diferen?as sintomatolgicas de uma arma qumica e de uma arma biolgica?    Roque: A arma biolgica feita com bactria produz uma doen?a infecciosa. Com uma arma biolgica feita com uma toxina a diferen?a s vezes  difcil de estabelecer, tanto que algumas toxnas pertencem ao grupo de armas qumicas e outras ao de armas biolgicas. Com um agente biolgico - uma bactria ou um vrus - os sintomas s?o de uma doen?a infecciosa, enquanto que na arma qumica  de uma intoxica??o grave, porm esta  apenas uma generaliza??o, que pode ser enganosa, pois existem muitas exce??es.    Ser: Alm desses, quais outros agentes biolgicos foram usados como armas em guerras?    Roque: A varola foi usada em conflitos no passado. N?o dentro de uma bomba como hoje. No sculo passado, durante a conquista de territrios dos ndios na Amrica do Norte, as tropas inglesas "presentearam" os ndios com roupas contaminadas com o vrus da varola, provocando uma epidemia. Muitos agentes j foram estudados , como o bacilo da gangrena gasosa (Clostridium perfringens), que causa uma srie de altera??es importantes no tecido muscular, choque, insuficincia renal e morte em menos de 2 dias. O vibri?o do clera (Vibrio cholera) tambm j foi usado pelos japoneses em atos de sabotagem contra os chineses, no incio da dcada dos anos 30.

Roque: Em primeiro lugar, requer o domnio de uma tecnologia para produ??o em grande escala. Pode ser lan?ada por um mssil, uma bomba area, um avi?o pulverizador, um helicptero ou um navio que tenha um mecanismo de dispers?o de partculas com estes agentes. J a coloca??o de agentes dentro de um artefato explosivo  mais sofisticada. Essa tecnologia foi desenvolvida aps a 2a Guerra Mundial. Exige um esfor?o tecnolgico maior para que se tenha a possibilidade de lan?ar um projtil  longa distancia, explod-lo sobre um determinado alvo, sobretudo fazer com que calor produzido pela detona??o n?o afete a viabilidade dos microorganismos que a bomba carrega em seu interior e, por ltimo, que seja produzida uma nuvem de gotculas com os agentes biolgicos que ir contaminar seres humanos, animais ou plantas.    Ser: A dispers?o dos agentes  praticamente invisvel e de difcil percep??o. J dispomos de tecnologia capaz de detectar o uso destas armas em tempo de evitar maiores estragos?    Roque: Para a detec??o de agentes qumicos, certas tecnologias modernas permitem o lan?amento de um feixe de laser em uma nuvem suspeita e imediatamente se tem informa??es sobre a composi??o qumica dessa nuvem. Em rela??o aos agentes biolgicos isso n?o existe, a detec??o  uma quest?o de tempo, e a identifica??o precisa do microorganismo pode demorar muito.  preciso recolher amostras em meios de cultura adequados, levar para o laboratrio e esperar que os microorganismos se reproduzam para poder identific-lo.

"Man kann (und soll) seine Kultur nicht verleugnen"    Gemeint ist damit, dass zu den Wurzeln unserer Kultur alles geh?rt, das Gute und das weniger Gute. Neues Konstruktives kann nur entstehen, wenn man in der eigenen Kultur verwurzelt ist.    Bezogen auf die Musik bringt es der ?sterreicher Rainer Krispel auf den Punkt:    "Begreift man gute Popmusik als eine Mischung aus geistiger und knstlerischer Verwurzelung (oder wenigstens einer Reflexion bzw. Kenntnis der Wurzeln) und bewusst betriebener Entwurzelung, als den Triumph, der unanhaltbar dahinflie?enden Zeit einen Moment abzuringen, der mitunter ein (knstlerisches) Leben andauern kann, ergibt sich aus der Geschichtslosigkeit, aus dem Fehlen verinnerlichter Referenzmodelle notgedrungen die Perspektivlosigkeit, die v?llige Beliebigkeit so vieler heimischer Popmusiker. Die Besinnung auf Punk- und Post-Punk- bzw. New-Wave-Traditionen und -Ans?tze fhrte in den letzten Jahren in den USA, in Gro?britannien und anderswo zu einer wahren Flut an oft aufregenden neuen Bands."

Desde cedo interessou-se pela poltica e pela literatura e ,como era de praxe nestas circunstancias, foi estudar Direito no Recife, formando-se em 1908. Entre 1911 e 1929 exerceu o cargo de procurador geral em seu estado. Ao lan?ar, em 1922, o ensaio A Paraba e seus problemas, obteve alguma repercuss?o nos meios letrados da regi?o. Porm, em 1928, sacudiria o pas com a publica??o de A bagaceira. Cansada da agita??o modernista, a juventude intelectual brasileira viu no romance a plataforma de um novo tipo de arte.    Para Jos Amrico, contudo, o transito da literatura para a poltica (e vice-versa) continuava ininterruptamente. Ele foi secretrio do Interior e Justi?a, durante os dois anos do governo Jo?o Pessoa, cujo assassinato desencadeou a Revolu??o de 30. Aps a vitria dos revolucionrios, Getlio Vargas o convocou para o Ministrio de Via??o e Obras Pblicas. Em 1937, candidatou-se  Presidncia da Repblica, mas as elei??es foram suprimidas pelo Estado Novo. Retirou-se ent?o provisoriamente da poltica. Em 1945, vingando-se de quem o sabotara, deu famosa entrevista a Carlos Lacerda, pedindo o fim da ditadura getulista. A matria n?o foi censurada, por uma manobra de Lacerda, e acabou sendo, pelos desdobramentos que ocasionou, a gota d'gua na derrubada da ditadura. Isso n?o o impediu de voltar  condi??o de ministro, no segundo governo de Vargas. Quanto  literatura, tentou inutilmente repetir o sucesso de seu primeiro romance com Boqueir?o (1935) e Coiteiros (1936). De certa forma, o escritor fora destrudo pela vida pblica.    Obra principal: A bagaceira (1928)    RESUMO    Durante uma terrvel seca, os retirantes sertanejos, Valentim Pereira, sua filha, Soledade, e um agregado, Pirunga, buscam abrigo no engenho de Dagoberto Mar?ao, "coronel" rico, vivo e dominador no velho estilo patriarcal, e que tem um nico filho, Lcio, estudante de Direito no Recife. Entre Lcio e Soledade brota um forte afeto, mas o rapaz hesita em dar plena seqncia ao flerte por n?o ter convic??o de que seria capaz de am-la no contexto urbano e intelectualizado onde ele, Lcio, vivia.    O filho do "coronel" volta aos estudos, porm ao retornar  propriedade do pai, em novas frias, descobre que Soledade fora seduzida. Em princpio, Valentim, o pai da jovem, sup?e que o sedutor  o feitor do engenho e termina por assassin-lo, de acordo com os rgidos cdigos sertanejos. Lcio se oferece para defender Valentim, que est preso, e lhe comunica que deseja casar-se com Soledade. Entretanto, como numa tragdia grega, vem a terrvel revela??o: a mo?a perdera a virgindade com Dagoberto. O "coronel" e a mo?a fogem ent?o para a propriedade de Valentim, no sert?o paraibano. O agregado Pirunga os acompanha, porm - assumindo a idia de vingan?a em nome da honra sertaneja - acaba provocando a morte do senhor de engenho.    Lcio assume o controle do engenho, interrompe o circuito da vingan?a(1) e d incio  moderniza??o da propriedade que fora de seu pai, tanto em termos produtivos quanto em termos sociais. Anos mais tarde, em outra seca, Soledade, completamente envelhecida, deixa sob a prote??o de Lcio, um menino, que era filho de Dagoberto.    O QUE OBSERVAR EM A BAGACEIRA    A) O relato abre o ciclo do romance de 30 entre outras raz?es por sua for?a de denncia dos horrores gerados pela seca.    B) Importante notar o prefcio que, como em muitas obras inaugurais, vale tanto ou mais do que prprio texto narrativo. Destaque para o espanto do escritor face s mazelas: "H uma misria maior do que morrer de fome no deserto:  n?o Ter o que comer na terra de Cana?."    C) H um choque de trs vis?es que correspondem a trs processos scio-culturais distintos:    1) Vis?o rstica dos sertanejos, com seu sentido tico arcaico.  2) Vis?o brutal e autoritria do senhor de engenho, representando a velha oligarquia.  3) Vis?o civilizada (moderna, urbana) de Lcio, traduzindo um novo comportamento de fundo burgus e que logo seria autorizado pela Revolu??o de 30.    D) Significativo  o projeto modernizador de Lcio ao assumir o comando do engenho: alfabetiza??o dos filhos dos trabalhadores, melhores condi??es de habita??o, etc. Ou seja, aquilo que Getlio Vargas proporia nos anos seguintes como alternativa para o pas.    E) Estilisticamente o livro apresenta uma mistura (mal resolvida) de linguagem tradicional - dominada por um tom desagradavelmente sentencioso - com um gosto modernista por elipses e imagens soltas, e ainda pelo uso de algumas express?es coloquiais ou regionais.    F) Fora sua notvel importancia histrica, A bagaceira  um romance frustrado por causa do excesso de anlise sociolgica.  como se a ansia do autor em tudo explicar, destrusse todo e qualquer efeito sugestivo da narrativa. Lus Costa Lima explicitou bem esse defeito: " A falha central do novelista  a sua incapacidade de ultrapassar o realismo mais primrio."

Von Klima?nderungen werden v.a. die allgemeine Zirkulation der Atmosph?re, Luftdruck, Temperatur und Niederschlag betroffen, wobei vielf?ltige, auch Rckkopplungseffekte enthaltende Wechselwirkungen bestehen. Neben den natrlichen Klima?nderungen, bedingt u.a. durch Variabilit?t der Sonneneinflsse (v.a. Ver?nderungen der Strahlungsbilanz) und Vulkaneruptionen (Verst?rkung der stratosph?rischen Aerosolschicht), gibt es vom Menschen verursachte (anthropogene Klima?nderungen), v.a. durch Energiezufuhr, Abgase, Zunahme von Kohlendioxid, Spurengasen sowie Ver?nderungen durch Zerst?rung der Vegetation. Es werden r?umlich begrenzte Beeintr?chtigungen der Atmosph?re hervorgerufen, die vielfach schwere Sch?den verursachen (u.a. Abw?rme, saurer Regen, Smog, Photooxidantien, Luftverschmutzung). Noch folgenreicher sind global wirksame Klima?nderungen; ob sie natrlich oder anthropogen entstanden sind, ist oft schwer nachzuweisen, so die Tatsache, dass seit rund 100 Jahren mit der Industrialisierung die globale Temperatur der Atmosph?re in Erdbodenn?he um 0,7oC zugenommen hat, am st?rksten in den letzten 10 Jahren. Die gegenw?rtige Erw?rmung ist statistisch signifikant, also nicht als mehr oder minder bliche Schwankung zu erkl?ren. Sie wird von Umweltverb?nden und kritischen Wissenschaftlern h?ufig als Beginn einer globalen Klimakatastrophe angesehen, die nicht nur zur Verschiebung der Klimazonen sondern durch einen weltweiten deutlichen Anstieg der Temperatur und einem daraus folgenden Abschmelzen der Polkappen auch zu gro?r?umigen berschwemmungen fhren soll.

AA11017928	a residuum is also called a residue.  Ashes from a fire is a good example.    Water vapor condensates around a glass of ice water or ice tea.  Condensation occurs at or below the dew point.      Condensation often forms on the ground at night ... it's called dew.  Can you guess why?   :)    Condensation will also occur above the dew point when there is wind.  A good example of this is having ice form on the wings of a plane in flight when the temperature is 4 degrees Centigrade.

Dividing each by 25.4 mm/inch will give you the decimal values in inches.    You can purchase 'numbered bits' which are very precise (to thousandths.)  [My small set of numbered bits only go as large as .226 inches.]  If you do not need precision, convert the decimal to a fraction.      You can then look up the fractional equivilent of those.

The formula is:      change the equation to:  5x  - 2y  +63  = 0        y =  mx   +  b  (where   b   is the constant = +63)       9  =  (m times 9)  +  63   then:  -54 = 9m   then:   -6 = m    negative, reciprocal of slope =  m(second line) =    [-  1/ m (first line) ]      then  m(second line) =   -1/ -6      then  m(second line)  =  1/6  =  0.1666      In other words, perpendicular slopes are negative reciprocals of each other.      Now, the equation:     y = mx + b     then y = 0.16667x + b  using x  =  -9 and  y =  -9, the value for b would be:        -9  =  0.16667(-9)  +  b        -9  =  -1.5 + b     - 7.5 =  b    write the equation in terms of  x + y =  b:    0.16667x + y  =  -7.5      Now, if you are asking which (a, b, c, or d) is the correct answer,     I used "d" and plugged in      x  =  -9;  y  =  -9; and got  -63

Those who cannot (or chose not) compete must find other ways to make money.    The State of Florida has sugar plantations which (I believe) receive federal subsidies.  Also, the fed's have tariffs on sugar  imports .  This keeps the price of sugar at an artificially-high cost to consumers.  It has also led some chocolate/candy companies to 'outsource' to other countries in order to (make and) sell chocolates/candies at a competitive price.

Orientalism     ed   Orientalism is the study of Near and Far Eastern societies and cultures, languages and peoples by Western scholars. It can also refer to the imitation or depiction of aspects of Eastern cultures in the West by writers, designers and artists.    In the former meaning, the term Orientalism has come to acquire negative connotations in some quarters and is interpreted to refer to the study of the East by Westerners shaped by the attitudes of the era of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries. When used in this sense, it implies old-fashioned and prejudiced outsider interpretations of Eastern cultures and peoples. This viewpoint was most famously articulated and propagated by Edward Said in his controversial 1978 book Orientalism, which was critical of this scholarly tradition and of modern scholars including Princeton University professor Bernard Lewis.

This is the opposite of the term Occident, which has largely dropped from common usage. Similar terms are the French-derived Levant and Anatolia, from the Greek anatole, two further locutions for the direction in which the sun rises.    In terms of The Old World, Europe was considered to be 'The West' or Occidental, and the furthest known Eastern extremity 'The East' or 'The Orient'.    From at least the time of the Roman Empire until at least the Middle Ages, what is now considered 'the Middle East' was then considered 'the Orient'. During that period, the flourishing cultures of the Far East were little known, just as Europe was essentially unknown in the Far East.    Over time, the common understanding of 'the Orient' has continually shifted East as Western explorers traveled deeper into Asia. In Biblical times, the Three Wise Men 'from the Orient' were actually Magi from "The East", (relative to Israel), probably meaning the Persian Empire or Arabia. After a period, as Europe gained knowledge of countries further to the East, the definition of the limit of 'the Orient' progressively shifted eastwards, until the Pacific Ocean was reached, in what is also known as 'the Far East'. This can cause some confusion about the historical and geographic scope of Oriental Studies.    However, there still remain some contexts where 'the Orient' or 'Oriental' refer to older definitions. For example, 'Oriental Spices' typically come from regions extending from the Middle East through the Indian sub-continent to Indo-China. Also, travel on the Orient Express (from Paris to Istanbul), is eastward bound (towards the sunrise), but does not reach what is currently understood to be the Orient.    In contemporary English, Oriental is usually a synonym for the peoples, cultures and goods from the parts of East Asia traditionally occupied by East Asians and Southeast Asians, excluding Indians, Arabs and other more westerly peoples. In some parts of America it is considered derogatory to use this term to refer to Asians (whether East, South, West or Central Asians). For example, in Washington state it is illegal to use the word 'oriental' in legislation and government documents [citation needed].      [edit] History of Orientalism  It is difficult to be precise about the origin of the distinction between the "West" and the "East", which did not appear as a polarity before the oriens/occidens divided administration of the Roman Empire under Diocletian. However the rise of both Christianity and Islam produced a sharp opposition between European Christendom and the Muslim cultures to the East and in North Africa. During the Middle Ages Islamic peoples were the "alien" enemies of the Christian world. European knowledge of cultures further to the East was very sketchy. Nevertheless, there was a vague awareness that complex civilizations existed in India and China, from which luxury goods such as woven silk textiles and ceramics were imported. As European explorations and colonisations expanded a distinction emerged between non-literate peoples, for example in Africa and the Americas, and the literate cultures of the East.    In the 18th century Enlightenment thinkers sometimes characterized aspects of Eastern cultures as superior to the Christian West. For example Voltaire promoted research into Zoroastrianism in the belief that it would su

AA11017928	Make an 'anxiety tester' -   You will need:      a sturdy cardboard box,         30 inches or  so of solid 12-to-16 ga. wire,         a 1 1/2 volt battery with holder (so you can connect wires to the battery's terminals),          either/both a flashlight bulb (that lights on 1 1/2 volts) and/or a buzzer,          a 'wand' (you can use the 12 guage wire)         and an off/on toggle switch.    You can make changes, but they must fit the voltage used.    The battery is in the box.    The light is mounted on the box and the buzzer can be inside the box.  The switch is mounted on the box.  The wire comes out of the box and makes many sharp twists and turns before going back into the box.     The 'wand' has a loop at the end (like the eye of a needle, but bigger) and the loop goes around the contorted wire.  The other end of the wand is fed into the box.    Wire the tester so that everything is in series.  When the loop on the wand touches the contorted wire, the circuit is complete and the light and/or buzzer goes off.    Those people having calm hands (i. e., are not anxious) will be able to move the loop from one end of the wire to the other without having the light/buzzer go off.

NOW:  cos of (x+y) = cos (37 + 22) = cos 59 = 0.5150              cos of (x-y)  = cos (37 - 22)  = cos 15 = 0.9659               sin of (x+y) = sin (37 + 22) = sin 59  = 0.8572             sin of (x-y)  = sin (37 -  22) = sin 15  = 0.2588  Since you told me they belong in the 3rd quadrant, their values must be negative ... rather than positive as shown! ! !       In order for them to be in the 3rd quadrant, you must add 180 degrees to them:              59 + 180 =  239 degrees              15 + 180 =  195 degrees    If this looks correct to you, follow the same steps for the other problems.    NOTE:  You did not ask for the values of the:               csc                sec               tan               cot|`|def680773285bb059a699792109b8d3daa	You have to use the Pythagorean theorem in order to find the other trig values for the given angles.  For example, if cos x = -4/5 and x is a third quadrant angle, then make a right triangle with the adj side 4, hypot. 5 and figure the opp side by the Pyth thm.  You should get 3.  (Or try to remember the 3-4-5 right triangle)  Now sin x = -3/5, tan x = 3/4, etc.    Do the same thing for y.  This time tan y = 2/5.  So opp side of y is 2, adj side is 5 and hypot is sqrt (29).  This will give you sin y = -2/sqrt (29) and cos y = -5/sqrt (29).  The minus signs are because the angle is in the third quadrant.    Now, cos (x + y) = cos x * cos y - sin x * sin y  = (-4/5)(-5/sqrt (29)) - (-3/5)(-2/sqrt (29) = (20 - 6)/sqrt (29) = 14/(5*sqrt (29)) = 14*sqrt (29)/145    I will let you do the others.  This will take some time, so don't expect to get all your problems done in a short period of time.  Good luck.  Hope this has helped.
AA11017928	1.  Ask the school where tutoring is done outside of school, and contact them.    2.  Public library    3.  Advertise (with parent's permission) on bulletin boards at restaurants, library, etc.   BE  SURE  TO  TUTOR  IN PUBLIC PLACES (E. G.,  LIBRARY) OR WITH ONE OF YOUR PARENTS OR 18+ SIBLING!     BE   SAFE.    4.  Notify the Girl Scout leader to pass your desire to members' parents.    5.  Get tutorial papers from edhelper.com.  You have to join to get a lot of stuff.   I copy/paste the practice sheets into WORD and save them for future use.  I photocopy the originals for the students to use ... to save continued printing.    p. s.    You MUST be able to diagnose the student's deficiencies.   I give them a verbal test in the subject area.  This  tells me not only whether or not he/she knows the subject, but also how well he/she can think.  I do not use multiply-guess questions.  I use open-ended questions like, "Tell me about the Civil War from the events leading  up to it as well as the aftermath."    Go for it!
AA11017928	1.  Ask your teacher, counselor AND librarian for help.    2.  Read several text books on the subject.    3.

AA11017928	Where are you in your education at the present time?  If you are a teenager/gcse student, take Latin.  Join a debate team/club.  Laywers must be able to read (and comprehend) lots of material in a short timeframe.  Lawyers must have an excellent command of the English language, as well as an analytical mind.  Lawyers must love to write as well as do 'research' of previous cases and case law.    Do you want to study International (criminal) law, or just one in a particular country?   Do you think you might like to be a judge within the criminal court system?    Contact several schools of law and ask what prerequisites are needed to gain entry.  Ask for suggestions in what electives would help, as well as what extra-curricular activities would be beneficial.    Contact several lawyers and/or law firms... as well as judges of criminal courts.  See if someone will mentor you, and possibly hire you to work with them while you are in school.    Just remember, innocent until proven guilty in a court of law!    Criminal lawyers are usually required to devote some of their valuable time to pro bono cases.

a68301db1749d71894ea5022bfa7573daa	Unfortunately, I did stats many years ago during my A-Levels and have forgotten most of the notation including the meaning of Sx.    I can with complete certainty tell you that as a sample size increases, the sample distribution will get closer and closer to a Normal Distribution curve. The proof for this is the Central Limit Theorem. There is a solid proof for this theorem but I can't actually remember it.    If Sx is the standard deviation, then the sample Standard Deviation (x-bar) can be used to estimate the population standard deviation (mew U) by multiplying it by 100/99 (one hundred divided by ninety-nine).    I hope this helps!

AA11017928	It's nice for you to want to do this.   However, before they will appreciate an arts center, their basic human needs (food, shelter, clothing, health) must be met.  If those needs are not met, they will not appreciate having an arts center.  (Do they already have one?)    How will having an art center benefit them?  Art lessons?  Schooling in art careers?      Visit:   www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/ge...    Do you any of speak, read, write either of their official languages?   Have you been there to know where you will place the building(s)?  Who will run the art center?    That said:  The project must be coordinated and supported by lots of people and organizations.  While the idea is good, donors want to see the results prior to donating.    1.  Get outside support behind the project.  Get international art associations, art museums, art colleges, and well-known artists to buy into this.    2.  Set up a web page for donations.  The 'organization' receiving the monies must be a 'charity' ... one governments will allow donors to deduct donations off of their taxes.  In the USA, it must be a 501(c)(3) organization.  This means it must be incorporated and meet special conditions for being a 'charity.'    3.  Have an architect draw the plans and build a scale model.    4.  Have the location 'earmarked' for the building(s) and make sure all permits, licenses, etc. have been (or can be) obtained.  Will the municipality grant it a property-tax-free status?    5.  Get Oprah Winfrey (a daytime TV hostess in the USA) to support this cause.  She has supported projects to help those in Africa in the past, and just opened "The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy For Girls" in Henly-on-klip, South Africa.    6.  There are professional fund-raising companies.  Hire one of them, and you remain an artist.    7.  The monies collected must be escrowed.  You probably need a CPA (certified public accountant) that is licensed in France and in Kenya.    Go for it!

807896964b6a149310aa786e3a57e292aa	O tempo de aprendizado depende nao somente do modulo em si, mas do esforco de cada um em aprender.   Bom, se voce tem duas aulas semanais, isso ja eh muito importante no avanco linguistico. O melhor a fazer eh, alem dessas duas aulas semanais, voce praticar em casa ou na escola ou no trabalho ou em qualquer outro lugar: ouvir, ler, escrever e falar.  Com o avanco tecnologico da internet, eh possivel voce encontrar aulas e testes online que lhe ajudarao a lapidar seu ingles.   Se voce se encontra em um nivel basico, procure melhorar seu vocabulario.  Intermediario, procure formar as frases em estruturas corretas como ex: I was watching a great movie last night.    ao inves de: I was watched a good movie last day.  No avancado, procure expressar verbalmente, uma conversacao descontraida com alguem que ja esta neste nivel. Ouvir e assitir a programas em ingles ajuda muito.

AA11352641	Justice is when the punishment is suited to the actual consequences of an action.     it's a myth.     Here's some injustice on a small scale.....I served on the jury for a man convicted of possessing crack cocaine with the intent to sell it. It was found in the floorboard of his car, right at his feet, and he admitted that he was the only one driving the car that day. He was caught because he was smoking a joint in the parking lot of a wal-mart and the police saw him - they had followed him out of a drug-infested neighborhood. We as a jury received no direction on what the law is regarding possession and some of us disagreed on what we heard in the testimony, but we were not allowed to read the transcripts. His defense was "I don't know how it got there". He got off. He's gonna go sell drugs back on the streets so people like me can't feel safe walking their dogs after dark.  Ironically, I got a parking ticket because we debated so long my car was parked there longer than allowed and I couldn't leave in the middle of testimony to go move it. I couldn't get out of the ticket! I couldn't get them to let me out of a parking ticket I got parked in front of the courthouse til 8 pm for jury duty and this guy got off with a bunch of crack in his car with his defense being a shrug. Un-freaking-believeable!!!!|`|9ea47a936d91ef386edcca904bda1d43aa	in Britain, justice no longer exists. Criminals laugh in our faces, and the police and judicinal system lets them do it.     The way I see it, Justice (my way) would be militant justice. Imagine a peadophile has been caught with a child, I would pass sentence on him by saying he must be castrated and if caught doing that disgusting act again, should be beaten within an inch of his life!|`|5c7c77195c5538ac5f796bf67c3eb28daa	Justice is a concept involving the fair, moral, and impartial treatment of all persons, especially in law. It is often seen as the continued effort to do what is "right." In most of all cases what one regards as "right" is determined by consulting the majority, employing logic, or referring to divine authority, in the case of religion. If a person lives under a certain set law in a certain country, justice is considered making the person follow the law and be punished if not.|`|9249c05c0891c00e16353a0fc5c21663aa	Primary Law and prime virtue, is the quality of being morally just or righteous, the principle of just dealing, just conduct, integrity, rectitude. One of the four cardinal virtues, justice is observance of the Divine Law, the state of being righteous or just before God; conformity of an action or thing to moral right, or to reason, truth, or fact, fairness, correctness, propriety. You must be justice tempered with mercy, for Mercy tempered with Justice is too soft.

Trouxe aqui um exemplo de um grande vencedor que com certeza servir de inspira??o  voc:    O Presidente que n?o desistiu   O senso do dever de continuar est presente em todos ns. A obriga??o de lutar  obriga??o de todos ns. Eu senti o apelo desta obriga??o. (Abraham Lincoln)  Provavelmente, o maior exemplo de persistncia  o de Abraham Lincoln. Se voc quiser aprender sobre algum que n?o desistiu, n?o procure mais.   Nascido na misria, Lincoln defrontou-se com a derrota, ao longo de toda a sua vida. Perdeu oito elei??es, fracassou duas vezes nos negcios e teve um colapso nervoso. Poderia ter desistido muitas vezes, mas n?o desistiu e, por n?o ter desistido, tornou-se um dos maiores presidentes na histria dos Estados Unidos.   Lincoln era um vencedor e jamais se entregou. Aqui est um resumo do caminho percorrido por ele at a Casa Branca:   1816  Sua famlia foi for?ada a sair de sua casa. Ele teve que trabalhar para sustent-la. 1818  Sua m?e morreu.   1831  Fracassou nos negcios.   1832  Concorreu a deputado estadual e perdeu. Perdeu, tambm, o emprego. Quis entrar na escola de Direito, mas n?o conseguiu ser admitido.   1833  Tomou dinheiro emprestado a um amigo para come?ar um negcio e um ano depois estava falido. Passou os dezessete anos seguintes de sua vida pagando essa dvida.   1834  Candidatou-se, novamente, a deputado estadual e ganhou.   1835  Estava noivo, sua noiva morreu e ele ficou desolado.   1836  Teve um colapso nervoso e ficou de cama durante seis meses.   1838  Indicado para porta-voz da Camara Estadual, foi derrotado.   1840  Indicado para o Colgio Eleitoral, foi derrotado.   1843  Candidato ao Congresso, perdeu.   1846  Candidato ao Congresso, novamente: dessa vez, ganhou. Foi a Washington e fez um bom trabalho.   1848  Candidato  reelei??o para o Congresso, foi derrotado.   1849  Indicado para o Cartrio de Registro de Imveis em seu Estado, foi rejeitado.   1854  Candidato ao Senado dos Estados Unidos, perdeu.   1856  Solicita a indica??o para Vice-Presidncia na conven??o nacional do seu partido: obteve menos de cem votos.   1858  Candidato ao Senado dos Estados Unidos, novamente perdeu.   1860  Eleito Presidente dos Estados Unidos. O caminho foi difcil e escorregadio. Um de meus ps escorregou, empurrando o outro para fora da estrada, mas eu me levantei e disse para mim mesmo:  apenas um deslize e n?o uma queda.

AA11017928	Spying on one's own citizens is a power play about instilling fear and controlling behavior.   It is also about satisfying the person's ego by obtaining as much power as possible.    Look into Hitler's Gestapo, and Saddam Hussein's and Lenin's  equivalents.

Beyond that, frankly, I'd point them to St. Ignatious College Prep - there is not better choice in the city or surrounding area for that matter.

The answer is simple - two negatives cancel each other out.|`|2P88fTz2aa	I think I know where you are going with this. Here is a "translation":    a. b. c. ARE basic engineering.  1. 2. 3.
