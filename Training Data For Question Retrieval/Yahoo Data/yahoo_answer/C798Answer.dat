Almost everything we eat here is from some other culture. Hamburgers are my first thought. I also know that Chow mien and fortune cookies originated in the US.

He didn't have enough of one thing to make a serving so he put all the leftovers in the kitchen together and served it with rice. The customers loved it and Chow Mien was born. <br>  Jello!

U02wg7graa	Wood is definitely the best, and is certainly not unhygenic. It is more hygenic than plastic, which gets scratches in which bacteria might lodge. Wood is naturally antibacterial. Anyway, back to the question, I find that silicone items are fantastic as they are endlessly versatile, and never, ever melt.

Savory seasonings are generally used in meat dishes, or to flavor vegetables and starches. (Herbed butter, saffron rice, etc.)<br>  <br>  Spices are usually associated with the sweet things in life. We think of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and all those wonderful things we put in desserts.<br>  <br>  Although herbs and spices can be used for both, generally we don't put onions and garlic in cake and ice cream and we usually don't put cinnamon on fish.<br>  <br>  So there are technical answers and aesthetic answers.

And Purina is basically McDonald's for animals. Feed them Evo or another high protein, low grain food. Purina, Iams, Eukuanuba, etc. contain much higher levels of corn, wheat, rice, and other grains than is healthy for a cat or dog.

We are omnivores, which means we can choose to eat more or less meat or veggetables. But cats are not, they are carnivores plain and simple.

I'd like to recommend a tool on kraftfoods.com that can help you come up with some new ideas for dinner that don't require a trip to the grocery store.<br>  <br>  The "Make it Now" tool lets you enter 3 ingredients, then you get suggested recipes that all have those ingredients. That way, your dinner recommendations make sense with what you have on hand or what you're craving. You'll find the tool in the upper left hand side of this page:<a href="http://www.kraftfoods.com/kf/Dinner/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kraftfoods.com/kf/Dinner/</a><br>  <br>  For example, if you enter "chicken and rice" you'll get 125 ideas using these 2 ingredients.  If you’re feeling like Mexican-inspired food, a favorite recipe of mine with chicken that is super easy is Chicken Nacho Bake.   Top chicken breasts with salsa, sour cream and broken tortilla chips.  Bake, then top with cheese.

If you have any fresh beets you can simmer them in milk and use the milk in the recipe.

No. The only excpetion is pineapple upside down cake has milk.|`|v4f1oqOCaa	you can use beet juice believe it or not. or red cabbage.  you have to boil it to turn the liquid red and then measure out a small amount.<br>  <br>  saw it on food network :)|`|OakU4oACaa	I'm not a baker or anything, but maybe instead of using red dye you could use like red sugar.

You need to have a 90's rave party!! Techno and dancing in the park - and the preferred drink at a rave was water, so that meets the requirement of no alcohol. For snacks get loads of m&m's and tic tac's.<br>  Food? Well .. in the 90's it was all "back to originals", unprocessed stuff. Raw, veggie and smoothies - and big plates with very little on them. You could do an Italian buffet - Italian food is very basic and rustique, as opposed to French food, which is usually refined through different preparation methods ..
fVuuIyu2aa	Probably not. I didn't know they took the caffeine out, if they did, then it's now just a weird tasting beer. My husband would always drink it with the excuse that it's "his coffee" but now it's pointless.

Don't forget to match wine (s) to the meal (remember to taste test these as well!). TIP - be conscious of choosing dishes that won't keep you in the kitchen all night or that a very quick to prepare when your guests are at the table.   <br>    Consider the décor you will be using. If your budget allows, shop for a new dinner party set that matches your theme. OR search through linen and crockery you already have to determine how you will dress the table to suit your theme. Small inexpensive additions such as a new tablecloth or placemats can really change the look of a dinner setting and can enhance your theme.   <br>    Create a shopping list.   <br>  1 week prior <br>  Purchase items off the shopping list for food that can be pre-prepared, beverages for the night and other items that can be stored until the day of the dinner.   <br>    Pre-prepare foods that can be frozen until the dinner party.   <br>    Prepare your party clothes - choose what you will be wearing on the night. You probably won't have time to be fussy on the day if you are cooking and baking.   <br>   Organize Music for the party - background music will enhance your theme.   <br>    Follow up with guests who are yet to RSVP.    <br>    Finalise numbers and make reservations at the restaurant or café if you’re a having the dinner party outside of your home.   <br>  Day before<br>   Go shopping for fresh food items and ingredients to recipes that a required for cooking on the day/night of the dinner party.   <br>    Clean house and dinner party area (don't forget the bathroom!)   <br>      Prepare your clothes for the day - wash iron etc.   <br>  Day of the Dinner Party<br>   Buy fresh flowers (if being used for the table centre-piece.   <br>    Set table with linen, crockery, cutlery and glassware.   <br>    Set up stereo in a location where the dinner party table will be able to hear the music.   <br>   Quick check to make sure the house is clean.  <br>    Start cooking meals in the afternoon that can be reheated later and still taste excellent - remember you want to spend as much time with your guests, not in the kitchen.    <br>    Give yourself an hour to get ready and relax with a glass of wine before your guests arrive.   <br>   Enjoy your wonderful cooking and great company!  <br>    Clean up once all guests have left - try not to let your guests help you will the cleaning, even though they may insist on helping.

jZRtTpZiaa	There are several garbage websites that came out strongly against soy.  Mercola is one of them.  I would caution against believing any of the junk on any of those websites (which also say some other crazy things unrelated to soy)  -- and I'd caution against believing some of the extreme pro-soy websites too.  Any site that is one-sided and doesn't mention the potential pros and cons is completely biased, and doesn't deserve any attention.  There is no estrogen in soy.  There are phytoestrogens, which are not the same.  Phytoestrogens are in other foods too.    There are animal estrogens in cow's milk and meat, which often goes unmentioned, and is potentially much more harmful.  Here's what Dr. Andrew Weil had to say about soy <a href="http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/QAA326575" rel="nofollow">http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/QAA326575</a><br>  <br>  I eat soy products like tofu and edamame.  I drink soy milk.  I have done so for many years without any problems whatsoever.  I know many people who have used soy for decades, with not a single person ever had the problems with soy that are mentioned on any of those extreme anti-soy websites.  You need to question the motives behind some of them like weston-price group which is funded by farmers, and is also very anti-vegetarian.  Dr Mercola is one of the nutjobs who is part of that group.   They wrote a letter to the President of the United States screaming that feeding soy to prison inmates was the equivalent of torture and medical experimentation.   They promote cod liver and raw unpasteurized milk.  They're nuts.<br>  <br>  My doctor, who specialized in nutrition and has taught nutrition at the university level says soy's okay, and eats soy himself.  That's good enough for me.  <br>  <br>  Also Dr. Andrew Weil, a popular doctor in the US,  who often speaks on integrative medicine, has testified before Congress,  and writes books on health, graduated from Harvard University  and studied botany among his other education, says soy's great.  That adds even more thumbs up.  <br>  <br>  I like it.  I'm eating it.<br>  If there's anything that's bad for you, it's the highly processed stuff.  It's probably not a great idea to eat too much of anything.  "Everything in moderation" is the way to go.  Don't eat 20 pounds of soy a day!|`|yOK32PM9aa	There are probably going to be lots of answers with Googled pseudo-science on this one, but I have eaten them in quantities for many years, and suffered no ill effects.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No!|`|llkSmgLJaa	Soy beans are good for you, don't believe the meat and dairy industry propaganda. The Chinese have been eating themf for thousands of years with no problems.|`|xfUNgn2Yaa	u can't tell 100%, personally I love them 2, plus they say they contain estrogen..( hormone that makes u fertile, as in egg production..:p..)|`|wp2LaPxdaa	not at all!|`|alDXc0tWaa	Unless soy is fermented it actually isn't very healthy and could be bad for you. Non-fermented soy products contain phytic acid, which contains anti-nutritive properties. Phytic acid binds with certain nutrients, including iron, to inhibit their absorption. <br>  <br>  And from this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.mercola.com/article/soy/avoid_soy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/article/soy/avoid...</a> <br>  comes:<br>  " The Chinese did not eat unfermented soybeans as they did other legumes such as lentils because the soybean contains large quantities of natural toxins or "antinutrients". First among them are potent enzyme inhibitors that block the action of trypsin and other enzymes needed for protein digestion.<br>  <br>  These inhibitors are large, tightly folded proteins that are not completely deactivated during ordinary cooking. They can produce serious gastric distress, reduced protein digestion and chronic deficiencies in amino acid uptake. In test animals, diets high in trypsin inhibitors cause enlargement and pathological conditions of the pancreas, including cancer.14<br>  <br>  Soybeans also contain haemagglutinin, a clot-promoting substance that causes red blood cells to clump together.<br>  <br>  Trypsin inhibitors and haemagglutinin are growth inhibitors. Weanling rats fed soy containing these antinutrients fail to grow normally. Growth-depressant compounds are deactivated during the process of fermentation, so once the Chinese discovered how to ferment the soybean, they began to incorporate soy foods into their diets.<br>  <br>  In precipitated products, enzyme inhibitors concentrate in the soaking liquid rather than in the curd. Thus, in tofu and bean curd, growth depressants are reduced in quantity but not completely eliminated."|`|sYaD9zcEaa	I luv them 2 but idk if they can b bad 4 u if u eat 2many

jZRtTpZiaa	Vegetarians do not eat turkey on Fridays,  or Mondays, Tuesdays Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, or Sundays.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	ask your priest, but i'm sure he would say no|`|hUYaaXBvaa	the first person is right, only fish<br>  and on ash wednesday and some other day i can't remember|`|HkMhWvtgaa	If your local bishop has declared Lenten Fridays as "days of abstinence", then you must abstain from all meat, including poultry.  Fish, eggs, and dairy products, however, are acceptable.  <br>  <br>  Only Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are worldwide days of abstinence.  They are also days of fast (up to one regular-size meal with up to two half-meals, with no snacks in between).<br>  <br>  By the way, there are exceptions for children, the elderly, people who are taking care of young children, and anyone with a health-related dietary requirement that prevents them from observing the fast or abstinence.  (There was one year when, due to severe anemia, I was under doctor's orders to eat red meat every day.  It does happen!)<br>  <br>  EDIT TO ADD:<br>  ombo, I do not see how you are "insulted" by the fact that some people, unlike yourself, do eat meat, or by the existence of religions that practice a temporary form of vegetarianism (that is, on Fridays), or by the fact that people sometimes don't find the correct forum to ask a question.  It's not always an easy system to navigate, so let's be tolerant of occasional posts that are in the "wrong" place.<br>  <br>  For that matter, why aren't discussions of the philosophy of veganism (as opposed to recipes for dishes a vegan can eat) also in the Religion and Spirituality forum?  Because this is the one people found first.  Should people who just came to find recipes for meatless dishes be "insulted" by the more philosophical content?<br>   <br>  By the way, you should know "vegetarian" is not the same as "vegan", and some vegetarians do in fact eat fish.|`|e2926326f61b2becbde04426fcb444c8aa	Some define meat as the flesh of mammals that live on land.

LEvJLcsFaa	nuestro cuerpo se compone de un 70% de agua. hayque intentar que esa agua este siempre lo mas limpia posible. Por eso se dice que hay que beber mucha agua. El agua que nos sobra se elimina siempre y cuando al cuerpo le queden recursos. Hace poco vi un poster en el ba?o de un hospital que ense?aba distintos colores de la orina y segun el color de la orina podemos saber nuestro grado de hidratacion. Cuanto mas clara la orina mas hidratados estamos. De hecho cuando tengamos una infeccion de orina esta suele ser mas oscura que lo normal.<br>  Bebe mucho|`|24ef3a7229807082e842dff6826612e4aa	Yo diría que no, ya que la orina no es de la única forma que eliminamos el agua que bebemos, también por sudor.

Por lo tanto no se trata de excretar toda el agua que consumes por que el 60% del cuerpo se compone de agua, se necesita agua para tus celulas, agua para la sangre, agua para liquido cefalorraquideo en el cerebro, etc. lo importante es que hay que consumir mas agua de lo que excretamos diariamente para no desidratar los tejidos.|`|YLnCMP38aa	no, se queda en tu cuerpo por algun tiempo y no solo la orinas sino tambien la deshecahas cuando sudas y eso!!!<br>  <br>  ciao|`|aHSHI1kXaa	no, nuestro cuerpo absorbe una parte y la otra se va por la orina|`|nor389diaa	claro que no|`|vOG4JSviaa	no es lo mismo solo se filtra lo que tomamos y por el sudor seria por la orina 75% y por sudor un 25%|`|wLHohXcHaa	Definitivamente NO.

The key is to “dock” the pie crust by lightly pricking it all over with a fork, then placing a parchment paper in the center and filling with pie weights such as metal pellets, dry beans or uncooked rice.]<br>  <br>  Make the vanilla crème patissière:<br>  Whisk the eggs yolks and the sugar in a heatproof bowl placed over a pan of barely simmering water. Whisk constantly until the mixture has thickened, about 8-10 minutes. In a separate pan, heat the heavy cream and the split vanilla bean and vanilla seeds. Bring to a boil, then whisk into the egg and sugar mixture, stirring constantly to thicken, 5-8 minutes more.<br>  <br>  Remove the custard from the heat and remove the vanilla bean. Let cool completely, then pour into the tart shell, and chill in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours to set.<br>  <br>  [Chef’s Note: Wipe the vanilla bean dry with a paper towel and reserve it for use in another recipe. You can place it in a jar of sugar to give the sugar a nice aroma.]

If you're not such a fruit-eater and want to have more from the good stuff, the best way to start eating fruit is to squeeze fruit juices. In this way you can get used to fruit and after drinking juices for a while you'll see that your appetite to have raw fruits will increase. <br>  <br>  Aren't many fibers lost if you squeeze fruit? <br>  Squeezed fruit is as healthy as eating a piece of raw fruit out of your hand. Unlike many people think there is not a whole lot of fruit flesh lost when you squeeze fruit. This means that your glass of orange juice does contain all the fibers you need! <br>  These fibers prevent from many diseases. Fibers stimulate the digestive system so if you have a substantial amount of fruit intake it is not necessary to eat bran or other intestine stimulating foods. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Create at least one fresh vitamin dosis a day, it will also cheer you up!<br>  Citrus press & fruit blender <br>  If you are in the possession of a fruit press you can squeeze the citrus fruits. Real fruit lovers also have a blender so they can make mixes of all types of fruit. A juice-centrifuge easily extracts the juice out of all fruits and many vegetables and is in our opinion for the more extreme squeezers who also want to drink vegetable juices. It is not very practical in use (a lot of cleaning) and for squeezing almost any type of fruit a fruit press and a blender will do.<br>  <br>  Can, glass bottle and carton <br>  Try to get it into your system: squeeze those wonder-fruits yourself everyday. Freshly squeezed juices are best. Magical characteristics are ascribed to freshly squeezed juice. Avoid to drink fruit juice from a can or glass bottle because when the bottle or can is closed the juice is heated and gets an acid structure. Juice from cartons, cans and glass bottles has been pasteurized. This means the juice has been heated (cooked) to kill all the germs. The heating of food changes the enzymes of the food so it looses (some of) its nutritious value. This means you can't substitute freshly squeezed juice by juice from cartons. <br>  <br>  There is a huge variety of fruits. <br>  Just wait until you get started with mangos, strawberries, peaches, apricots, limes and melons! There are thousands of combinations possible! <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  It's gonna be a fruit party everyday!! <br>    <br>   Tips <br>  - Squeeze at least one fruit drink a day. In this way you eat about 3 to 4 fruits so you can fulfill your daily need; <br>  - Put some ice cubes in the blender with your juice. This cools your fruit drink quickly in summer; <br>  - Put a little bit of banana in your juice mix and blend it like a milk-shake. This gives your fruit drink a certain softness and reduces the bitterness (caused by grapefruits for example); <br>  - Take sweet fruits to blend. Use citrus fruits (oranges, red-grapefruits) as a basis and mix it in the blender with the sweet fruits of your choice. You can squeeze a jar of orange juice that you keep in the fridge and blend it with the fruit of your choice when you want to. <br>

Most people use way too high a power setting. I experimented. I use plastic egg cups which are tapered on the sides, sort of like a cupcake pan. I crack an egg into each depression. I use a fork to poke holes in the yolk, only one is needed. Set the timer for 10 minutes on 1/3rd power for 2 X-large eggs and see what happens. You may have to adjust time and power to get the results you desire. Do NOT try to cook eggs in the shell unless you are feeling especially brave. You CAN do it if you find the end with the air bubble, support the egg so the bubble end is UP, and poke a needle or a skewer into the egg far enough to pierce the bubble and yolk, and again, use lower power and longer time. The risk you face in the shell is the egg can literally explode, and coat the whole insides with egg and shell pieces.|`|NScT0y1caa	ive tried that once before, and it didnt work out well. all of the proteins in the egg comes out while the egg is cookin, and it becomes all rubbery and yucky.

Some similarly coloured foods - such as pizza topics and ketchup - are so coloured because they both contain tomatoes, not because there is any intrinsic link between taste and colours.

I think what you are thinking of is that you associate a certain color with a certain taste and beleive you can taste color. <br>  Although there is also a certain disorder (not exactly a disorder) where your senses work differently and can sense different things.

But if you asked someone who didn't care about what color they were tasting, it would most likley not work. |`|HP7iKcAwaa	Only those born with it can.

W4sV5Qhfaa	The best time to make fondant is on a dry day meaning no humidity in the air or a humidity level below 30. Also make sure that you don't have the oven on or run the dishwasher,washer machine or dryer. All of these add humidity to the air in your home. Sometimes the heat from your hands (if you are rolling it with your hands) will make it sticky.<br>  Keep adding more PS until it's not sticky or try making the fondant on another day. |`|d66d0a934615db177ebd020d00b8dff6aa	MM Fondant should feel much like pie dough.  It will depend on how much humidity is in the air, but you can also add too much PS to it and it will be dry and will crack instead of being smooth.  I always start out with 1/4 of a cup LESS than the recipe calls for..and add a little at a time until it stops being sticky.  You may need to let it rest (covered up and at room temp) for 30 minutes or so because the heat from your hands will affect it too.  Try rubbing your hands with a little crisco or butter or spray with pam, and then knead the fondant.  This really helps keep it off your hands and helps keep the fondant from not being too dry and cracking.

yfMZpfydaa	Polysaccharides, especially pectins. <br>  <br>  Sugars - glucose and fructose. The drier the wine, the less sugars. Most red wines are completely dry (less than 0.1% reducing sugars - mostly nonfermentable sugars like pentoses). <br>  <br>  Acids: <br>  <br>  Tartaric, citric, malic, lactic (malic and lactic are often in inverse proportions, due to malo-lactic fermentation) sulfuric and acetic. Too much of any of these (especially sulfuric or acetic acids) will ruin the wine. Maximum legal permitted volatile acidity on the average is about 0.120 grams per 100 mL of wine. Few wines reach anywhere near this high. <br>  <br>  Alcohols: <br>  <br>  Chiefly ethanol. <br>  <br>  Methanol is found in trace quantities in grapes and is mostly found in fruit (not grape) wines due to pectinase activity. <br>  <br>  Sorbitol and Mannitol are rare in grape wines. <br>  <br>  Alcohol level is listed on the wine label. <br>  <br>  Carbonyl Compounds: <br>  <br>  Wine is full of aldehydes and ketones. Acetaldehyde and diacetyl are the most common. <br>  <br>  Esters: <br>  <br>  Chiefly Ethyl Acetate at levels of 40 mg/L average. <br>  <br>  Also a trace amount of a wide variety of Esters are responsible for the aroma of wine. <br>  <br>  Nitrogen Compounds: <br>  <br>  Nitrogen, amino acids (chiefly proline) and ammonia, in tiny quantities (60 mg/L). <br>  <br>  Phenolic Compounds: <br>  <br>  Responsible for much of the flavor and body of wine, these are a major component of wine. <br>  <br>  Benzaldehyde (vanillin) and Benzoic acid (Vanillic and Gallic acids) are the phenolic compounds one tastes the most in wines. <br>  <br>  Catechins may make up the largest quantity of Phenols. <br>  <br>  Anthocyanins are responsible for the pigmentation of red wine, and are present in proportion to the color of the wine. <br>  <br>  Resveratrol (attributed with reducing cholesterol) is a phenolic compound. <br>  <br>  Ash: <br>  <br>  On the average about 2.5 g/L of ash are found in wine. <br>  <br>  Ash being defined as the inorganic matter that remains after evaporation and incineration. <br>  <br>  Cations - most of the ash falls into this class and includes potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, lead, arsenic, etc. <br>  <br>  Trace minerals include pretty much anything that can be found in the soil, e.g. Aluminum, Barium, Cadminium, etc.. <br>  <br>  Chemical Additives <br>  <br>  SO2 is the most commonly considered additive. The legal limit for maximum SO2 in the US is 350 mg/L - it is lower in most other countries. It is the Free SO2 that a tiny percent of the population is bothered by. While the US does not set limits for Free vs. Total SO2, some other countries do, and since US and other wines are imported to those countries, the practical limit for Free SO2 is 3 mg/L (the lowest limit). Levels of SO2 above .5 mg/L are noticeable in the smell of wine to most people, and is considered undesirable. <br>  <br>  |`|kAfZaLwraa	It's made of grapes. The color difference has to do with the amount of time the skins are left in during the fermentation process.|`|Hjwp1yGWaa	Grapes, Tokay I think is one of them, and Cabernet Sauvingnon is another, Merlot is another, and Shiraz I believe.|`|zQiORLtxaa	Red Wine is made almost exclusively from black grapes, the colour coming from the skins.<br>  <br>  Firstly, the picked bunches of grapes are put through a crusher, which carefully breaks the skins. Depending on the type of wine being made, and the amount of tannin required, the stalks may or may not be discarded at this stage.<br>  <br>  Then the grapes are moved from the crusher into a fermentation vats with skins. Fermentation can take upto 4 weeks or longer to complete. The higher the temperature, the more colour and tannin is extracted.<br>  <br>  To produce soft red wines, whole grapes are fermented in sealed vats. Carbon dioxide trapped in the vat forces the grapes to ferment faster under pressure and this process can take as little a 5 days.<br>  <br>  A wine's colour and tannin content is dictated partly by the length of time the fermenting must remains in contact with the skins and pips. Unless these are restrained by a mesh, they will be carried to the surface and form a cap. If there is no mesh to hold the skins and pips down, then the vat is flushed so the cap is broken up and the colour leeched out.<br>  <br>  The weight of the mass of grapes is sufficient to squeeze the fermented juice out of grapes, and then this is allowed tio run into casks as free-run wine.<br>  <br>  The rest of the bulk goes into a press and is crushed to produce a highly tannic wine. This may be added to the free-run wine to add structure to the blend. <br>  The wine from both vat and press are mixed and transferred to tanks or barrels where a second fermentation will occur.<br>  <br>  'Fine wine' almost always spends at least a year in barrels, large or small. The wine is fined with egg-white, which drags suspended yeast and other solids in the wine downwards before being racked, filtered, and bottled.<br>  <br>  Finally, time spent in the bottle is important, but not every wine needs it. A complex (and expensive) bottle of red wine will almost certainly benefit from bottle ageing, as will white wine with both body and high enough acidity. Simple wines, intended for prompt drinking, will lose colour and freshness if left for too long.<br>  <br>  |`|2d7f2c7e52fef7aa0c605327ec47e40aaa	the poorest kind of black grapes makes the best red wine<br>  |`|uwTKVjT9aa	i'm sure its still grapes, maybe just fermented differently.|`|bZFM7AXIaa	You ask a very straightforward question, but some of the answerer's seem confused.  So, here's my 2 cents.<br>  <br>  Red wine is made from grapes from red to black skin.  There some 120+ grape varieties and clones that have red to black skin.<br>  <br>  The juice of all grapes regardless of skin color is clear (ranging from actually clear to straw like).  The color of the wine is determined by the length of time the grape juice (or must) is fermented with the red to black skin.  The longer the time, the darker the wine.<br>  <br>  A wine that is fermented with the skin for a few days might produce a rose, or popular in the US, a white zinfandel, white merlot, white grenache, white (fill in name of red grape), etc.<br>  <br>  A wine that is fermented with the skin for 4 or 5 weeks will produce a deep, dark red wine.<br>  <br>  I hope this very short course helps.<br>  <br>  As to red wine's health benefits, the jury's still out, although many have pointed to antioxidant called resveratol in the skin of red grapes as being beneficial.  Resveratol lowers bad cholesterol and helps prevent blood clots.

AA10927032	Sift your powdered sugar, it will cut down on stirring and stirring to get rid of the lumps. <br>  Plan on beating the frosting well. <br>  Make sure your cake is room temp, or just out of the refrig before you start. <br>  Use a crumb coat of icing. Just spread a light layer of icing/frosting on the cake to catch all the crumbs, then slather the rest on. <br>  A friend told me what she does if the frosting does not look perfect. She said "that is why we have sprinkles". OK, got that. <br>  Then do what Sonya said, take the back of a spoon or a wide knife and swirl and peak the frosting, just experiment a bit, and you will get the hang of it. Frosting is forgiving, and there is time for a do over before it dries. I use a pull and scoop motion, it make a swirl with a peak, and I just space them out evenly over the cake. <br>  Professionals buy a cake plate that turns, and that is great, the icing/frosting does go on smooth. <br>  If the Ace of Cakes is on food network tonight, just watching  one episode will give you lots of ideas and info. <br>  Good luck, and HB to your daughter, they are so cute at that age, I have seen endless pictures with frosting smeared on the kid from top to bottom, all of them adorable. and the guy who said kids look good in chocolate frosting is right, it really shows up in the pictures.|`|qtCVLDFxaa	The trick ? DON'T try to make it smooth ! In bakeries, they have special instruments we don't have at home. Put it on thick enough that you can't see the cake, including the sides. Then swirl your knife (or the back of a spoon works well to apply it too) so the icing is textured in swirls. Experiment with big or small etc. It looks really good and is real easy. Also, sprinkles, sprinkles, sprinkles ! Multi-color sprinkles or candy like smarties always hit it off with kids. !<br>  <br>  EDIT *** I just re-read the question that it was for a first birthday. In that case, chocolate is definately the way to go. She will look real funny with chocolate everywhere, hope you have a good bib ! And don't put any candy on her piece for the choking hazard !|`|lODnYjuMaa	pink if she is little <br>  <br>  purple if she is in middle school<br>   <br>  red if in high|`|427As7NGaa	what kind of icing are you using? make sure it is not too watery...|`|d1Q8Cg2Oaa	professional cake decorators use a turn table and icing scrapers to give a cake a smooth finish.A plastic turn table can be bought for about $ 10.00 at wal-mart or a craft store.Icing scrapers are a bit harder to find.If you cannot locate one,you can make a temporary scraper from an old cereal box,parchment paper(sold with the foil and plastic wrap in grocery stores),and scotch tape.Cut the card board 4''x6''.fold in half,making it 4''x3''.Tape all sides together,stapling the center if possible.Now tightly wrap with parchment.You may need to staple the parchment because tape will not always stick to parchment.Now you are ready to ice your cake.Make sure you chill your cake so it will be firm and not tear apart easily.Starting on the top of your cake,pile your icing in the center.Spread your icing in a back &forth motion as you turn your cake on your turn table.NEVER lift your spatula while icing your cake.always slide it away from the cake.After you have put a thick layer of icing on top,making sure the icing extends over the edges,start applying thick icing to the sides.If it is a tall cake,start at the top then apply your next dollop of icing directly below that,connecting top and side icing together.Repeat this procedure all the way around the cake.Now take your icing scraper and gently start scraping away thin layers of icing from the sides,pulling toward you ,holding the scraper at an angel.If it is a round cake,slowly turn the cake while you work.Keep repeating this until your sides are smooth,scraping the icing back into the bowl as you work.Next, smooth the top by starting at the side farthest away from you,pulling toward the center of the cake.Repeat this step all the way around the cake until you have achieved the look you want.To take care of any flaws left,take a sheet of parchment,LIGHTLY dust with corn starch and lay on top of your cake.Now gently glide your spatula or a fondant smoother over the surface.Slowly remove parchment.Hopefully this will help you.Good luck|`|hT7BhNamaa	Due in July, what can I say, Sonya G is right on the money, I could not have answered as clearly as Sonya.

Don't buy all teh processed crap, like chips/sodas etc.  Drink water, buy fresh meats to cook through out the week, buy frozen vegetables, and buy te fresh vegetables that are on sale.  Use the Debbie Meyers green bags to preserve fresh fruits/veggies.  Don't use boxed anything...just make a loop around the grocerie section, start in produce move to dairy, then meat.  The only thing I buy in the isles is whole wheat pasta, and good ole hunts plain tomato sauce.  You can add a 1/2 bell pepper, 1/4 onion, and 1 shredded chicken breast along with 1 tbsp italian seasoning and it's better than any of the jarred stuff, and cheaper to.  That's another way to make meat stretch, fix 1 breast/beef/pork whatever, shred it and put it in a casserole, sandwiches, etc.  It will actually be a full serving because people now are breading godzilla chickens that have over a half pound of meat on one breast.

Value pack versions of cereals, milk and other staples. Make your own yogurt at home with some culture and milk, that you can flavour with bananas and thawed strawberries. Dry spices, except cilantro because you need some green to liven up your dishes and make them look sophisticated and that's a very inexpensive way.

Kroger and Tom Thumb actually have better prices on alot of things than Walmart, and their meat, poultry & fish is ALOT better.  You get buy extra-lean beef and make meat loaf, mashed potatoes & green beans ... chili with fresh salsa and a green salad ... Tilipia or salmon to BBQ (a can of salmon costs about $2 and you can get 4-6 salmon patties from that) ...  Chicken thighs/leg sections are about $2 for a package of 3 at Kroger (today) and most of their chicken pkgs are buy 1-get 1 free (Tom Thumb does that alot too).    Have fresh green salad and sliced strawberries (or fruit salad) with every meal  ...  Thick pork chops are good stuffed or on the BBQ.

Especially the ones with the creamy center!!

(donut not pickle).  The hole on the side is much smaller than a traditional donut that has one in the center, so it will be able to grip your pickle more firmly. Plus, the jelly will make it easy to slide the pickle in.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your cooking venture!

p0mczaAsaa	The best kind of milk in terms of nutrients and taste is ORGANIC  2% cow milk, has all the nutrients and vitamins with less fat than whole milk. <br>  But if you're watching your calories then go for skim milk or 1%.<br>  <br>  Organic is the key though because regular milk may contain growth hormones that were fed to the cows to increase their milk production for more sales =(|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	Dog milk is better than cat milk, it may be the type of food Im giving them, im not sure, and it is less trouble to milk a dog, they seem to enjoy it more than cats....|`|ILpp3ncYaa	1%|`|7I7a6Dmuaa	Assuming you mean cow milk...<br>  <br>  It depends on what your goals are. To lose weight, skim milk is obviously the best since it contains no fat, and whole milk (A.K.A. vitamin D milk) the worst. If your goal is to gain weight, then whole milk may be what you want. Of course, you don't have to go for extremes, as there is 1% or 2% milk if you don't want to drink whole milk.<br>  <br>  Even if you do want to gain weight, there are better ways than whole milk, as the saturated fat in whole milk is unhealthy, and you could gain the weight by eating more of other, healthier foods.<br>  <br>  Also, I believe Vitamin D milk is the best for young children, but I'm not a doctor, so you should consult with one before making any decisions.|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	I'm over 50, I'm not over weight not even a little bit.

hT7BhNamaa	x_kiita I answered katie not long ago, I would go Luau/ with the Hawaiian concept. Here you can go nuts with making non alcoholic drinks like a tropical pineapple punch etc. Then you can have platters of tropical fruit, ie: melon, papaya, mango etc. Go with the BBQ concept you could have marinated seafood skewers. BBQ pork like baby back ribs lightly and I mean lightly brushed with an asian prepared plum sauce. Your guest come dressed for the them. <br>  <br>  Yes I would kick it off in the afternoon, so that way all the cooking is finished with and squared away, and move into your pirate buried treasure hunt.<br>  <br>  Don't forget, for music I would have slow tropical Hawaiian music as back ground music as your guests arrive before boosting it up.

wbVd38d2aa	I'm pretty sure it's the same thing.  I think the Americans might call it all purpose, in Australia we call it plain.|`|0eaFftjyaa	they are the same thing, i think the americans must call it all purpose|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	It's plain flour as opposed to self-raising or strong plain flour which is for bread.|`|VSeHVIXOaa	Its same as plain flour.|`|UrcZFD8Laa	All purpose flour, is normal flour, plain flour what ever you want to call it this is why it is called all purpose flour because it is all purpose.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Yes, in the U.S. we call plain flour "all purpose".  That is how we differentiate it from bread flour (higher protein = higher gluten), cake flour (lower protein = less gluten), and self-rising, which is simply A.P. flour with added leavening.|`|769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	What exactly does your recipe call for?  <br>  <br>  To decide which type is best for the kind of baking you do, it helps to understand that flour is made up of carbohydrates (or starch), proteins, and in the case of whole-wheat flour, a bit of fat. Of these three nutrients, protein matters most to the baker. The proteins in wheat are called gluten-forming proteins, and the quantity and quality of these proteins determines how a flour will perform in the kitchen.<br>  <br>  A high percentage of protein means a harder (stronger) flour best suited to chewy, crusty breads and other yeast-risen products. Less protein means a softer flour, best for tender and chemically leavened baked goods, like pie crusts, cakes, cookies, and biscuits.<br>  <br>  Since the protein content of wheat can range from 5% to 15%, the flour industry has established labeling standards that help us find the right flour for our needs.<br>  <br>  Unless you're an avid bread or cake baker, an all-purpose flour is probably your best choice. It's made with an average protein content to be versatile enough for everything from cakes to breads. In general, you may find that cakes made with all-purpose flour are a bit tougher and less delicate than those made with a softer pastry or cake flour. Likewise, breads made with all-purpose flour may be a bit softer and flatter than those made with bread flour. But overall, these differences should be slight for the casual baker.<br>  <br>  If a recipe calls for a certain type of flour and all you have is all-purpose, some manufacturers recommend using 1 tablespoon more per cup when making breads and 1 tablespoon less per cup for cookies and biscuits. This will increase or decrease the total amount of protein going into the batter or dough.<br>  <br>  Within categories of flour, there's also a range in amount of protein between different brands. It's also important to know that, despite its high protein content, whole-wheat flour has to be mixed with all-purpose flour to form a light loaf (the bran in whole-wheat flour tends to cut gluten strands, reducing elasticity).<br>  <br>  Beyond the differences in protein content, there are also a few distinct specialty flours. Cake flour, the lowest protein flour, has undergone a special bleaching process (distinct from the process used for other white flours) that increases the flour's ability to hold water and sugar. This means that when you're making baked goods with a high ratio of sugar to flour, the flour will be better able to hold its rise and will be less liable to collapse.<br>  <br>  Self-rising flour is a relatively soft all-purpose flour to which baking powder and salt have been added. Manufacturers suggest using it for biscuits, quick breads, and cookies and eliminating the baking powder and salt called for in the recipe.

VwxX8kDRaa	It's hard to say.. You'd want to water it down to milk consistency and the sweetness could be an issue.  How much regular milk do you have?  If you're close, it may be better to water it down instead (assuming you use whole milk) - since 2% should work fine as well.<br>  <br>  For the condensed milk, I'd probably double it with water then set aside a small amount of pudding mix and test the result before committing to it.  That way you can try to adjust it.

DUR4aSXQaa	You need to get an express power yeast from your local home brew store its about 8 dollars. It will eat about 10 pounds of sugar in 24 hours and you can create a pretty high alcohol content beer or hard cider. <br>  I would recommend making a hard cider with the power yeast.  you can get get an organic cider with out any preservatives simmer it for about 30 minutes, you can get creative here and add spices, fruits, extract and/or honey. next add the specified amount of sugar for the yeast and make sure it is fully dissolved (you can very your ending alcohol by volume and sweetness/bitterness by varying the amount of sugar you add). After that let the cider cool to the temperature specified on the yeast add the cider to a fermenter then add the yeast and let it sit in a fairly warm room for 24 hours.  add to bottles cool and enjoy. good drink that is fairly inebriating.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	not gonna happen

Heat 1 Tbsp of oil on medium high heat (hot enough to sear the meat). Sprinkle and rub salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning all over the meat. Brown roast in pot, all over, several minutes on each side. Don't move the roast while a side is browning, or it won't brown well. <br>  <br>   <br>  2 When roast is browned, lift up the meat and add garlic and chopped onion to the bottom of the pan. Let the roast sit on top of the onions. Add 1/2 cup of red wine. Cover. Bring to simmer and then adjust the heat down to the lowest heat possible to maintain a low simmer when covered (we cook our roast on the warm setting of our electric range)*. Alternatively, you can cook the pot roast in a 225°F oven, once you have browned it on the stovetop, and brought the liquid to a simmer (make sure to use an oven proof pan).<br>  <br>  3 Cook for 3 1/2 to 4 hours, until meat is tender. (If you are using a pressure cooker, cut the time by half). Near the end of the cooking, add carrots, cook until tender, about an additional 10 minutes. <br>  <br>  <br>  After cooking 3 1/2 hours, before adding the carrots. Note how much liquid has been released by the meat. This comes from slow cooking at a very low temperature. If your pot roast is too dry, make sure the pan you are using has a tight fitting lid and that you are cooking at the lowest possible heat to maintain the low simmering.<br>  <br>  Serves 4-5. Suggest serving with green beans and potatoes<br>  <br>  *If you use a gas range, you may find difficulty getting the flame low enough. A tip I recently read in Cook's Illustrated suggests tightly rolling up some aluminum foil, shaping it into a skinny donut, and putting that on top of the burner to create a little more distance between the range and the pan.

Preheat oven to 375?F.<br>  Cover both sides of brisket with lots of pepper. Over<br>  a medium flame, heat the oil in a heavy casserole or<br>  roasting dish and brown the brisket on all sides. Take<br>  the brisket out of the pan and set aside. Add the<br>  onions to the casserole and cook them over medium-high<br>  heat. As you stir them, scrape up the brown bits from<br>  the bottom of the casserole. cook the onions for about<br>  15 minutes, or until they are thoroughly browned. Add<br>  the carrots, garlic, and bay leaves; stir for another<br>  1-2 minutes. Take the casserole off the burner and<br>  carefully put the brisket back into its nest of<br>  vegetables. Coat the brisket on both sides with tomato<br>  paste. Sprinkle more pepper, and a little salt, over<br>  the tomato paste. Pour the tomatoes and red wine into<br>  the bottom of the casserole. Cover the casserole<br>  tightly, first with a layer of foil and then with the<br>  lid. Let the pot roast cook on the middle rack of the<br>  oven for 3? hours. check the liquid level in the<br>  casserole frequently; if it gets too low, add a little<br>  water or beef broth.

When seasoning food, it comes with practice, like everything else. It also depends how much salt you like or don't like, and if you are adding other ingredients to the chicken like vegetables. <br>  <br>  For individual pieces of chicken, assuming there aren't any other seasoning salt being used, use a table salt shaker, take a drum stick for example. Do about 3 dashes on one side,  turn it over, do another 2-3 dash then rub the chicken drum to spread the salt. That should help give you a measurement of how much salt to use for one piece without it being too salty or bland. For bigger pieces, increase the dashes of salt.
