162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	I have learned that some people neither want the truth nor a considered opinion.    Asking for a critique does not necessarily mean that a critique is *really* wanted.  I have learned that mediocre snapshots of tennis shoes and unflattering portraits made in bathrooms are thought of as high art, especially when outrageous amounts of post-processing are applied.  I have learned that out of focus centered flowers with burnt highlights should be in magazines.    I have learned that Photoshop can fix any exposure mistake and make a crappy snap into fine art.  I have learned that buying better cameras will make you a better photographer.  I have learned to shoot weddings all you need to do is ask what lens and settings to use.   To start a photography business, all you need is a name.  Sorry, this appears to be more than one thing!|`|n4KoinUpaa	I've learned that when asking for critique, unless you type like a simpleton, you'll only get about 5 answers.  Plus you get those who, while they have a vague understanding of photography, don't really have enough real world experience to know that not everything benefits from an "interesting" angle and that some subjects are better shot from a straight-on angle.    That, despite all the careful exposure calculations, people will call just about anything a snapshot.    That people glorify photoshop as a "digital darkroom". I mean, it's editing, nothing more, nothing less.    I've also learned that some people consider it a "photo" when you essentially make a collage.    And that there is a disproportional number of people who rely solely on editing, and that these things come in waves, e.g. Selective colouring, HDR, etc.  And I've been amazed at how few people can see the huge "Search for question" and the subsequent search bar next to it. And I've been impressed at the strange names people have called these editing techniques, such as "Colour Pop" for Selective Colouring.|`|k8AcVixTaa	The total disrespect for the history of photography as a whole.  The lack of respect to film photographers who haven't bought into the whole digital craze.  The calling of software programs a "digital darkroom" or film cameras as "analog" cameras.  Total BS.    Oh, and the total narcissism of people who live in the Myspace or Face book grip.  Total  jerkwads.|`|tHdEQdVqaa	The most discouraging thing I have learned is that people think that all they need to have to become a professional is a dslr.  They then proceed to put the camera on monkey mode and offer their services as wedding, portrait, or some other kind of photographer so they can make lots of money.      Sadly I think that digital has dumbed down peoples expectations of what photography really is.  People have no idea what a fine art photograph really is and the amount of work that really goes into getting the proper exposure and an archived print.  I weep for the future.|`|AA12323486	Wedding photography is now in the hands of beginners with little point and shoot cameras.    Some things are gone forever, like burned out highlights and formatted images.    Cameras have become ever more disposable than before.  That means they are filling up our landfills even faster.

Second, there are always exceptions to the "norms"...  Third, they tell us very little about "the truth".    However, all that having been said:  AA's in the US during the 50's were living (on average) well below "middle class".  However, they were far more socially mobile than they had ever been during their American existence.  Therefore, there was some hope.  That hope turned into action in the 60's.    Jobs tended to be menial.    Salaries tended to be less than their white counterparts (even for the same work).    More tended to find themselves in jail, on probation, or otherwise running afoul of the law.    Fewer had High School education, and the education in the "public" institutions was often segregated (meaning that the best teaching talent was likely at the "white school")|`|bXl12I4Baa	I have been in Florida in 50es.as a European it was very hard for me to understand.

Some people think it should still be separated - it would be good for people to know why, lest we forget.|`|t79pLOCUaa	Not many really.  The country was divided into 4 sectors; French, British, Us and Russian with Berlin, whilst in the Russian zone, was also divided into 4.  During the 50s the allied zones were combined to make West Germany, and West Berlin, whilst the Russians kept their zone and called it East Germany, and made it part of the Communist Bloc.  After the Berlin Wall fell the country was reunited.  During West Berlin's existence it became an extremely successful exporting country.  This was because the US delivered the 'Marshall Plan' which entailed economic aid after the 1945 defeat, so as to avoid the mistakes that happened after WW1, and to help W Germany provide a barrier to further communist expansion..  West Germany was a founder member of what is now the EU.  Some think (me) that the EU is a continuation of German hegemony in Europe.  I don't really think Germany was punished enough.

44ujDxwqaa	Ethical egoism is one of the major forms of consequentialist theory( a theory which argues that human beings ought to act in a way that brings about the best possible results from their action)    Ethical Egoism argues that one ought to work to promote one's own good.  Utilitarianism maintains that one ought to work for the good of all those affected by an act.    They are similar in a manner that both forms look to the positive consequence of an act to determine whether it is right  They differ in respect to who ought to benefit from the positive consequence.    An example of utilitarianism is doing what is right in form of  sacrifice. One will endure sufferings so that others may live. Ethical egoism, is doing what is right for one's own success and benefit.
HS7qRRiWaa	The ruling clan or family in a region would have a strict hierarchy and people were treated quite harshly. Of course there were differences in different areas but in most of Europe was ruled by the Romans and they were not too friendly unless you agreed to be subjugated by them. Other than the Romans, most land were ruled by a warlord and most people lived a hand to mouth existence.  Men were treated as their station dictated and had the best chances for good treatment as they could rise in politics, etc.  Women with few exceptions were treated as property and or second class citizens.  in some societies children were seen as wealth because they could be put to work or be married off for a dowry.|`|Q6fj7jDLaa	They lived to be 20-30 on average (though the average is just an average and most people who survived infancy lived much longer; infant mortality rates at the time are what brought life expectancies so low).

DiDrmkJxaa	A huge part of what makes us human is our ability to ponder and attempt to comprehend the big questions such as life and love...      Some people do believe they understand life, and the reasons why we are here... I think to find an answer creates a feeling of security and safety, which many people need in order to live happily. Therefore people cannot 'submit to the mystery that life is' because they need it to have a meaning that will motivate them and perhaps even promise a reward at the end.     I know that i do not understand 'life'... but i don't want to. The most important thing is that you make the most of what you've got...|`|K2pdxaadaa	Who've you been talking to? I don't know ANYONE who has ever thought they've had it "all figured out."    That's silly.

It is those who hand over the steering wheel while in the driver's seat, that end up in a ditch. I drive my car despite my lacking knowledge of how it works. I CONTROL it, but I don't KNOW it.

b620ee9ffe6252c90305858258e1bd65aa	I think here you will find it:  Adams again acted on his anti-slavery convictions when he helped argue the Amistad case before the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1839 two planters in the Spanish colony of Cuba purchased a group of about 50 Africans who had been transported there in violation of bans on international slave trading. After obtaining false identification papers in order to establish their status as legal slaves in Cuba, the planters placed the Africans on the ship L'Amistad and joined them on a voyage to another part of Cuba. After several days at sea the Africans killed the captain, took over the ship, and ordered the planters to sail to Africa. Instead, the planters secretly navigated toward the United States. When the U.S. Coast Guard seized the ship off the coast of Long Island, New York, the planters accused the Africans of murder and sought to have them returned to Cuba as slaves.     After a trial court concluded that the Africans had never legally been slaves and should be returned to Africa, the U.S. government appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. Due to his alignment with a proslavery faction of the Democratic Party, president Martin van Buren favored the return of the Africans to the planters. However, the Supreme Court, after hearing lengthy arguments by Adams, agreed with the trial court and ruled that the Africans were free. With money raised by abolitionists, 35 of the survivors returned to West Africa in 1842. The others had died at sea or while waiting trial.     http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_7615...  http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpag...

Make big choices and make different choices. The more you explore, the better you will become.|`|xdWzrpiOaa	There's more to acting than learning lines. Versatility is one of the main qualities a good actor should have: it's alright an actor being good at one type of character, but if that's all they're good at then you can't really call them talented. Emma Thompson is a brilliant actress for versatility: she's gone from Professor Trelawney to Nanny McPhee without any problem - and no one would believe it's the same actor! To a lesser extent Johnny Depp, who is SUPER talented, but I wouldn't say is as skilled as Emma Thompson. However, Johnny Depp has lots of originality, and addresses each of his roles in his own unique way: uniqueness is another key element an actor needs.  Now, some people wouldn't agree with me on this, but for me one of the best actors now is Alan Rickman. Yes, his voice is very distinct which sometimes works against him, and also the fact that he is usually typecast as the baddie - in the most well known films anyway. But if you want to know what real acting is, watch 'Mesmer'. It's a great film with Mr Rickman taking the role of Franz Anton Mesmer. Yes, you do recognise his voice, but watch his EYES. His eyes are so into the role; the film moved me a lot and his performance was OUTSTANDING. If you throw yourself into that film, you'll understand what great acting is.  So in answer to your question, there are lots of things that actors need to be good at what they do, but the main thing is to be able to act through your eyes. If an audience can see the character in your eyes then you've truly done your job.|`|vLF2uz9saa	being believable  Did you see Heath ledger in the dark knight?

5liN3A1laa	A bit of cut and paste below, go to the web site and read more.    Edited to add:  This discussion also needs to include the idea of Imperium.  Imperium in a broad sense translates as 'power'. In ancient Rome the concept applied to people, and meant something like 'power status' or 'authority', or could be used with a geographical connotation and meant something like 'territory'. It is not to be mistaken with 'auctoritas' (authority).    Each of the chief magistrates held some amount of imperium.  Dictators the most when they were elected.  But after that the Counsuls held the most (and those granted PROCONSULAR imperium)  When the constitution was working properly a Proconsul was someone who had been consul and then went to serve as a governor.  Therefore, his power, or imperium, was "proconsular"    The Roman Republic was governed by two Consuls, elected by selected parts of the population for one-year periods. There were two consuls to guard against one trying to claim absolute power or using trickery to obtain more influence. If one of the consuls was a weak character, though, it might unbalance the division of power. On selected occasions, the Senate could extend the Consul's term of office.      The Senators retained much of the state's power and legitimacy, especially religious authority and some economic and military rights. It was the Senate which made the central decisions affecting the Republic, and the ongoing battle with Senatorial aristocratic power was the key element in Roman history.

They were elected annually.    Pro-consuls were like governors of provinces.    All of these, including praetors and other offices, were called magistrates.
31N7XIohaa	Animal worship in ancient Egypt is part of the culture of daily life of Egyptians. Animals of every kind were respected and revered, as they were in close contact with deities and gods that the average Egyptian could not reach.     The cat in ancient Egypt, or miw (to see), was a sacred and respected beast. These small companions fascinated the Egyptians, and were venerated by all. It was in Egypt that the cat was first domesticated 4,000 years ago and where they were held in the most admiration and respect. There is evidence of wild felines around the banks of Egypt, but it was not until around 2000 BCE that the fully domesticated cat was brought into the houses of Egyptians.     The first domesticated Egyptian cats in Egypt were more than likely used for warding off the common asp and other snakes, and the typical chasers of rodents. Slowly though, the cat became more to the Egyptians than just a normal animal, the cat became a god.     During the New Kingdom (1540 to 1069 BC), there were many tomb scenes that started showing cats as part of everyday life. The ancient Egyptians took their cats on hunting excursions instead of dogs, The most popular excursions being the marshes where cats may have been trained to retrieve fowl and fish. Another very common scene in tomb paintings was the picturing of a cat seated underneath a woman's chair. Children had become known in their family as Mit or Miut, showing great affection not only for the child but for the cat as well. Statues of cats were placed outside the house to protect the inhabitants and to ward off evil spirits. This showed scientists that the cat had become an integral part of the ancient Egyptian family life.     Mafdet was the first Egyptian feline deity, sometimes depicted as a lynx, but the most famous cat goddesses in the world, first revered by the ancient Egyptians were Bastet (also known as Bast, Pasch, Ubasti) and the lion-headed Sekhmet.     Bastet had the roles of fertility, protector of children and the protector of all cats. Bastet became so popular infact that she became a household goddess. This goddess was called Bastet when in full cat form, and Bast when only having the head of one and the body of a beautiful woman. Bastet's counterpart was the goddess Sekhmet who represented the cat goddess' destructive force. Sekhmet is known as the goddess of war and pestilence. Together, Bastet and Sekhmet represented the balance of the forces of nature in Egypt.    http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/e...|`|t79pLOCUaa	It was worshipped as a god.

Dreams and nightmares are real too . . .  they have meaning, value and purpose, are subject to interpretation and reveal a lot about the dreamer and the characters in the dream.    So, maybe life, dreams are the same thing . . . . you know when you take time out to think things through that you're still part of the world. well dreams are the same. the material for dreams come from your everyday life and the way you understand your dreams, your life, the things you and other people do also come from everyday life.

Life is all a state of mind.|`|w6DJj1a8aa	thats what my grandaddy use to say or sing =)|`|fMfBAgOUaa	Define "real". Dreams exist, so how are they not "real"? Whos to say that our dreams arent our real life, and our "waking" hours arent our dreams? When you die, do you exist anymore? Is death simply waking up out of this dream, or eternal sleep? What if death is only a path to another "reality"? This question is as old as man, and will not be answered any time soon.    Edit (to utterly grotesque): I have had dreams in which I slept, and dreamed in my dream sleep, only to wake up twice. Once in my dream of a dream, and another waking me back into "reality". Whos to say that this life, this "reality" isnt just a multi-layered dream?     Here is another thing to think about. When you sleep and "dream", your human senses are dulled. You cant feel things well, you cant see well, you cant smell well etc (this is all relating to dreams of course.). So what if life is just a dream, when we wake up from it, will we be able to sense, feel and know things we never thought possible? Are our true senses dulled because what we percieve as reality, is only another dream? Will we be at one with the universe, or is that just a dream too?|`|qXTWnEzEaa	Those who say "Yes, life is real." cannot be real philosophers until they view it with an open mind.    Whether life is real or not is a question thousands have asked, and it is one no person can answer. This answer could just be a dream of yours.    You may even think it's like the Truman Show, where everything is revolving around you, except it is a dream.    Once you can realize that the question is unanswerable, and can view this question with a completely open mind, you are on the step towards being a philosopher, like the steps to enlightenment (Buddhism).|`|NRkQ0OEsaa	Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your going to get!|`|RDxwA15kaa	Yeah its only a dream, albeit a very realistic one.|`|f95837e2c58a8931580191a2a6bfe0d2aa	No one has been able to prove  conclusively either that it is or that it isn't.

RoqxGbgRaa	i do think you're too young to the explicit sex in zane books.  i'm almost 33, and i have only read one zane book!!    here's why i think this: picture your mind as a trap.  whatever you put in there is in there to stay.      so you may be planning to remain a virgin until you are married, and because it's so dangerous and deadly out here (HIV/AIDS, herpes, syphillis, etc), i hope you do remain one, but all the images and words and acts you're reading about now will just make it easier for you to take that step if ever you find yourself in a certain situation in the next few years.    there are PLENTY of wonderful books about there.  i won't even say young adult books because obviously, you're into adult-level literature. but there are great books for adults where the whole point of it all is not constant sexing.      besides, this is a good age for you to know that you're more than your body, and life is more than sex.  reading zane books all the time can shrink your whole universe down to one thing.  i teach high school, so i see it every day.  the zane readers are all hot and bothered and can't wait to give it away.  these are the ones who end up preggers and dropping out.  there are 9th graders here with kids!!    so make sure you're developing all your gifts and talents.  when you're grown and married, sex will be the icing on the cake.  don't be fooled into thinking it's everything.  that's just heartbreak waiting to happen.|`|yon7jR8Oaa	You are probably a little to young to be reading those books!!

The difference (to me) is that in the Zane books, or rather erotica, its about sex and power, not about love. I get angry when I read that kind of stuff, because its very derogatory to women. It could be a good way for you to start to think about the difference. It sounds like since you are asking, you might want some other authors that aren't so explicit. Some suggestions for urban fiction specifically for teens is K.C. Taylor, or series like Kimani TRU, Bluford, Hotlanta, Bad Girlz. I haven't read them, but its a place to start.

AA11562077	The officials were "in the league" -- in league with the Devil, whose followers just as often wash their hands at a critical moment as anything else.  "Game Over", they said.  The last pass was incomplete, and so was the game.    EDIT: True, hemp. The interception runback for a touchdown was for me the greatest single-handed football play I've ever seen.  Tyree's catch last year was miraculous, too.  But for pure sustained determination it's the sort of thing all boys dream about, but never achieve except on that field of dreams. It was, too, the difference in the game's final score.  Without it, the stage would never have been set for that last Steeler touchdown.    By the way, with both teams (once again) flying down the field to score touchdowns in the last two minutes of a tight game, isn't it time that the "Prevent Defense" be resigned to history along with the Bismarck and the Pushmi-Pullu?     Oh, and as for the Indians (below): with political correctness soon to force them to choose another mascot and name ("Native Americans"?  Nahhh.) -- how about the Cleveland Pushmi-Pullus?  I can see the headlines: "P-P's Lead League In Twin-Killings!", "P-P Double-Header Slated", "Progressive: Pushmi-Pullus Progress"...    And of course, conversely: "Browns Outs".|`|79f5a220cbaeaee23f7053e20846799faa	I reckoned they needed infinitely more cardinal numbers to win; instead they went out and hired a bunch of sissy cardinals from the Vatican, dangit.

IIa4efh5aa	Unless the church in question is some kind of landmark, there's not much to be gained from using the actual name. and, unfortunately, the priest or one of his flock might take offense at whatever action you might have occurring at the site.     real buildings figure prominently in many novels. the Da Vinci Code opens with a murder at the Louvre, and descriptions of period places run all through The Alienist. But a church's reliance on a good reputation is arguably stronger than that of many businesses.    best bet? Change a few details and name your parish after a particularly obscure saint.|`|yOK32PM9aa	This is a difficult question, because laws and customs are different in different countries.  In my country (UK) if you said things which could identify individuals because of naming a real place such as a church, they could sue you if they thought what you said was hurtful. It could be a form of libel.  You might also want to consider people's feelings.  If you identified their church and they didn't want it identified in the way that you characterise it, they might be upset.  Generally it is probably better to make up names, etc., and probably more fun and creative to do so.|`|WMNbGsoWaa	Yes, you can use real names and places. You know the print in the first page of a book that states "This book is a work of fiction. Any reference to historical events, real people, or real locations are completely fictional."    It's in movies, too, when they say actual resemblance to real people, living or dead, is pure coincidence at the end of the credits?    It's fine to use real locations and landmarks. If you're going to use a company, like WalMart, or a label, like Coke or Hollister, your publisher would probably have to get permission from these companies.|`|cciB0SmBaa	Martha,    Not a good idea without permission. If your book was to go to a publisher through a literary agent, the agent would ask you about this and make some comments. Even if an author is writing non-fiction, they take a big chance on getting sued if they use real names without permission.     I don't think real places matter because I've done this myself, but I would be really leary about using real names.     PJ M|`|YA36FUf1aa	Of course you can.

wYF6U6qlaa	I like your start! If you haven't already, you should check out "Sunshine" by Robin McKinley.  I see a lot of similarities in your main characters and even in some elements of your writing style.  Nicely done!    You have a great sense of progression and of dialogue.  You know how to capture a readers attention, which is the most important thing, really.    One suggestion I would make:    You don't have to get everything out right away.  You have an idea in your head of what this character consists of - what she can do - and you want the reader to know.  Great! But the trick to keeping the reader interested is to lead them along, keep them wondering, keep introducing little pieces of explanation as your story progresses.  I imagine you're planning on writing a short story, or a novella at the least.  So you have many, many pages and opportunities in the future to develop this character.  Keep in mind, if this was a published novel, this passage would only be 2 pages long.     "I could control fire. I could start it any time I felt like it, move it around to burn anything I pleased and turn it out anytime I wanted. The fires started usually when I was angry, or emotionally pressured.  I also had a knack of turning things into ash if I ran my hands on them for some time, therefore I avoided any kind of caressing on animals, or patting on backs."    This is a great idea, really fascinating! But instead of just telling the reader this information all at once, why not wait until they can see it for themselves?  Fire is a very dramatic element, you can paint a really good, exciting scene using fire.    You already demonstrated how expertly you can write an action scene, with the character mind-controlling her sister.   Let the reader digest what just took place, let us bond with the character a little more as she does something ordinary (so we can relate to her) and then add in the other abilities through scenes (showing, not telling).  Maybe after she has the argument with her sister, she goes into the backyard where her father is just lighting the charcoal for a barbeque.  Maybe she's a little emotional from the run-in with her sis, so she has to fight to control her urges to manipulate the fire.    I hope you don't think I'm criticizing.  Just suggestions I have as a reader.  Don't stop writing, you're doing so well!|`|MSEyXHFWaa	Oh great, I need a new French book.    Replace that comma with a semicolon.    "But I was used to them by now. "    With sentences it's best not to start with a preposition. : )    "Maybe, for fan fiction books they were awesome"  "I felt like the hero in a fantasy story"    You're dangerously close to breaking the fourth wall here.

yOK32PM9aa	I would place this near Bristol in England.  The "sunny" bit is a big problem, because England is more famous for fog and rain, but Bristol is not too bad.  There are hills nearby called the Mendips (limestone crags); another set called the Quantock Hills; and some further away called Exmoor. There are even some rocky crags near the centre of the city, where a house could be built into the hillside.  Bristol has quite a prestigious university in the centre of the city.  You could check out further details on  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol  to see if the city fits your needs. But this is the best one I can think of!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Maybe Bristol. Oxford really isn't hilly enough to qualify.    To be honest, though, you'd be far better off setting it near a city that you are familiar with in the country you live in. Otherwise chances are your story will just end up unintentionally howlingly funny to anyone who knows the location. There are plenty of published books by American authors, especially about Oxford, in that category.|`|S1YGHrRzaa	What about Oxford?! It's about 50 miles from London, it is as sunny as England will ever get, it definitely has a university and it does have hills... I'd say some 30 miles to the west... so...

Dumbledore looked at him intensely and chuckled. He took of his glasses and cleaned them with his robe.    "Well, Harry," he said. "I suppose it is time you knew." he gestured to his lap and Harry sat on it. Harry could barely contain his excitement and awe.     "Voldermort had always been attracted to men. He had his eyes on your father, Harry. He wanted to kill you and your mother so that he could seize James and give him the love potion his mother had once made. He didn't succeed, though. People say that your father fought valiantly for your life. The sad truth was that he tripped on a bucket and fell down the stairs. Voldie, in his blind rage attacked your mother out of anger. He tried to kill you, but you know what happened after that.."    Harry looked stunned at the story he had just been told. He looked as if he was going to cry.    "PSYCH!" screamed Dumbledore. "Voldermort isn't gay..." Harry looked relieved that the story was not true.    "... but I am," continued Dumbledore, staring at Harry in a seductive manner and wiggling is eyebrow. Harry immediately jumped off Dumbledore's lap.|`|vVR1BnTiaa	THIS IS THE RIGHT ANSWER. Voldemort found out about a prophecy, it said that a boy could kill him or something, It could've meant Harry Potter, OR Neville Longbottom, Voldemort chose harry, He tried to kill harry just to make sure the prophecy would not come true, since harry's mother protected him, he did not die, and the trace will go away when he turns 17, and he'll be vulnerable, This is all found in the 5th and 7th book.|`|SNeRRi8Haa	You should read the rest of the books.

AA11664474	First thing you have to do is realize the folks out there want you to succeed, not fail.  If you flub and cover it up, they'll forgive you.  Most won't even notice and those that do will say "Hey, she did pretty good for her age."  No one will remember it in a week.       The absolute worst thing that can happen is you'll fall down and someone with catch it and put it on YouTube.  If you fall down, get up laughing.  Style will save you.      The last Miss Universe (not the current one) was in a high profile fashion show in Australia when her skirt fell off.  REALLY fell off.   She giggled and ran backstage.  Her only comment was "If I'd known that was going to happen, I would have worn better knickers (panties)"      Things happen.  People rarely remember the event, but they might remember your style.   Relax.  Take a deep breath and sing for yourself or someone you like out in that audience.|`|yvvsrimNaa	sam here! exept im almost 14 but act like no1s thr or listening take deep breaths tell ur self u can do this picture evry n thr underwear=lol|`|scWUQhSxaa	relax it will all b ok  that wat u ahve 2 tell urselve   just close ur eyes u will have 2 open them sometimes but when u do pretend that no1 is looking at   try picturing them in thereundwear  dnt worry it will allm workk out|`|c4MKiOeCaa	Thats really good that you want to become a super star, a way to get rid of some stage fright is, to sing for youtube. and let the world decide for you, and if they like your voice, then show you parents, im sure your parents would love your voice. dont give up and follow your dreams.|`|SR9pkrGPaa	i am the same way im 13 years old i love to sing and act and i want a music and acting career i've audition for movies but i have stage fright. the way i got over my stage fright was that when i would sing in my room with the door closed i would sing really loud so my mom and sister could hear me, then i would play the guitar for them but not look at them. and now the way i really got over my stage fright is that i would sing and act and play the guitar and pretend no one is listening it really works. now i can sing and act and play the guitar in front of everyone and anyone. hoped i helped. p.s. DO NOT picture people in their underwear to help you with your stage fright because if you do that you will laugh and mess up.|`|4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	You never ever get rid of it completely. One just learns to manage it better. The most important thing to learn is that you will make a mistake - guaranteed, and guess what? It will not be the end of the world as you know it. You must accept the reality that you will sometimes make mistakes (most times ones that no one else hears except you and perhaps your teacher), probably a lot in the beginning, but you are not alone in this - it happens to EVERYBODY. After a while, something magical happens, and you perform well....and you know it. When you get that feeling, all of the previous performances fall by the way side. Keep trying, keep singing, don't give up. You will get better and you will get more confident.|`|mqMhrmloaa	This will take time - try singing to your audience with your eyes closed, that helps to take the pressure off. Don't open them until you're done.   - Get INTO your music! Really want to express emotion through it.   - Before you perform, inhale deeply through your nose, and exhale from your mouth. Slowly. Do this for a couple of minutes, this is a yoga breathing exercise. Each time you breathe in, hold for a quick second, and exhale slower after each inhalation.   ex: In - 2sec, Out - 3sec; In - 3s, Out - 4s; In - 4s, Out - 5s. This will relax you beforehand.  - Another pre-tension relaxer is to sit down with good posture, and clasp the base of your fingers between each other. Lightly squeeze your hands alternately.  - Try some of these options and ask your audience what you can improve on after your performance. The best way to get better is to be open to constructive criticism, and develop your performance from there.    Key thing, you can't be afraid of your own ability - it's only you doing what you do best. Which is being "you"!

Great Britain was (in their minds) only trying to maintain their empire.

d3zT4NFaaa	In this case, utility is defined by preference satisfaction, which may vary from person to person. The morally right action is the one that satisfies your preferences. This allows for differences and makes universality of morality difficult to achieve    The basic dichotomy in consequentialism is Rule vs Act. (though this dichotomy is debated). Act utilitarians simply say that the right actions are the one's that produce the greatest utility. So this allows for individual actions that may vary. In this sense preference satisfaction utilitarianism is a kind of Act utilitarianism.    Rule utilitarianism states that the right action is the action performed in accordance with a rule that when followed, will produce the greatest utility. So consider for example the rule of stopping at a red light. If this rule is followed then the greatest utility can be achieved. BUT this may collapes into Act utilitarianism when you consider ambulances or emergency situations. So in these situations you need to decide between following the rule or acting against the rule to satisfy your own desires or preferences in that instant.    Note that if you dont go down the path of Act utilitarianism, you are simply following a rule, which is NOT what consequentialism is about! John Rawls has an interesting theory that accounts for this difference.
9rQzQxexaa	the first 12 chapters were leaked illegally on the internet a few months ago, so stephenie announced on her website (www.stepheniemeyer.com) that for now the book is on hold.   i have heard rumors that the reason is because:  a) she is not sure whether to even bother to publish it because of the leak (all the fans have already read that, so theyll skip the first 12 chapters of the book when it comes out, anyway)  b) she is coming up with a whole new angle to write the book.  she will probably post it on her site when she does decide to publish it, so for now, just read the partial draft, and keep checking on her site until further notice!|`|E28mQDX0aa	No, she's not.

K60FfiIfaa	In the times leading up to Augustus the Republic was pretty much disfunctional.  It was prone to infighting, greed and class warfare, and could barely deal with the problems of the day.  Several critical issues, such as land reform and what to do with soldiers that had completed their service, festered for decades without any solutions.  Violence erupted frequently.  Civil wars were frequent.  The Republic was almost always in crisis.    Prior to Augustus, Julius Caesar had briefly grabbed supreme power and started some badly needed reforms.  But he was murdered before he could accomplish much, and the Republic fell into chaos for another generation.      After Augustus defeated Mark Antony, he marched on Rome.  Once there, backed up by his army, he became defacto ruler of all of Rome.  He worked with the Roman senate to have him granted several separate political offices, which effectively put him legally in charge for life, all the while maintaining the outward facade of the Roman Republic.  After that he set up a series of reforms to fix the problems with the government.  All this helped him to appear as a legitimate and legal ruler, who had the citizen's best interests at heart, rather than a power-hungry warlord bent on brutal world domination.      His rule was fair, just and effective, making him very popular.  I think by this time the populace was just happy to have peace and an effective government, even if it meant they weren't really a republic anymore.|`|AA11570236	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus  try this nobility I believe

How does it make you feel? What do you respect about it? What would you like to say to this person, or wish that you could say? What does it make you think about?    Brainstorm, just writing down these things as they come in to your head. You are not making a poem at this point, just putting things down on paper.    Later on, choose one or more themes from your brainstorming, and start working with those. If the poem is *for* the veteran, I would recommend choosing positive themes, you don't want it to make them feel depressed or angry.    How to get a poem from those topics is another discussion ;)|`|AA10516766	tell how brave he is and show his pride and bravety for his nation

Yes, I do somewhat agree with what Emerson says about nature being circular. I like to use the example of dying: we die- we get buried- we get decomposed- we go into the dirt- trees roots suck up nutrients from dirt- we go up into it- leaves fall, and cycle all over. I hope you get the picture I'm trying to draw, but I'm just pulling this out of my head.
Ys47rcdkaa	Sam Harris, the storys humorous eleven year old protagonist, is unable to participate in any fun activities such as play football, or walk to school with his friends. His overprotective mother is constantly afraid he will get injured.  When the Griswalds move in next-door however, Sam's boring existence comes to an end. The Griswalds, though funny people, weren't all they seemed. Reckless, they began doing crazy things like burning down the bus shelter. Problems evolve, and soon Sam and the Griswalds are desperately trying to find solutions.  Emma Barnes will absorb readers of all ages in this side-splitting book. The pictures by the illustrator, Tim Archbold, are also fantastic. Readers who like humour and adventure will love this really funny book. The  320 page paperback and hardcover versions of "Sam and the Griswalds" were published in 2004 by Bloomsbury Publishing Co.      This was very poorly written and a miserable read. It looks as though you were trying to combine a book description with an obnoxious television ad..|`|AA12300575	All looks good except there should be a comma after football soccer should not be in parenthesis and should have a comma after it as well.|`|wZzVuq8Iaa	There is nothing wrong except for the capital 'M' on 'mother' at "He cant do anything fun because his Mother is..."    This sounds good.|`|vLaEZWzPaa	First off, Ashley's right - mother oughtn't be capitalized. You also seem to use the word 'fun' quite a bit. Try rewording sentences or using synonyms to avoid this.    Also, there's a part that should be changed slightly for the sake or sentence flow. I'll rewrite it with a few minor punctuation and word changes:    Since Sam cant do anything interesting, hes bored - but not for long. Soon the hysterical Griswalds move in next door and Sam starts having some real fun; However, his mother is still interfering with his play. And even though the Griswalds are amusing company, they start causing trouble by doing reckless things such as burning down the bus shelter.    See, I didn't even change much, but it kind of reads easier, don't you think? Well, maybe - it's just my opinion.    Last thing, you left a sentence unfinished, like maybe you were already thinking of the next sentence and forgot to complete the previous:    Emma Barnes will absorb readers of all ages into this side splitting...?    That's something I do all the time, actually. I'll be in the middle of one sentence, and then write the next without so much as a period. :)    Other than that, it's pretty good. Believe it or not, it's actually better than a lot of the writing people in my high school yearbook class do.

Lighter oils evaporate in air leaving behind the heavier oils in tar pits. People have used this naturally occurring oil since the beginning of recorded human history. Oil can also be made from animal fat, and it is not always clear whether mention of oil in ancient records refers to oil from the ground or from animals.    Ancient Greek texts describe how they would pour oil onto the sea to set fire to their enemies fleets. The Bible refers to a thick form of oil called "Pitch" which was used to waterproof Noah's ark and the baby Moses' basket. The American Indians also used pitch to waterproof canoes and to make warpaint and medicines. These examples are probably uses of oil from the ground.    The word Petroleum come from the Greek word for rock and the Latin for oil or fat. It literally means oil that comes from rock.  petra / petros (Greek) = rock  oleum (Latin) = oil / fat    Crude oil was pumped from the ground in Sichuan, China, 2500 years ago, but the history of oil wells as we know them today is much younger. A brief history starting in 347 A.D:     347 Oil wells are drilled in China up to 800 feet deep using bits attached to bamboo poles.  1264 Mining of natural oil seeps in medieval Persia is witnessed by Marco Polo on his travels through Baku.  1500s Seep oil collected in the Carpathian Mountains of Poland is used to light street lamps.  1594 Oil wells are hand dug at Baku, Persia up to 35 meters (115 feet) deep.  1735 Oil sands are mined and the oil extracted at Pechelbronn field in Alsace, France.  1815 Oil is produced in United States as an undesirable by-product from brine wells in Pennsylvania.  1848 First modern oil well is drilled in Asia, on the Aspheron Peninsula north-east of Baku, by Russian engineer F.N. Semyenov.   1854 First oil wells in Europe are drilled 30- to 50-meters deep at Bbrka, Poland by Ignacy Lukasiewicz.    Oil historians in the USA give credit for the first modern commercial oil well to Colonel Edwin L. Drake. His well reached a depth of 22m (72-ft). It was drilled in Oil Creek near the town of Titusville, slightly east of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA and started producing oil on August 28,1859. There were no automobiles in those days; the main market for petroleum was for medicine. It was called Rock Oil and sold for about $40 a barrel, which is about the same as a barrel of oil costs today, so it would have been worth a lot of money in 1859.    There are several other claims for the first oil well, including a well drilled in 1858 in Wietze, Germany. This area, locally nicknamed Little Texas now houses a petroleum museum (the Deutsches Erd?lmuseum).    The first offshore oil well was in the bayous (swamps) of Louisiana, USA during the 1950s. The first drilling in open sea was done in 1955 for Shell Oil in the Gulf of Mexico just south of New Orleans. This used a barge with a drill rig attached named Mr. Charlie", which continued to drill in the Gulf of Mexico for 32 years.|`|ZntkO9ffaa	Happened over 9000 years ago and was not documented.|`|AA12300575	Jed Clampett :) I don't know for sure.|`|VYlCgujxaa	Happened way to long ago to know.

p2jBCUU6aa	Even among the most venerable galleries, the problem that you are experiencing is not all that uncommon. Do you have a lawyer who you or your family has worked with in the past? If so, no matter how close your relationship with the directors of the gallery may have been in the past, this is business and must be handled as such. If you do have access to a lawyer, I would suggest sending the gallery a letter via certified mail (requires a signature from the recipient) DEMANDING payment in full within ten business days and if payment is not received state that you will have your legal counsel file suit against the gallery for non payment (always helps to be able to mention the name of a lawyer in the letter). If the amount owed is small enough, take it to small claims court immediately. No matter, you must move as quickly as possible and demonstrate to the gallery that you are indeed extremely serious about this. Usually if a gallery is threatened they will pay, although, some dealers are suborn enough to wait until they are sued.    Did you have a consignment agreement with the gallery? If you need any further advice feel free to send me the specifics via email and I'll try to give you some additional ideas.|`|afc818594423abb198b9222afe9865c9aa	You've waited long enough, it's time for you to take them to small claims court. Send them a registered letter of your intent and follow through. After you file the court will serve them with a notice to appear. If they try to stall by saying they want to work it out, tell them to pay you in full and you will withdraw your claim against them. Also, tell them you will file a report with the Better Business Bureau with copies of the courts judgment against them.

A long time ago I thought that love was something that you reserved for some special set of people that you had judged worthy of it.     After a while I got to thinking about what Jesus had said about turning the other cheek and loving our neighbor I put the two together and realized that he had made no exceptions in these statements. It became obvious to me that he intended that we exclude no one from the love that we are supposed to be giving. I started thinking about my idea of love and suddenly realized that I had not been loving anyone at all. I had simply been judging everyone and every thing.    Judging someone worthy of love is not love, it is only judgment. I actually started to cry when I realized this. I saw just how much of my life I had wasted being judgmental, thinking of myself as a Christian, when I was actually doing just the opposite of what Jesus had asked us to do.    I thought about the verse judge not lest ye be judged, and I understood it for the first time.    I realized that I have a lot of catching up to do. So many opportunities were wasted. I now try to apply the love that I have for the world in a universal way like Jesus asks us to do.     If I start to feel afraid and think that I see someone that I should not love because of something I have thought or heard I try to catch my mistake as soon as possible. I tell myself that I have forgot the truth and have fallen for the same old trick that had cost me so many opportunities to be loving in the past. The horror of this realization is often all that is necessary to bring me back to my senses and make me drop the judgmental nonsense I was thinking.    I still have a lot to learn about love, but at least Im making progress.

CqggXw15aa	You have to be a high school graduate to go to a college to major in photography. It helps if you are on the school yearbook or newspaper staff. There are several good colleges for photography, either art institutes or a traditional four year college. If you want to major in photojournalism then check out Ohio University or the University of Missouri in Columbia. Both have acclaimed photography programs.     Photography has come a long way since the old 35mm cameras. I would suggest shooting with all formats and doing some CAD programs as well. If you go to a four year college you will have to take courses that may not relate to photography (Art History, Political Science, etc.) so you may want to go to an art institute where you will have more hands on experience.    Many colleges offer work-study programs relating to your major or an apprenticeship where you can learn even more. All of the photo majors that I graduated with are not working in their field. It is an expensive field to be in with all of the supplies to buy. The pay is usually based per photo if the AP or another bureau pick up the photo. You could open your own portrait studio if you want to shoot weddings and the like.  You do not want to work for a store photographer though. Not enough pay and it would limit your talent.

Many of them knew how to use the environment to their advantage like using advanced farming techniques but they only used what was necessary to survive.    The Sumerian culture was the first really massive civilization, the empire began conquering foreign and nearby lands to obtain enough wood, metal and primarily land for their people to live on. But when they had used almost of the trees that were available to them the environment began to fall apart and turned to sand, the great civilization was destroyed in just a short time.    The Greeks and then the Romans made just about the exact same mistake, they even began to pay farmers to plant olive trees because they were all that would live in much of their dry, nutrient-less soil. We in the Western World are all doing the exact same thing as all of those cultures, using up all of the oil, gas and water that we have available to us. For hundreds of thousands of years our ancestors lived off of the land but now we're killing the Earth to return the favor. We fail to realize that we are permanently attached to the fate of this planet, but we've become like a cancer fighting against ourselves and destroying the environment.    I definitely work because I need the money to pay for school and living expenses. We definitely need to tax the hell out of the wealthy and corporations in order to support social programs. I've read that we in the United States have the most people imprisoned of any country.

U8Ym6Iauaa	drawing is basically hand-eye coordination  it is also a skill  like any other skill, you have to practice to improve it  its also a fact that some are born with better hand-eye coordination than others  thus enabling them to draw better  people that are not born with this natural talent have to practice much harder than those who are  ultimately, they may never be as good as the naturals, but they can still become excellent drawers  drawing is like anything else  like how some are naturally good at math  naturally good at english  naturally have a good ear for music|`|Dr2NwYhqaa	It is all about hand eye coordination.  The more you practice looking at the object in front of you and seeing the lines instead of assuming where the lines are the easier it will be for you.  You cannot achieve anything without practice and that is all.  Start doing blind contour drawings where you only look at the object you are drawing and you never look at your paper until you are done.  Also, you are rarely done when you think you are.  As a professional artist, I may spend weeks and weeks on one drawing.  You need to make sure you have the whites and the blacks and every gray (minimum of 8) in between for a good drawing.  The most common mistake that beginners make is not looking or paying attention to the details so then their drawings do not have the details.|`|g8kIjpwSaa	Ignore that. Talent has NOTHING to do with it. People aren't born good drawers. It takes time, dedication, and practice. In fact, studies show that it takes a minimum of 10,000 hours of practice to "master" any skill.    Work on the basics. Teach yourself to draw straight lines and perfect circles. It will build something called "muscle memory". It will build a better neurological connection between your hand and your eyes. Then go from there. Take some classes. Get some drawing books at a bookstore. Collect drawings you like from other people. Study them close. Look at a drawing you like for thirty seconds and try to replicate it without looking. Then go back and look. What did you miss? What details did the artist think of that you didn't?    Like I said it takes time and anyone who puts in the time and truly wants to get better...will get better.|`|yUWa6WpEaa	you should look for a book called "Drawing on the Right side of the brain."  It has lots of exercises and is very  as you say "scientific    and please do not let anyone tell you can't or don't have DNA to do it.     Thomas Edison said "genius is one percent inspiration an ninety nine percent perspiration"       Art is very little about talent and a lot about hard work.|`|rwtiLgH1aa	scientific ? There isn't much scientific about it, you just have to practice allot.  Drawing is a skill the more you draw the better your get. When copying something you see, the right side of your brain is involved allot though, becuase you have to be able to translate the 3d world you are seeing into 2d view onto your paper.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	people who are very good at drawing are usually good bc their hands are more sensitive to movement which gives them the ability to actually feel the lines they draw, in the way. it takes very light hand to shade properly, which not very many people can. it's possible to learn how to do it, u'd have to learn how to have "soft" hands and very flexible to movement.|`|be8c12cdca22b46ac7dcd7d626901063aa	You just do not have this talent , that's all .|`|o79pcjrpaa	Genetics.   You may not have inherited the skills for drawing.|`|uJBnZWtcaa	It has to do with brain wiring.  I once had a 14 year old student in my science class that couldn't end a drawing, no matter how simple, back where he'd started it.  He couldn't even come close to drawing a circle, triangle, square. He could draw nothing except some straight lines and some curves that went nowhere.  And he'd signed up for Art as an elective.  Because of his difficulties, he was tested and found to have little hand-eye coordination.  It all has to do with being able to coordinate what your eye sees with what your hand does.  Usually young children lack hand-eye coordination.  That's why they can't write well until they're in 2nd or 3rd grade.  It takes practice to develop the neural (nervous system)  circuits.  Sometimes, in some people, those circuits just never develop well.    Oh, my student didn't take Art after all;-)

nSwwHot4aa	Yeah, I got that book for my 17th Birthday a few months ago. i just started it, and will do my best to explain.    (Existence precedes essence)  Man creates meaning in this world. He is not pre-determined, nor does some teleological force guide him to a fate.  (An objects appearance is it's essence manifesting itself)  Dualism is false in stating that there are many "worlds within themselves" and that the true universe is beyond our comprehension, and out of reach of the senses. All too often dualists attempt to refute reason by using there own reason, labeling reason unreliable by using methods of reason. An object, if it exists, simply appears in it's true essence.  (Nothingness is not a thing)  Nothingness is simply the ABSENCE of a thing. Nihilation is a return to nothingness from being, only capable of that which may be destroyed (The human conscience), and not simply changing form (Like a tree being burnt down by a lightning bolt)  -Hopefully, more to come. I have only read 100 pages, and haven't gotten too into it yet. Sartre is often misunderstood, and one of the most in depth philosophers to have ever lived. I attempt to be careful in explaining his views, I am actually currently reading a chapter on the origin of nothingness, which should be interesting.  It's a good read, although a little drawn out, and quite an ordeal to finish.|`|1243f4e8337cd349f01721fab2d47a02aa	Read the short pamphlet (by Sartre) the Existentialism is a humanism. That will give you an idea of the more anthropological (related to man, not ontological) aspects of his doctrine as stated in Being and Nothingness.     In the meantime... Nothingness only exists when we have expectatives. The glass is empty because we expect to see water. Hence, nothingness is related to possibility. Possiblity is in us, and more radically, Sartre thinks that we are pure possibility/nothingness.     According to Sartre, freedom has no limits. Each man is completely free to do anything upon his reach. He/she is pure possibility. Sartre equates this to nothingness. A person is only the conjunction of all his actions, before acting he isn't defined by anything (has no essence). In the case of persons, "existence determines essence" and not otherwise. Human objects are built with a purpose, scissors are built for cutting, hence the "essence" of scissors determines its existence (it must have blades, be hand-sized, etc).     But men are not made by anyone with a purpose in mind (Sartre was an atheist), and have no true tendencies. Hence, existence (actions) is what determines essence (what one is).       When someone says he is unable to do something (quit smoking, studying regulaarly, etc) it is only out of "bad faith". It is because that person is not willing to accept his absolute freedom. This freedom is actually unescapable, to stop choosing is itself a choice. Bad faith is only a kind of self deceit.     This nature of being "nothingness", Sartre calls it etre-pour-soi (being for self, i guess is the translation). However, we can only catch our own nature of etre-pour-soi, we don't see other people as being completely free. We see other people as "objects" in a way (etre-en-soi, being in itself). Hence, we are unable to respect other people's absolute freedom and self determining through existence, as we are unable to apprehend them as we apprehend our own "nothingness".

Bianca knows she doesn't fit in.    Then she meets Lucas. He's not the "Evernight type" either, and he likes it that way. Lucas ignores the rules, stands up to the snobs, and warns Bianca to be carefuleven when it comes to caring about him.    "I couldn't stand it if they took it out on you," he tells Bianca, "and eventually they would."    But the connection between Bianca and Lucas can't be denied.

Suze is a mediator, whose role is to help ghosts finish their business on earth so they can pass on to the afterlife. To this end, she can see, touch, communicate with, hit, punch, and 'kick ghost butt' when she has to. The series begins just after Suze's widowed mother marries Andy Ackerman, when she has moved to Carmel, California, to live in an old house complete with three stepbrothers. To make matters worse, her bedroom is haunted by an attractive male ghost named Jesse de Silva, who died 150 years earlier. Suze remembers that back in New York a fortune teller had told her that she was a mediator (which proved correct) and that she would only fall in love once but it would last for an eternity. Her one love for eternity just might be Jesse. But does he love her back?    I loved this series more than twilight. Worth reading trust me!

I get very little of that, so it really is like a spice and not the main meal in my case. I'm a lawyer and a writer, so mostly I work indoors. What creates vivid memories for me is trips out West -- to Canyonlands or Painted Desert or Great Meteor Crater, and trips to New England in the Fall, and sailing on the Chesapeake Bay.    The really spicy stuff, I don't talk about publicly, not because of prudishness, but because I was raised to think that some matters are best if kept private, and not publicly displayed. I know that in our new modern times everybody has to show and tell everything about themselves (with photos where possible, and video -- even better) but the old school way was not to kiss and tell, and I'm probably in that school, sort of like Bill Clinton -- the spice is there -- but gentlemen don't talk about those things -- I'm not sure why -- it might be something about a reserved zone of joy and respect that can be diluted and cheapened by public exposure -- it's not prudishness though, that's for sure. So having not spoken about the unspeakable, and having kept the obscene off the scene (that is by the way the etymological meaning of the word ob (off) scene (scene)), I feel like Henry Higgins -- how did I talk myself into this corner?

Another is Wordsworth -- the poet of the English Lake District -- and Frost the poet of Massachusetts. The spirituality of the direct contact of man/woman and Nature on Earth is also well displayed in the photos of Ansel Adams, and in the paintings of Vincent Van Gogh and in the songs of Joni Mitchell and of John Denver.    To Jacob Bronowski and to Joseph Campbell Nature had a spiritual value, and to Alan Watts (The Watercourse Way). What is it. Short answer -- it depends on your capacity for meaning -- it depends on who and what you are, and how you are. If you are a farmer -- Hesiod might speak for you and to you. If you are a writer it might be Frost. If you are a scientist it might be Bronowski or Sciama. If you are a shaman it might be Joseph Campbell. If you are a taoist (like Gao Bwo Fu, Juintze -- yours truly) it might be Alan Watts.    Nature is a gift that the living inherit and that they pass on to their children. It is a legacy. It is a stewardship. It brings pleasures and duties. It is a moral touchstone or talisman that tells us who we are and how we think, it is an arena for ethical action and choice. When we are gone it will be the witness that testifies about what we were all about.

In that it is in the nature of Allah, Subhanna wa Ta'ala to, through His love and compassion, to create as an expression of the same and so as to allow His creation the blessing of gaining knowledge of Him for the benefit of the created such is also the spiritual value of nature and all of creation.    In that nature is allowed, even in limited ways, to attain to knowledge of its Creator, it then serves the created  to follow the guidance and revelations of the Creator so as to aspire to be that which the Creator created it so as to enable it to be.

D3rUImGQaa	I'm a Twilight fan and I can say that that was very low of him. Stephenie Meyer may not be the best writer, and Twilight was her 1st novel so you can't expect it to be perfect. She's made her money so I hope what Stephen says won't upset her. Stephen might be a tad bit jealous that his books are not as popular. He thinks he's all that because he writes books about pigs' blood being dumped on one's head...|`|JEP4CmyUaa	Ur wrong, every1 at my school loves it|`|iJzlRCkOaa	And how very right he is!    I'm not wild about Stephen King myself, but he's surely much better than Meyers.  He definitely pointed out the major difference between Meyers and Rowling, too.  While they both write popular books meant mainly for your people (although HP is great for all ages), Rowling is a great author.  Meyers just throws a bunch of random words together.|`|CGcdZpztaa	duudde. ur wrong mannn! twilight is a forever thing dummy ahh. u need to understand we will be bitten and live 4ever!! we win! i will suck ur blood!|`|w3uYxwiraa	AWESOME!

Get out of your box. How do you not know who Stephen King is? He's only been writing for 40 years.    Stephen King has more talent than most people, including Stephenie Meyer.    He's right, SM can't write. JKR can. JK created a whole world, making it extremely realistic. Her books played a huge part in my childhood, and I still love them to this day.    SM inserted a few fantasy characters into our world in a badly written quartet. While the stories are intruguing, her writing style is dreadful.    The Twilight fans need to get out, read some good literature, and come back with their new opinions.

But the fact Stephanie Meyers is able to turn a non-reader into a reader, is a wonderful talent that I believe Mr. King lacks and it bothers him.  She's an okay writer; perhaps a bit elementary for those accustomed to classic literature.  But to say she basically sucks, is terrible.  Writing is an art that takes great patience and skill at any level.|`|xwkVJFf5aa	god. stephen king is a fag. he can die.

To Rosalie: You are the perfect example of why so many people hate the Twilight fanbase:  "Twilight has about 50 million times more supporters that that ugly freak. hes gonna die soon anyways"  Wow, ignorant and rude much? First of all, Stephen King writes books, not movies. There's a bit of a difference there. You haven't read any of his books, so you can't really compare the two authors. You're basing your opinion that King sucks on the premise that he criticized Meyer's writing.

Petrificus Totalis  A spell to cause someone to freeze completely. It seems there are several different spells that cause this same effect :)    Portus  The portus spell creates a portkey that allows people to move from one destination to another easily.    Protego  A spell of protection, to ward off magical attack. Harry uses this at the end of Book 5 to keep a sphere that another is casting "Accio" on.    Reducto  An assault spell, reducto causes damage to what it is fired at. The students use Reducto to blow apart bookshelves at the end of Book 5.    Reparo  A simple spell to repair an object that is broken.    Riddikulus  An anti-boggart spell, that causes the boggart's scary shape-changing ability to be mediated. Mrs. Weasley has trouble with this one at the beginning of Book 5 when a boggart torments her with sights of her family dead.    Scourgify  A cleaning spell, James uses this on Snape when they are young to clean Snape's mouth out with soap.    Silencio  A spell to cause something (or someone) to become silent. As Hermoine instructs Ron, this spell is done with a sharp jab of the wand, not a wave.    Stupefy  This spell should freeze an object in place, but when Umbridge tries to use it on an escapee firework, it explodes instead.    Tarantallegra  A Death eater uses this dance-causing spell on Neville during the final battle in Book 5.

AA10725882	Wiki is the best of several sources I looked at for this. I know that some people do not like Wiki, but it can often be fairly good  From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_C...  "The Roosevelt Corollary was a substantial amendment to the Monroe Doctrine by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. Roosevelt's extension of the Monroe Doctrine asserted the right of the United States to intervene to stabilize the economic affairs of small states in the Caribbean and Central America if they were unable to pay their international debts. The alternative was intervention by European powers, especially Britain and Germany."    Also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_stick_d...  The Big Stick Policy is a form of hegemony.   It was the slogan describing U.S. President Theodore Roosevelts corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. The term originated from the phrase Speak softly and carry a big stick."  The idea of negotiating peacefully, simultaneously threatening with the big stick, or the military, ties in heavily with the idea of Realpolitik (Otto von Bismarck).  It implies an amoral pursuit of political power that resembles the ideals of Machiavelli in his book "The Prince" - written in 1513 and published in 1532.    Added note - "Midge" may have the "three worlds" a bit confused.  The USA is not usually referred to as the "3rd world."|`|10QSTGWAaa	Oh, it's very different.    The Monroe Doctrine states: "First world countries cannot interfere with Third World Countries." (First world: Britain, France, Russia, etc., Third World: USA, etc.)    The Big Stick policy is where we get our Nuke laws from. "Walk softly, but carry a big stick." As in, we'll make weapons to protect ourselves, but until we are provoked into otherwise, they'll remain defensive.    Does that help?

63295742638571c431950adbd7d89edbaa	i like the names, especially the last names. (who would have thought?) not exceedingly unique, but that's not a bad thing at all. it fits together quite well, and if i saw Laurel Prokop or Sara Whipple in a book, i'd pick it up and read. the names are also 'pretty,' but i'd go a step ahead and say they're delightful to mouth (Caleb Foley Caleb Foley Caleb Foley Caleb Foley!!!). not that i'm jumping up and down.   overall? Congratz. you have just made my normally pathetic day awesome. in other words, i like them. then again, i say gesundheit instead of bless you. but they're still awesome to my mind.    a note: THANK YOU SOMEBODY AGREES. not only am i sick of hearing stories of girl drooling over edward just because they leapt onto the bandwagon, it's also a perverse thing to listen to "how brilliant twilight is." it's unrealistic. werewolves? ... meh... and, uh, lemme think, "hot" guys who are perfect? i'm filling up water in my bathtub to go drown myself.     i read twilight. it wasn't dreadful, but since i've read every book in my shelves AT LEAST six times each, it's not sitting in my shelf. or any of the other books. it's okay...but not on my favorite list. thanks for agreeing. lol. and if i've offended anyone...sorry. i just don't like sickeningly romantic stories chock-full of corn (if you get my drift). i prefer stephen king and the authors that are actually good. even jk rowling makes my day with round characters and spectacular jokes.     being seventeen, it's not like i've actually published a book. i'm waiting until i'm officially a legal adult. but even then, i'd love to read it. you don't have to, of course, no pressure. but really, i savor spectacular books, i feel this is one of them. anyway, thanks. that was brilliant.     cheers o.O|`|mqdkcHDFaa	I love the name Laurel. (:  Actually, all the names are terrific.  And I'm more or less your age and I am thrilled to hear that your story doesn't resemble Twilight in any fashion.

b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	I think that make-up is just something that people put on to cover their own imperfections in an endless search for beauty that is propagated by mainstream media and then society as a whole. I don't really care to see much make-up, I feel that it's unnecessary because all works of art have imperfections. Beauty isn't an absence of flaws, it's not an absence of anything, it's a presence of something unique or desirable. More and more nowadays beauty is being seen as rail-thin models and attentiveness to the newest trend. It makes me sad, like seeing a beautiful young woman smoke a cigarette but I understand it's (light) use on occasions.|`|BiWbEMXtaa	makeup is a mask   hiding flaws of one who is insecure.  i wear it, only in the attempt in making myself who I wish I was.|`|FxAD44Moaa	make up is overrated.. eh.|`|fA1XGEnvaa	I would like to be detached from the body altogether; to be attached to the body is foolish as you will have to go through both the pains and pleasures that it undergoes. The body will have to go through decay, disease, and eventually death as old age creeps in. Thus, it is intelligent to of course, properly nourish the body but don't be so attached, so that you will have to suffer in your old age. I am not being pessimistic but just letting you know the reality :)    A person who understands that (1) one day the body will cease existing, and that (2) he himself will not cease existing, naturally becomes less interested in material gain and material pursuits (which he knows will be taken away one day) and becomes more interested in making spiritual advancementadvancement in wisdom, love, and compassion.     I suggest you read books by Eckhart Tolle; listen to his YouTube talks, or even visit his website to start.

38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	I think you need a stronger start than that to hook your reader in.  As it is, I would not continue reading.    A strong beginning is something that would make me go "whoa! I'd better keep reading to find out what this is all about."    There are several errors in the first few paragraphs alone.  You may want to go back and edit before making this public.    It should be "breaking" and not "braking".   "Shining" and not "shinning".  You see, the words are all spelled correctly, but used in the wrong context.  Be careful of that.|`|CGcdZpztaa	i read the first sentence.         publish it! duddddde                       make it a movie!!!      the woods was mysteriously ....

I would say these names are mainly Spanish and Italian or Hispanic in origins.I looked up theses names on ancestry.com under the name origins in the learning center|`|AA11053540	There appears to be some confusion here. People have 2 parents; parents would each have 2 parents, meaning you have 4 grandparents, so there should be only 4 names, not 5.  Next point, names have nothing at all to do with race, or skin color. E.g., a common white man's name is Lee, but Li (usually spelt Lee in America) is common to Chinese! or yellow people.  You can trace the names yourself: try  www.genealogy.about.com/library/surnam...    www.searchforancestors.com/surnames/or...      (You don't need to put "torres" in there)    www.ancestry.com/facts/    www.houseofnames.com    Or, just google whatever surname you want to know about.    I can say, being a senior citizen, and having spent a few years searching for ancestors, quite a few of them being from Spain (and Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Carribean) that all of the names you mentioned are Hispanic, meaning they could have originated in Spain, thus being "white".  Of course, there are millions of black people with Hispanic names, so, it depends upon your own unique circumstances.|`|AA12343309	Spain is a European country and those names are Spanish.  All people with origin in Europe are caucasians.  There are actually no such thing as a "white person."  If they were they would look like Casper the ghost.       Now many people in the U.S. with Spanish names have more of the native people's ancestry  who were in their countries before the conquistadors came than Spanish.  When I was growing up we never had the classification "brown," at least not in my part of Texas.

And I wish there would be a month for Indian people because it was their territory.  And another month for people in India because they have given us so much!  Especially cotton!  Really one black month is not fair at all!  We should have months for other people who helped shape the United States.

FaX8awk1aa	Elijah J. McCoy (May 2, 1843[2]  October 10, 1929) was an African Canadian inventor and engineer, known for his many U.S. patents.    After studying engineering in Edinburgh, Scotland, and returning home to Canada, he found work as a fireman and oiler at the Michigan Central Railroad. In a home-based machine shop in Ypsilanti, McCoy invented an automatic lubricator for oiling the steam engines of locomotives and boats. For this he obtained his first patent, "Improvement in Lubricators for Steam-Engines" (U.S. Patent 129,843 ) on July 23, 1872.    Similar automatic oilers had been patented previously; one is the displacement lubricator which had already attained widespread use and whose technological descendants continued to be widely used into the 20th century. Lubricators were a boon for railroads, allowing trains to run faster and more profitably with less need to stop for lubrication and maintenance.[3]    McCoy continued to refine his devices and design new ones, and after the turn of the century attracted notice among his African-American contemporaries. Booker T. Washington in Story of the Negro (1909) recognized him as having produced more patents than any other black inventor up to that time. This output ultimately propelled McCoy to a heroic status in the African American community which has persisted to this day. He continued to invent until late in life, obtaining as many as 57 patents mostly related to lubrication, but also including a folding ironing board and a lawn sprinkler. Lacking the capital with which to manufacture his lubricators in large numbers, he usually assigned his patent rights to his employers or sold them to investors. Lubricators with the McCoy name were not manufactured until 1920, near the end of his career, when he formed the Elijah McCoy Manufacturing Company. By that time there were several substantial lubricator manufacturers in multiple countries.       First page of US patent 129,843 for Improvement in Lubricators for Steam-EnginesThere is no consensus regarding the importance of McCoy's contribution to the field of lubrication. At one extreme, he is credited in some biographical sketches with revolutionizing the railroad or machine industries with his devices. At the same time, he is scarcely mentioned in the old lubrication literature; for example, his name is absent in E. L. Ahrons' Lubrication of Locomotives (1922) which does refer to several other early pioneers and companies of the field.    According to some sources, the saying the real McCoy, meaning the real thing, derives from Elijah's invention. However this is disputed.[4] The legend is that railroad engineers looking to avoid inferior copies would inquire if a locomotive was fitted with "the real McCoy". This account is disputed as there are other earlier origins to the phrase.[5] Other lubricators were already in widespread use and lubricators with his name were not produced until the 1920's.[6]    McCoy married Ann Elizabeth Stewart in 1868; she died four years later. He remarried the next year to Mary Eleanor Delaney and moved to Detroit. Mary McCoy was one of the founders of the Phillis Wheatley Home for Aged Colored Ladies in 1898.[7]    Elijah McCoy died in Detroit in 1929 at the age of 86, still suffering from injuries from a car accident seven years earlier that killed his second wife. McCoy had been a resident of the Eloise Hospital, a Sanatorium, also known as the Michigan State Asylum (now in Westland, Michigan}, before his death, suffering from dementia.[8]    In 1975, Detroit celebrated Elijah McCoy Day, as officials placed a historic marker at the site of his home. The city also named a street for him.[9]    In 2001, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio.    In 2006, Canadian playwright Andrew Moodie wrote a play called The Real McCoy which chronicles the life of Elijah, his inventions and his personal tragedies until his death.    He is commemorated in other Michigan historical markers. One is at his home, 5720 Lincoln Avenue, Detroit, Michigan at the intersection of Elijah McCoy Drive. Michigan Registry of Historic Sites: P25170. Listed: November 14, 1974 in front of the Elijah McCoy Homes. The other is at his first workshop, in Ypsilanti, Michigan Registered Site S0642 which was erected in 1994.[10]    His remains are interred at Detroit Memorial Park East in Warren, Michigan.[11] This fact is noted on a Michigan Historical Marker.[

ECtW0jx3aa	Descriptive ethics, also known as comparative ethics, is the study of people's beliefs about morality. It contrasts with prescriptive or normative ethics, which is the study of ethical theories that prescribe how people ought to act, and with meta-ethics, which is the study of what ethical terms and theories actually refer to. The following examples of questions that might be considered in each field illustrate the differences between the fields:        Descriptive ethics: What do people think is right?      Normative (prescriptive) ethics: How should people act?      Applied ethics: How do we take moral knowledge and put it into practice?      Meta-ethics: What does 'right' even mean?   Normative ethics is the branch of philosophical ethics that investigates the set of questions that arise when we think about the question how ought one act morally speaking? Normative ethics is distinct from meta-ethics because it examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts. Normative ethics is also distinct from descriptive ethics, as the latter is an empirical investigation of peoples moral beliefs. To put it another way, descriptive ethics would be concerned to determine what proportion of people believe that killing is always wrong while normative ethics is concerned to determine whether it is correct to hold such a belief. Hence, normative ethics is sometimes said to be prescriptive, rather than descriptive. However, on certain versions of the meta-ethical view called moral realism, moral facts are both descriptive and prescriptive at the same time.|`|Wf6UwzCsaa	Descriptive is merely observation for the purpose of collecting data but forming no ethical opinion or overall moral judgment.    Normative uses mean cultural behavior to establish a theory of ethics.|`|yUHh1Q8Qaa	Easy:     Descriptive ethics tells us what a person or group does under, what is considered by the describer, ethical circumstances    Normative ethics tells us what to do when encountering ethical circumstances.|`|d3zT4NFaaa	I think it's best if I answer this question by quoting a famous philosopher (Radley)      Decriptive ethics: The scientific study of moral beliefs and practices, to descibe how people behave and think when dealing with moral issues and arguments.    Normative ethics: The study of principles, rules, or theories that guide our actions and judgements, To determine what actually is morally right or wrong.    Another way to look at it is the distinction between meta-ethics and applied ethics. A fine example of this is the discipline of "neuro-ethics" which encompasses both streams.

6TPEyJqhaa	The Treaty was less about making peace and more about punishing Germany.  It lead to the conditions that brought dictators to power.  Hitler was one of them, of coarse, but also Mussolini in Italy and Stalin in the Soviet Union.  And having 1 person in complete control over a country in always dangerous.  The treaty also failed to end Imperialism, which was one of the causes of WW1, because the treaty didn't make the all countries give up their colonies.  If you think about it WW2 is just a continuation of WW1 once a new generation was old enough to fight (about 20 years apart).|`|YupMCYHlaa	The allies forced this really nasty treaty down the Germans' throats at the end of WWII.  Germans had to pay enormous amounts in reparations. The French wanted some of the territories that Germany and France had been fighting over for years.  And there were many other restrictions on Germany.    So during the 20s, the post war period, when the rest of the world was having good times, a big financial boom, Germany was suffering a recession.  And when the Great Depression hit, Germany really got the worst of it--hyperinflation, terrible unemployment and hopelessness.    So the German people were ready to fall in line behind a charismatic leader who promised to put Germany on top again, who told them that Germans really should run things all over the world because they were better people--smarter, stronger, etc.    Also, though for some reason you don't read this in many history books, the real reason for WWI was imperialism.  All the major countries were building colonies in Africa, the Far East, and elsewhere.  Germany wanted its share.  WWII was a continuation of that fight, with Germany marching into countries and taking them over, third world countries as well as much of Europe.|`|Mb31azhQaa	made peace, yet took away land from germans who felt cheated by the plan, so they just rebelled and hitlers help got them to fight, for vengeance

Do your best which is all anyone wants from you anyway.|`|draNVjbkaa	Here's the cliffsnote version of Method Acting:   I'm sure you're familiar with Method Acting. Method Acting comes from Stanislavski. In the U.S., there are three main versions of American Method, Strasberg, Adler, and Meisner.     Strasberg was an advocate of what's called affective memory and substitution. This is using past emotions or your own experiences to generate current emotions. Some famous people who studied this version of Method were/are James Dean, Marilynn Monroe, Al Pacino, Paul Newman.     Stella Adler (Stanislavski disciple who studied alongside Strasberg) went to Europe to study with Stanislavski, himself. Stanislavski was originally an advocate of affective memory and substitution, but he realized that it was flawed. Over time, a memory can change. For example a memory that was once traumatic as a kid is now a silly memory. Stella went back to the U.S. and said Strasberg was wrong and formed her branch of American Method. Her version focuses more on imagination and doesn't use affective memory or substitution. Robert DeNiro , Bennicio del Toro, and Marlon Brando were from this school.     Sanford Meisner (another Stanislavski disciple along Strassberg and Adler) also wasn't a fan affective memory and substitution so he formed his own version of American Method. His version focuses more on instincts and reacting to the moment. He defined acting as "living in imaginary cirumstances." Some people who use Meisner are/were Gregory Peck, Robert Duvall, Steven McQueen, Jon Voight, Jeff Goldblum, just to name a few.     Here's some good books to check out:   -A Dream of Passion-Lee Strasberg   -Art of Acting-Stella Adler   -Sanford Meisner on Acting-Sanford Meisner     In addition to their books, here are some other good books to check out:   For a good book about all three of the Methods:   -The Unconscious Actor- Darryl Hickman     Additional reading on Meisner:   -Actor's Art and Craft-William Esper     Additional reading on Strasberg:   -Strasberg's Method-Lorraine Hull    Study all three major branches and find out which ones are for you. I'm an Adler and Meisner guy with regards to Method Acting. I didn't have a messed up childhood and nor am I introspective enough to use Strasberg. J/K!

These examples are relaxed, easy to play, and very easy to add complex little extras between your phrases. You shouldn't play a single melodic riff as I imagine if you're telling a story you're going to be alone. You need chords to give yourself a solid background. Hope this helps.

7EqpPkvpaa	Home from Beauty and the Beast is a good fit, especially if you can belt. It doesn't have to be belted though. Its range is A3 (A below middle C) to F5 (the last line on the staff.) If you buy it online and print it off, you can adjust the key before you buy it. That way, if you want it higher, just move it up and visa versa. Any Christine song from Phantom of the Opera is high as well but not for the whole song. Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again is a good one. How Lovely to Be a Woman from Bye Bye Birdie will fit the style of Guys and Dolls well.

21Lnhdfeaa	If you want to know which SERIES is better, Lord of the Rings should not be in the list.  It's neither a series nor a trilogy.  It's ONE book.  It's broken into three main parts, but it's only one book.  The easiest way to tell is this:  You can pick up any of the Narnia, Potter or Twilight series in any order, and the books can stand alone.  But you can't do that with Lord of the Rings.  You can't just read Two Towers and know what's going on in the story.      Having said that, of the Series listed, I'd have to say that Potter is the best series.  If you're wondering which literary work is the best, that's Lord of the Rings, without contest or competition.  The only one that even comes close to the drama of Lord of the Rings and the literary prowess is Narnia.  However, even that doesn't come close.      To compare these great literary works to Twilight is downright insulting to anyone with half a brain.|`|cHxaWW0taa	Movies - Lord of the Rings    Books - Harry Potter|`|vyfkyYvVaa	LotR all the way, for both! (But I also adore Narnia, and Harry Potter. Rawr..your making me pick between three of my favorites ^_^)|`|Taf5yWUbaa	Harry Potter.|`|MSEyXHFWaa	For Na-nee-ah!    For movies it's got to be the Lord of the Rings.   The movies were just epic. I loved the CGI and the battle scenes and everything was just so well done.    For books I'd go with Harry Potter just because it was the most entertaining to read.    Movies:  1 LOTR  2 Harry Potter  3 Twilight  4 Narnia. I'm sorry, but Narnia played like a childish Lord of the Rings. When Peter (I think) yelled out "For Narnia" I burst out laughing. And no blood in an epic battle scene? No death in an epic battle scene? Give me a break. This should have been a cartoon.    Books:  1 Harry Potter  2 Lord of the Rings. This gets  2 because it created the modern fantasy genre.  3-4 Narnia & Twilight. I didn't really care for either, but they were okay in their own rights. Twilight is here for a want of a plot and Narnia gets the place for shamelessly and brazenly stealing its plot from the Jesus story.|`|86oPkfzOaa	I didn't read narnia or lord of the rings.

The series was brilliant to begin with; after all these many years after its first publication, it's still popular and loved by the widest age range. The movies were nearly just as captivating as Rowling's words, and, not to mention, it stayed true to the book (at least for the first few).|`|JnSrN3guaa	ilove all the movies ('specially twilight), 'cept lord of the rings -- never read it. but iloved them all.  for the series, i'll choose twilight, then harry potter -- i'm soon going to read narnia -- and not so much lord of the rings.

All these books provide differen styles of writing. Tolkien and Rowling are more advanced in writing compared to Meyer, but the stories are equally excellent. As far as picking a favorite for all age types, I'd pick Harry Potter, anyoone can read it and enjoy it. Lord of the Rings- not everyone would follow through with the whole story, and Twilight- Well... anyone could have came up with a storyline like that; Vampire boy falls in love with human girl.  Harry Potter provides all aspects of adventure, love, and heroic binds between the protagonist and main motive.|`|d32r2HESaa	The Lord of the Rings were the best on both counts in my opinion, followed by Narnia and then Twilight.

FUSqK1uEaa	With your thoughts.Thoughts are things.Picture yourself with the perfect body and truly believe in it.You can look at yourself in the mirror and see and feel the changes you want.    Some people may think that's bullshit but to be honest with you that is what I have been doing for the past two years and it worked better than anything else I could have tried..to the point that there isn't a part of my body that I dislike anymore.    I believe everything in the world is energy..nature,others,yourself.And that thoughts have frequencies that can make manifestations in the physical world.Therefore if you focus on physical features you want to change in yourself it will.You can exercise and look at yourself in the mirror before going to bed and just focus on the changes you want.     Hope that helped. :)|`|oY9jks5faa	Law of Attraction consists of four steps:    1. Know exactly what you want- In this case, a perfect body.    2. Ask the universe for it- In other words, pray to God that your body will automatically mutate into a perfect specimen of a man. Even though you've been naughty all your life, and your intentions are to use your "new body" to attract girls, so that you can do even more naughty things to them. *Lol.*    3. Feel, behave and know as if the object of your desire is on its way- Tell everybody and everyone else around you that your body is slowly becoming more lean and muscular (Even while still eating junk food and spending your waking hours in front of your computer playing World of Warcraft). AKA: Wishful thinking.    4. Be open to receive it and let go of (the attachment to) the outcome- Realise that your goal is unrealistic and that you'll never be lean and buff, and give just up.    JUST KIDDING! Actually, the truth is: The Law of Attraction is total BS! (Accept the praying to God bit, that usually works).    NOW, SERIOUSLY, if you want a better body, the solution is easy: put yourself on a program for a couple weeks where you eat less carbs and eat more meat and vegies, portion your food so that you don't put on fat, and exercise for 10-15 minutes a day.     Good luck, I hope you get your new body.|`|g3DdvMAFaa	Don't you mean attain?     Or are you talking about cadavers?

Then I work out to the characters involved, and how they reached the climax. Then as I write, the characters seem to take on personalities of their own - they never finish the way they started. But the weirdest thing when I'm writing is that i come up with plot twists out of nowhere that always manage to explain what was happening in the earlier chapters. can't explain it; it must be something my subconscious works out while I'm writing :P|`|5e0755e06d5f4f1b24b497cc9427c910aa	I just write a whole bunch of crap, and then TELL people it's excellent.

My suggestion, you are trying too hard to come up with something original and excellent... you won't come up with many trust me.     Look at your life and be inspired by everyday events.     My short film/screenplay entitled "11 minutes Bus Ride" - summary: a boy rides the bus for an 11 minute ride on the bus. He gets bored so along the way, he imagines what other people are thinking. People included businessman, an old man looking at a younger female.     It was inspired by my own journey everyday on the bus. I get bored and ideas came to me.. what other people might do if they are bored.

Well, I figure there is about a 50/50 chance of a supreme diety, and 50% we are the result of random chance.    If it is the latter, then obviously nothing is for a reason. End of story.    If, however, we have been placed here by the Christian   diety(s), then 'free will' is a pivotal component. As such, 'reasons' would be contrary to  the intent. Ergo, No.    I suspect this is true of most 'one life to live' religions.    If we have been placed by the Hindu Dieties, the whole point of the wheel of life is for us to learn to ascend the karmic ladder. As such, 'learning' can only come if we have the free will to fail. Thus, even though we are here live to role we have attained (or descended to) anything other then free will would be contrary to intent., Thus, no.    Pretty much the same thing extends to all the major religions that use the reincarnation model, to one degree or another.    At the other extreme, you have the determinists, people who believe all of our actions have been predetermined, and we are nothing more then the cogs in a machine. As such, we have as much 'purpose' as a ball bearing, but we really have no 'reason', as there is no choice in what we do.    Did I miss anything?|`|3oxiRLS2aa	think of life as a big movie, we are all actors in it|`|7OMNMm33aa	Yes. People change your life no matter how small it may seem. The cashier lady at McDonald's tells you to have good day and you end up having a good day. The teacher who tells you, "You CAN do it," actually convinces you, you can. The random people who do random things that make you happy.    Or the random people who make you feel sad. The person ho doesn't smile back when you smile at them. The person who convinces you it's all your fault. These people change your life and they are meant to.     Think about the people you've met and what they've done for you. Maybe they've taught you something about yourself or maybe they've showed you what not to do with your life, and that also helps you.    People are meant to help each other and I think your life is planned based on your personality and God knows you and knows what kind of people can help you, so you can help others, so they can help others, so they can help others....(and so on).

It is like mirroring. ''We project onto others our perceptions of their motivations, and what we believe is good for them to do or not do.     When we feel resistance to someone, we can ask ourselves what the characteristics are of that person. What kind of person are they? What words could be used to describe them? Then, we can ask ourselves whether those words could be used to describe us, and we might feel a bit embarrassed to discover that in fact, we remember situations where those words would certainly describe us.''    When we realize what we don't like about others and that it is telling us something about ourselves, it shows us what we need to improve on, and we are shown the way. Or we may like something about the way they are, which can either show that we have the same quality as them, or would like to acquire that quality - in this case they are an example to follow.|`|gTfI9wmuaa	Yes,  You know if it has ever happened to you.

A lady in my church that I am able to help, Pa-.  It is my pleasure, and it keeps my mind off of my own problems.      There are so many more, but I do not wish to bore you.

One of the reasons is that people act as mirrors, reflecting back to us our good and bad aspects. If you know someone who consistently annoys you with a behavior, that's a big red flag - chances are you are doing that same behavior to someone else. In the same way, people reflect our goodnesses back to us.   Another reason people are placed in our lives is to teach us; most everyone can name someone in their lives who set an awesome example to follow.   And all people are placed in our lives to give us the chance to express Love!|`|xO2oXQzpaa	Everything that happens to to u is put in front of you for a reason, whether it be good or bad,I believe no matter what the situation is at least try to make the best of it.

MlZay5VHaa	I'd choose Jacob because Edward's big mistake is overreaction. It's in his nature to be too extreme. He's a very all-or-nothing kind of person, and it makes him unreasonable. In the beginning of Eclipse, he's too overprotective. When he sees the error of his ways, he goes too far in the other direction. He could have chosen a middle groundmaybe admitted to his jealousy and asked Bella to choose him, rather than watching her get in deeper with Jacob. Of course, he has other issues that make forcing this issue problematic. What if Jacob is better for her? What if Bella could have a more complete life with him? Should Edward really insist that Bella give everything up for vampire life? Or would it be better to let her make a fully informed choice? Can you see his dilemma? Part of Edward wants Bella to choose Jacob.    Jacob doesn't have a tragic flaw. He has one goal and one hope. His goal is to save Bella's life. His hope is that he'll win her heart in the process. He fails at both. But that doesn't mean he regrets trying. If he could do it over again, he'd do the same thing. Jacob couldn't live with himself if he didn't give saving Bella his best efforthe knows it's going to hurt when he loses, but he knows it would hurt worse if he didn't try. Does he do everything right? Heck, no! But he's sixteen and he's making it up as he goes along. Those who are upset by some of his tactics should consider his youth and the fact that he is, after all, right. Bella is in love with him. (In the end, it's truly healthier for her to be aware of this as she goes forward with unalterable decisions.) Also, I like Jacob because he doesn't baby Bella like Edward does. Jacob knows that Bella is capable of handling dangerous situations. I wouldn't want my boyfriend treating me like a helpless kid would you?    Oh I almost forgot. There is a downside to choosing Jacob. If Bella chose Jacob instead of Edward, she would always have to worry about Jacob imprinting later on. What if he did imprint on someone else? Even though Jacob said that if he did imprint he wouldn't leave Bella, if he did end up imprinting, he would have no choice but to do just that: leave Bella. It happened to Sam. What makes you think that Jacob's situation would be different?    Edward manipulated Bella into marrying him. You should NOT get married unless it is something that you wholeheartedly want to do. Edward knows that she doesn't want to get married, but he uses sex as a bargaining tool to get her to marry him! Jake is also a bit manipulative. He manipulated Bella into asking him to kiss her, but this is good for her in the end because she accepts the fact that she loves him.  Edward is way too controlling over Bella. He dismantles her car and forcefully prevents her from visiting Jake and he makes his sister kidnap her. Jacob always gives Bella a choice in every matter and he never forces her to do anything (except kiss him lol which is pretty bad.)  Edward is WAY too overprotective. He never gives Bella any space and he always has to be her eyes and her brain and her hands and her legs...you get my point. He never lets Bella solve her own problems, while Jacob lets Bella have fun and take risks.  Edward doesn't care about those around him. Like in New Moon when he decides to pull a Romeo and kill himself. He knows that his death will devastate his family, yet he attempts to get himself killed anyway. Jacob cares for his family. He takes care of his Dad all the time and he would never abandon him for a long period of time (he left once but only for a little while).    ****BREAKING DAWN SPOILER BELOW****      A lot of people say they hate Jake because he imprinted of Renesmee, and I have to come to Jacob's defense here. First of all, it's not his fault that he imprinted on a child. A werewolf never gets to choose who he imprints on. Take Sam for example. He loved Leah before he loved Emily. If he had the ability to choose to imprint on someone, he would've chosen Leah long before Emily came into the picture. Secondly, imprinting on a child doesn't mean that Jacob is attracted to that child in a romantic or a sexual way. It just means that he wants with all his heart to protect that child and to make her happy....like a really loving big brother. Jacob won't have any romantic feelings towards Renesmee for a VERY long time. Meyer clearly states this in New Moon and on her website.|`|0tXcfq0waa	Mainly Team Edward but I still like Team Jacob just as much.|`|0WKkXIyKaa	no|`|zrStxob6aa	ohmygosh team jacob.  all the way.  especially because i loveee taylor lautner and dont really like r.p. lol but in the books too i'm jacob all the way =P|`|If2ww2i9aa	Jakeward!!!

r9s0VyJgaa	I may be wrong about this, but I was under the impression that the term "A & R person" refers to someone who works for a particular record label, whose job is to be the liaison between the artists and the record company.    A manager or agent would charge you a commission plus expenses for negotiating a record deal for you.  That sounds legit.  But a manager or agent would also book live gigs for you to perform at, schedule your tour itineraries, handle your business affairs, deal with lawyers and accountants on your behalf, make sure your business-related expenses are paid, etc -- and for all these services, they would make a percentage commission on everything you make, not just the record company advance.

lIRCcWpSaa	In a two party system like the US and UK there is no way either party can be weakened, the third party candidates are used mainly as protest votes against the governing party, and the main opposition. Particularly in the US, the party structure virtually prohibits any form of third party from ever having influence in government. In the UK, the third party is sometimes useful when either of the two parties has a very small majority and wants to assure itself of becoming the next government. However, even then the third party never has a big influence, only given posts which have little power and/or influence.    Third party choices always exist, but with their prospects bleak people rarely consider them a serious choice as becoming a party of power.|`|Dz0Z3Aogaa	It would be even better if we banned Republicans.  Why allow Americans choices as all?  Don't we want to fix this country?  Then we need to do away with all the minor parties because there are not enough people to support them.

More parties would be good.    Choice is certainly a reason - I for one don't believe there are only two school of political thought.    But maybe even more importantly is the fact that a two party system instills an us-vs-them mentality in congress.  If neither party had a majority, they'd have to form alliances with other parties to pass legislation.  That would constantly force teamwork and original ideas - instead we have this cycle where the controlling party bullies the other until they get voted out.    Canada and the UK have more 3rd party representation than the US, and I think it's healthy.  Germany, France, India, and Israel are true multi party systems.  I won't pretend to be an expert on their politics, but AFAIK they move a little smother.|`|qDSvOOwBaa	I'm about as far from a politician as you can get but I believe this would upset the function of the electoral college.

He has a section where he talks about dairy and how pasteurized foods are stripped of their nutrients. Dairy products are heavily processed. Laird suggests only eating unpasteurized or raw dairy products. Which I am doing.  I also tried the core work-out and I like it.    He makes it clear, that not only is it possible to thrive in the modern world without adopting its harmful habits: it's essential. And not only has Hamilton mastered this balance, he makes a compelling and articulate case that anyone who wants to can do the same

MSEyXHFWaa	Do you mean the past/present tense or past/present events?    If it's events, I would have to say both. Write selectively from the events that you thought defined your high school experience, but don't forget about the more recent ones.     If your school had a minor zombie outbreak which led to the installation of practice zombie drills which led to you and your class spending the lunch hour locked inside the school's panic room, then you'd better include the zombie outbreak in your book.    Your book should be written about the defining experiences about your high school years. Include both past and present events.    If you mean tense, then I'd recommend past tense. I just like it more.    EDIT:  Oh.  I think that you hould continue writing from where you left off while keeping a journal of current events to help you out when you advance your story. For an autobiography, I don't think that flashbacks would work very well and it would be best to tell things in the order that they happened.     That said, if you really know your stuff you can write things from the present view and include stories about the past as you write.     I think, however, that your best option would be to continue the story from where you left off while making notes about the present so that you have something to work off of when your story catches up with them.|`|yOK32PM9aa	I agree with the other answers, but it occurs to me that you might mean chronologically - Is it better to start the book with the past and work forwards in time; or to start with the present , and reveal the past in "flashbacks"?    If so, you ought to experiment.  There are some excellent books which play around with time and reveal the present through the past.  Huxley's "Eyeless in Gaza", and Rose MacAuley's "The Towers of Trebizond", for example.  Try writing both, and go with the one that makes most sense to you.|`|dXW9cPWMaa	You mean, writing in the past or present tense? Honestly, it's a matter of what you feel more comfortable with and what sounds better in the story.    I'm writing a novel-length manuscript about people a few years older than I but I'm writing it in the present tense because I tried to write it in the past and the depth I wanted to imply just wasn't there. It allows for more spur-of-the-moment action, which is more important for me.    EDIT  I agree with OnTheOrigin. If I were you, I would continue writing from where you left off, but create an outline so that you don't forget anything you want to put in. It doesn't have to be a bare-bones outline, either - you can put in more details, characters, and anything that happens.    I would warn you against writing about people you know. If you put this out and they read it, they could sue you for slander if they feel they were improperly represented. Just something to think about. I think it's great to write a memoir of your high school days, but you might want to save it as research and write your own unrelated story, using your experiences as background, unless you're going to write it so that they won't sue you. It's a fine line.

I would concentrate on acting instead. Even small towns have school plays and community theaters so get involved with as many as you can.  Build up your experience before trying a big city like Atlanta. Then start looking at colleges with great Theater/Film schools to continue your studies. Your school counselor should help you on this.

a9wRfuuSaa	If you just want action, try any of the books by Matthew Reilly. His books have non-stop action from cover to cover. Start with Ice Station or Seven Deadly Wonders, the first books in each of their series. I can guarantee the pace of action won't allow you to put the book down.    I also enjoyed the books by Tom Clancy, particularly his earlier ones. The most action packed would be Red Storm Rising, The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger and Rainbow Six. They are full of military action and political intrigue, and should keep you turning pages as well.     Try some of the thrillers by Dean Koontz, such as The Husband, The Good Guy, Watchers and Life Expectancy. Although not really action books, there is some action and the pace of the story will keep you involved.     You might also consider some of the books of Clive Cussler, James Rollins, Dan Brown, Steve Berry, Douglas Preston, Lincoln Child and Robert Ludlum|`|w3uYxwiraa	The Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini  The Maximum Ride books by James Patterson  Midnight for Charlie Bone (and the rest of the Children of the Red King series)  The Lord of the Rings books  Mort by Terry Pratchett|`|BNBKVpz2aa	I would Say The Hobbit by J.R.R tolkien.

MZagCrTSaa	You basically just took the words right out of my mouth.  Those books were nothing but utter garbage.  I found myself cringing in some bits over Edward's obsessive behaviour.|`|uhHfm3Azaa	i see where youre coming from, definatley, though i don't completely agree.  edward is just that- edward. he thinks of bella as incredibly breakable and as if she needs protection all the time. and to top it all off, he's madly in love with her.  plus, i've never looked at it as just love. thet, like, need each other. they are part of each others physical make-up.  new moon:  i'm sorry- yes, im a dork, but, it made me cry through out the whole book, and i've never even met edward. and like i said above, they totally are reliant and dependant on each other. what if your left side just split off from your right side and left for seven months? you'd be in pain too. i liked new moon though. it intensified their relationship even further. and the last 120+ pages completely made up for edward's disappearance.   eclipse:  ok, so like i was saying. you just get the love of your existence back after being manic depressive and in pain for half a year. i wouldn't want him/her out of my sight either. edward did go a little overboard, but when your with a vampire, your relationship is bound to be a little more intense than if your with mike newton. and bella feels a connection and a responsibility to be there for jake, like he was there for her.    breaking dawn:  I KNOW!  i did not want them to have a kid. especially a mutant spawn child. and then, to add, edward was miserable which makes me sad. (it's like being in his mind, having to think that it's your fault your "fate" or "destiny" (take your choice) is dying and you can't help her... :( ) and yeah, imprinting creeps me the hell out. there were good parts, but overall, it wasnt my favorite one in the saga, by far.    still, im a complete twilighter and obsessed and just love them. :)      ...and i wasn't planning on writing a novel for an answer. sorry :)|`|cX6POKeHaa	have you put yourself in Bella's shoes?|`|810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	I don't think Stephenie Meyer would have written him any other way.

dUwPlfHnaa	umm what  book is this youre talking about lol|`|R5UIMBvcaa	The most memorable part of Book VI is the brief meeting between Hector and Andromache, which definitely shows the negative side of war.  Andromache has lost all her family to the wat that is now in its ninth year, and she begs Hector to stay in the city so that she won't lose him, too.  Obviously he has little freedom to do what she asks, although he foresees the end of Troy, with Andromache a slave in some Greek household.  It's fairly clear that, unlike the Achaeans and some of the allies of Troy, Hector is not fighting for personal glory but in defense of his country, which has been invaded because his brother committed an act that Hector himself wouldn't think of committing..    Before this incident, however, Hector has (1) given his mother his brother Helenus' message that she should offer her best dress to Athena and pray for deliverance from Diomedes (which she does in vain) and (2) virtually dragged Paris out of bed with Helen and prodded him to return to battle.  He doesn't explicitly say, but the reader is quite aware, that it's Paris's war that they're fighting.     So while most of the Iliad hits us with the blood and brutality of war, Book VI shows us the injustice and pathos. Then as now, we need to be reminded of the devastating effect of war on innocent civilians.
AA11678263	I think in order for the two to become romantically attached, something needs to happen to throw them together - some sort of tragedy or event that makes them see each other a little differently and compromise a little on their lifestyles.  They are both definite characters, and I believe you will develop them both well.  If you want to write a typical romance, maybe try reading a few romantic books to identify the chain of events or the shape of the plot lines.  Or you could have them form an intense relationship as a consequence of an outside event, and focus on that, with their relationship a steady aside?    Either way, good luck and keep writing =o)|`|qXTWnEzEaa	First, there's a small typo in the summary.    'Their' needs to be changed to 'They're'.     If you wish to involve romance between Ludwig and Valerie, first she has to start hating him, being very frustrated by him. This is a cliche, but the way they are opposites and Ludwig is very strange, it is easier to write this into the story rather than a different cliche.    However, I must warn you, Ludwig is (at the beginning) a little TOO strange to have Valerie start to love him. There's two ways you can change this: 1. Re-write the first chapter so he is less unusual (though still eccentric, like you wish). 2. Have a slight change in him that involves him being very sweet to Valerie (perhaps in a way that makes Valerie feel sorry for him).    This is a cliche, I know, but what you have to realise is that when writing romance, you cannot steer clear of a cliche. Almost every means of falling in love in literature IS a cliche, so it is best to start with two unusual characters, as you have done.     Other than that, I think it will be a very promising story, and I hope to read more of it some day soon (perhaps from a library...?)    Good luck.

1l69CCScaa	I don't understand what you mean by research but I think I can answer some of your other questions.  I'll do it part by part.    "Did many people write it- like disciples or something?"    Yes!  Besides the gospels of the New Testament, which are supposedly written by the apostles (Jesus' main followers), the Old Testament was written by many authors, most of which we don't know.  For example, most biblical scholars agree that Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 were written by different people.  Why?  They have very different writing styles and even refer to God by different names.      It's important to distinguish the New and Old Testaments because they were written by different people for different purposes.  The Old Testament was written as a history of the Israelite people and God's role in shaping their history.  The New Testament is a collection of gospels - different accounts of Jesus' life by his followers.  Some of the writings describe the same event in different way or with different details so it's important, when describing an event in Jesus' life, to say which gospel it's from.    "What is the Bible- is there just one...?"   Yes... and no.  The Bible is a compilation of many different writings, most claiming to be first-hand accounts in the New Testament and general descriptions in the Old Testament.  The original Hebrew bible has been translated into a couple versions (like the King James version, which you've probably heard of).  However, not all Bible's are just translations.  At the council of Nicaea (325 AD) the Bible was amended and certain gospels were removed.  These are known as the apocrypha and are only in certain bibles.      Even sect of Christianity thinks they have the right version.  Some use the most up-to-date translation from the Hebrew in an attempt to preach in English whilst still remaining as accurate as possible.  Others use the King James version, saying that because that is how it reached them first it must be the true word.  Justifications vary, but they're all derived from the same texts.    "well maybe if you can just provide me with a very brief overview please"    Sure!  The ancient Israelites believed that the primary role of God was to direct history.  A number of times he directly intervened (story of Moses) while at other times he just inspired certain events.  The history of the Israelites is recorded in the Old Testament, also known as the Talmud, and is the Jewish holy text.  They see all prophets as merely prophets and don't accept Jesus to be anything more than a man - not the son of God.      0 AD - Jesus is born.  While traveling around, preaching, Jesus collects about a dozen followers called Apostles.  These guys follow Jesus everywhere and even record his death.  The accounts of these guys are called the Gospels.  I believe most of them have some writing attributed to them although as I said before not all of them are always included.  For example, the Gospel of Thomas is merely a collection of sayings and aphorisms attributed to Jesus.      Bear in mind though that through careful analysis and dating of these records most are not from the time they're attributed to.  Others are just copies of supposed originals, like the Gospel of Thomas.        If you have any other questions send me a personal message and I'll be happy to answer them.  I'm not great authority on the Bible but I find it fascinating as a historical piece of writing and an object of immense cultural value.|`|AA11564934	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible|`|zBpj9jCfaa	The bible was written by a bunch of stuffy, old, power-hungry men in an effort to destroy the religion (paganism) of millions upon millions of people so that they could take over the world and destroy everyone's lives.     the end.|`|OQb533GPaa	The Catholics compiled the new testament.  The early church fathers wrote based on the teachings of Jesus and the apostles.      Later on Protestants came along and decided to edit what they thought should or shouldn't be in the bible.  (that's where you get the King James Version etc).    My eloquence isn't that great when it comes to talking about history and religion, however one of the best speakers on the subject I've heard is John Martignoni.  Might want to do some research here:  http://www.biblechristiansociety.com/    If you truely are interested in the subject, purchase his CD set Bible answers for Fundamentalist Questions.  It is fantastic!  It's about $30 but well worth the listen.  https://www.guardianangelstore.com/modul...

But when they come together and work as one...!      They're still very much stoppable.

oXIYHsDaaa	My favourite is the 2" brass pole from Aradia fitness, but it really depends on what you are looking for. If you want to be able to do a lot of high level moves where you hang upside down then you want to go with a brass pole that is either permanently mounted or is not spring loaded and is tightened with a wrench. Stainless steel poles give you less grip because unlike brass stainless steel can not absorb any of the oils from you hands. If you're not needing it to be that sturdy then You can go with a pressure mounted on that you tighten by hand, just make sure it has some sort of threading inside so you can tighten it well. Also if you rent your home you may want to go with a little minx pole because they are height adjustable from 8-10 feet (or 7-9 feet if you special order it that way) but the Little minx requires a ceiling mount and I've had them slide out even when the mount is used and one mount I had actually broke so always check the pole before you use it and after every 15 minutes or so of continued use. Also stainless steel required less maintenance, you just use a little windex to shine it up, where as brass needs to be polished with metal polish.  You will pay between $250 and $300 for a good pole, the cheaper ones are just that, cheap and that's not real safe especially if you want to do inverts or fast spins.|`|4z2L9PTLaa	Well, I don't know where you live, but this past Christmas, I told my parents that I wanted to be a stripper when I got older, so they went to a store called Jokers, and bought me a pole for Christmas! So, conclusion, if there is a nearby Jokers where you live, they will most definately have one. Also, if you have a Sunset Novelties, they might also have one!    Hope I helped, [:
DvToP5h7aa	There are a number of techniques, devices and conventions common to a great deal of Gothic literature:    http://www.heckgrammar.kirklees.sch.uk/i...|`|kIJ09aeaaa	Sounds like you haven't read it. It is a short story by Ambrose Bierce and was the basis for an old Twilight Zone Episode.  I don't remember it well, but basically it takes place during the US civil war, and  the protagonist is going to be hung.  The rope breaks and he tries to escape, the story is about the chase as he desperately tries to get away.  Then at the end it turns out it was all in his mind, while he was waiting for the floor to drop.  He ends up getting hung.|`|1xggHtgXaa	I'm not sure about the gothic part, but it definitely isn't a novel; it's a short story. :)
ugiUyhOwaa	Love is cheesy when.....  ?the characters who are in love in the story achieved a happy ending without any struggle (in short, unrealistic).  ?the characters who are in love in the story became unaware of their surroundings because they spend too much time together.      Love seem right when.....  ?the characters struggle for it (sacrificing is a must)  ?there is a certain spark that lights up between the two characters      Declaration of love becomes cheesy when.....  ?Yes, when a guy cries.  ?there is no any peculiar about it|`|yOK32PM9aa	I think it appears cheesy if it conforms to a cliche; if it has obviously been done that way before.  We avoid cliche by being creative, and coming up with new appropriate ways to say what we mean.  The same applies to all art.  The same applies to a real declaration of love.  Would you prefer to be given a red rose (cliche!) or a flower that your beloved had secretly discovered to be your favourite?|`|AA11703549	That's a really good question.|`|ZXdnxIrFaa	any cliche that is trying to sound new would make any type of novel cheesy.    Actually given all these answers, i can name a few people who are now in such relationships as defined in those answers. I just sit and watch and shake my head at them, try to warn them, but soon enough things will crash before them.|`|DwLCTjTFaa	Easy.    Cheesy love is *too* perfect.  They rarely fight, and when they do it's about mundane things.  They're both hot, they "complete" each other, etc.  Barf!    The right stuff is when both are forced to accept each other in spite of their respective flaws.  They're irrational, blinded by their own views and passions, there are gross misunderstandings etc.  Doesn't get any more real than that.    Hence, Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.  Imperfect people, perfect for each other.    And if i read one more book where the male is the only one who has to go through a mental struggle in order to succumb to commitment, while the female lead waits patiently to be pursued and captured, I'm going to scream.|`|HGMCvkc9aa	when everything the two characters say or do is clich.|`|XLRx5decaa	I'll do my best to list reasons:  -when the guy cries  -when the guy makes the girl his whole life and the girl makes the guy her whole life  -when the guy babies the girl... etc.    This question was harder to answer than I thought...|`|R0iHHPqEaa	everything
afikdpZoaa	The arrival of the Spanish brought the horse, which did not exist in the Americas.  Many horses escaped over the years and ran wild.  When the Plains Indians learned to catch and ride them, it made the Buffalo hunt much more efficient and brought a "golden age" to these Indians.    But if you mean, the actual arrival of Europeans on the Plains, this did not really change the lives of the Indians all that much -- until gold was found in the Black Hills of Dakota.      The Indians absolutely would not allow the Earth to be desecrated by mining, so they had to be eliminated.  That is when they were forced onto reservations and the Buffalo were almost completely annihilated so that the Indians would have no source of food if they left the reservations.  Sucked pretty bad.
Y5jv0ybFaa	InstructionsDifficulty: Easy   Step1Make room. Clear a space for everyone to dance with the music. Move coffee tables and clear off rugs that may hinder dancing or bunch up. If you have a hard wood or tiled floor it is best to wear socks to allow for proper foot sliding when you do the twist.   Step2Play the right music. Choose Motown or 50's bop tunes to play. Make sure you have an entire album or compilation of songs that give you enough time to really get everyone to join in this dance. If you want to switch it up, place a few discs in the player at a time and use a remote control to switch from disc to disc.   Step3Twist the night away. Have everyone stand in a spot big enough for movement. Stand with your feet hip width apart and feel the rhythm of the music. Twist your hips from side to side as you move one foot out to help with the motion. Switch feet as needed to move around a lot. To get the feet right, just act like you are trying to squash a bug on the floor and grind it into the floor.   Step4Use your hands. Clap your hands or do a toweling motion with your arms as though you have a towel in your hands and are drying off your posterior. You can also mix it up with moving up and then down with the twist. When you do the twist right, it is fun, easy, and can be changed up as you feel necessary to create a more unique dance.|`|Eg0WqKmBaa	look it up on youtube.  just search for 'the twist'  enjoy!|`|F5R3TJEQaa	swerve and drip|`|wNvhIUi2aa	move|`|ei0Wryytaa	you lift your arm in front of you like claw, then you bend your left leg back    that's called the scorpion|`|ee4c731e172709155a7a44c4d836eaa4aa	Check it out on YouTube.com -- there should be lots of examples listed there for you.|`|21m13Zo8aa	mmm|`|N84a3Ei4aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGAUTADn4...
pkKnV46saa	Maya Angelou is a really good African American poet.  She is the person who wrote "Phenomenal Woman".  A good one is "I know Why the Caged Bird Sings."    A free bird leaps on the back  Of the wind and floats downstream  Till the current ends and dips his wing  In the orange suns rays  And dares to claim the sky.    But a bird that stalks down his narrow cage  Can seldom see through his bars of rage  His wings are clipped and his feet are tied  So he opens his throat to sing.    The caged bird sings with a fearful trill  Of things unknown but longed for still  And his tune is heard on the distant hill for  The caged bird sings of freedom.    The free bird thinks of another breeze  And the trade winds soft through  The sighing trees  And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright  Lawn and he names the sky his own.    But a caged BIRD stands on the grave of dreams  His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream  His wings are clipped and his feet are tied  So he opens his throat to sing.    The caged bird sings with  A fearful trill of things unknown  But longed for still and his  Tune is heard on the distant hill  For the caged bird sings of freedom.

M0bE2IBQaa	The number one greek mythology book is 'Bulfinch's Mythology'. It's excellent. Every single mythological story from the beginning of time all the way to like king arthur. I have a copy from barnes and noble. It's very readable, and even has a map of the gods. it has a table of content and index, and even a glossary of the gods that you can look at. It's really old too, so scholars and laymen have been using it for nearly a century.    "Mythology" by Edith Hamilton is also nice. It gives a thorough overview of the Greek mythology with summaries of great stories (e.g. Iliad & Odyssey) plus other legends. It also has brief discussions of other mythologies (e.g. Roman and Norse)  Definitely a great read for those who are starting to have interest in the ancient myths, most particularly, Greek.|`|ugiUyhOwaa	?The Complete World of Greek Mythology by Richard Buxton    ?Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes by Edith Hamilton    ?The Library of Greek Mythology by Apollodorus and Robin Hard    ?Iliad by Homer    ?The Oddysey by Homer    ?The Aenied by Virgil    ?Beowulf|`|YUjVFkocaa	Gates of Fire, The Iliad, The Odyssey, Spartans.|`|exB1zxgVaa	try Homers The Illiad, or The Odyssey. both very nice. the Illiad is over the trojan war (Greeks vs. Troy) and the odyessy is over a greek solider from the trojan war's 1o year journey to get hom to his wife and kid. both very nice.|`|a5abc95c0baa7453e31caa755c283f91aa	The story on Prometheus.

9IlQXYnXaa	Ok, you do need a bit of luck when thinking about whether or not people or talent scouts who are in the Music industry will notice and approach you. However, you will be perfectly fine without luck. Because if you're committed enough to getting a record deal, (which would be your daughter's ultimate aim) you don't need luck.     To start off your daughter is a bit young to start doing anything at the moment, but when she gets a bit more older she will either need to:    1. Join a music and/or singing club, because she will need to meet people who can play various instruments. And with these people she will need to try and create her own music. With the songs she creates with her band, she needs to record them in a music studio. (search on-line for the nearest ones) When you have you music as an mp3 file or on a CD, (the studio will should help you sort this out) you need to promote them as much as possible. Get a MySpace music and add as many people as you can!     Or    2. Record videos of her singing to the instrumental version of a song. Perhaps she could play a 'SingStar' (computer game) song in the background and then sing to it. But i would say it's best to learn an instrument (i recommend a keyboard or piano because it's easier to play than any other common instruments- or she could try the acoustic, however i think it's harder for young people to learn) and help her do a cover of a song she likes. You don't need to record her with an expensive video camera. Then what you need to do with the video is post it on Youtube. There are over a 100 million viewers of videos on Youtube each day and if you're really good, word will spread quickly!    Finally, when she really has her act together, i suggest visiting Musician's Union (search for one near you!) and they will help you find people like managers and agents who find gigs for her to perform etc...these people are very important but they do charge and you will need to pay out a lot of money to people like this...accountants, layers etc... Yeah they should tell you everything you need to know. But she really needs to be committed because it is very hard work making it to the top!     Remember that there are always singing auditions for competitions around, you just have to look for where they are and for the suitable age range. These places are also where talent scouts may linger.   I wish the very best of luck to your daughter in persuing her dream!

qvtDvVZraa	I agree with cloning humans.  It would would be a big step in the field of science and many more discoveries could be made from it.  For all we know, humans could have already been cloned.  Once you get rid of the ethical/ moral views, cloning humans isn't so bad.  With cloning humans...  --> With cloning, infertile couples could have children.   --> With human cloning and its technology it may be possible to ensure that we no longer suffer because of our defective genes.   --> We may be able to clone livers for liver transplants   -->We may be able to clone kidneys for kidney transplants  -->We should be able to clone the bone marrow for children and adults suffering from leukemia  The list goes on, and you can learn more from this site : http://robby.nstemp.com/about.html|`|AA11564934	I have no problem with it whatsoever.    People have this impression that if we follow some particular plan, humans will attain some unidentified something that we simply will not.    The fact is that all humans and all life will be gone someday.  The condition of life before that occasion is completely irrelevant.    Would you wash your TV before you put it on the trash?|`|foKxdNeTaa	I wish I could clone myself secretly...so i could kill my real self and nobody would notice or be upset.|`|ivPptkvfaa	Why do you need our opinions? Are you incapable of forming your own? I personally disagree with human cloning mainly because we don't know the effects of it and it could lead to unforeseen problems.|`|gWLhIoIiaa	right now i dont see the need for it. but i dont disagree with it. i think a lof of people freak out at the thought of it but it's not like the longstanding science fiction idea where you go into a box and come out and get an exact duplicate of yourself. it would be a totally separate human being with potential of looking like you at the most. but i think the most important factors on how a person turns out is environmental. i think think twins would be more alike than a clone and their cloned "parent". but who knows?|`|AA11503678	I disagree, because when scientists try really hard, its outcomes can be disastrous. Einstein's big dream turned out to be an atom bomb. This cloning can go out of control, and nasty results can be seen.|`|gspTDufpaa	I'm totally against human cloning. That is just disgusting to me. And I can't see what point it would serve.|`|O4m7cKHCaa	I don't agree with cloning humans or animals. However, I do hope that the cloning technology will advance to the point where they can take cells from a persons organ like a heart or lung, or any other organ and grow another organ to replace a diseased organ. I would not like to see them clone a whole human for spare parts.|`|YCpz0oQSaa	dissagree|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Humans already periodically auto-clone.  We call these clones 'twins', 'triplets', and so on.  This is not viewed as particularly strange and unnatural... in some contexts this connection is lauded as a particularly close one.    If natural clones are perfectly okay, why should we be upset with artificially produced ones?  We hardly expect people to chase wild animals for milk or shear their own sheep (or even necessarily use animal wool at all).  We have other ways of producing these things.    Sure, there will be an adjustment period.  All new technologies have this.  The process will be abused and it will have its shady characters without a doubt.  But it is a matter of record that no technology has ever been developed and not used.  And I think it's very likely that a century from now nobody will think much of it, just as we don't think much about computers and vaccines which might have seemed strange and alien a hundred years ago.  So it goes.|`|iYZqiZuxaa	I think that we should be able to clone ourselves. I would love to have a clone and theres was a movie made that was about clones.i forgot  the name of the movie but in the movie the clones were used to give birth for humans and other things like that. the clones basicly kept people from going through diseases and other illnesses, and from feeling pain i think. i saw it a few years ago and it should give tells why it is a good idea and why it is a bad idea.|`|fSlCE0jBaa	Disagree, i guess.  what would be the point of having a clone?  sure. it would be fun but i think people are messing to much with mother nature. and @ the first answer... what's up with that? god didn't intend for us to just grow another organ. we live than we die. that's nature. i think it's gods choice to decide when we will die, not some scientist.

"Blood roared in my ears and ice cold air pierced my lungs." Classic! Unique! And totally Style-licios! But it kinda went down hill from there. Maybe you -or your charicter- ditches the sword so insted of "My sword hung uselessly at my side, I couldnt fight five warriors all at once." it would be something like "I had relived myself of my sword a while back. It was a dead whate considering I couldn't fend off 5, maybe more, warriors at once." Please write more, it sounds like a good story! Mmmm... Brain Spark! Maybe something terible could happen, but your still alive. Then it turns out to be a dream you reliving!  Just a thought.|`|lrZSzvxuaa	What that's it. I was already into it.  Umm, maybe you can make point in Faia's either panic, exhaustion, or maybe wound.   Maybe you can explain on how Faia almost lost (I think it's a) her balance like this.  -Just by hearing my name be called made relief swosh over me. My knee's turned into rubble and the buckled under me. Then I remembered that I wasn't out of the situation just yet. I made use of my sword at that point taking it out of it's guard. I stabbed the floor and the force pulled m back up as I grabbed my sword, replaced it on it's guard in it's place by my side. After I did this I used the last of my strength to sprint toward the direction oh my name. Hoping that help was near by.-  If you want you can use it, I don't mind. Or you can always do something like that.|`|YUjVFkocaa	Everything is good, except the name.    Even IF that's your real name (which I doubt), it's weird and mystical, and sounds like it'd be one of those fantasy novels.    And there are way too many fantasy novels out there at this point, so it would probably take away from the novel.  It would also annoy me, reading that name.  Picking a regular girl name, any other kind, would suffice.    ======================    And change the line about running to "I was running as fast as I could, but they were still steadily gaining" or something like that.  You give the appearance that they have already caught you- it takes away from the excitement.    The last sentence should either have a semicolon ( ;) or a period ( . ) instead of the comma.  It's really TWO different sentences.

HORACAnlaa	To be, or not to be: that is the question:  Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer  The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,  Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,  And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;  No more; and by a sleep to say we end  The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks  That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation  Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;  To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;  For in that sleep of death what dreams may come  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,  Must give us pause: there's the respect  That makes calamity of so long life;  For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,  The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,  The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,  The insolence of office and the spurns  That patient merit of the unworthy takes,  When he himself might his quietus make  With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,  To grunt and sweat under a weary life,  But that the dread of something after death,  The undiscover'd country from whose bourn  No traveller returns, puzzles the will  And makes us rather bear those ills we have  Than fly to others that we know not of?  Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;  And thus the native hue of resolution  Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,  And enterprises of great pith and moment  With this regard their currents turn awry,  And lose the name of action. - Soft you now!

Which one ever you pick, write it down and write you a short story about a fictional character that is involved with this emotion, but include your emotions. Once you have it all written down, basically throw some satire and humor in with it and write a story board. Before long you will have a cartoon. It will be easier to write it if it comes from you. Don't think to hard about what will make people laugh, but think about what makes you.

One recent example I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander VI did nothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to his wishes, because he well understood this side of mankind."

As you have observed, these are the decrees that are inconstant: he whom a single moment has made happy, has been harmed by many other moments;     And this is the abode that will show pity for no man, nor will any condition remain in its state for it.     Fate irrevocably destroys every ample coat of mail when Mashrifi [1] swords and spears glance off without effect;     It unsheaths each sword only to destroy it even if it be an Ibn Dhi Yazan and the scabbard Ghumdan[2]     Where are the crowned kings of Yemen and where are their jewel-studded diadems and crowns?     Where are [the buildings] Shaddad raised in Iram[3] and where [the empire] the Sassanians ruled in Persia?     Where is the gold Qarun[4] once possessed; where are `Ad and Shaddad and Qahtan?[5]     An irrevocable decree overcame them all so that they passed away and the people came to be as though they had never existed.     The kingdoms and kings that had been came to be like what a sleeper has told about [his] dream vision.     Fate turned against Darius as well as his slayer,[6]  and as for Chosroes,[7] no vaulted palace offered him protection.     It is as if no cause had ever made the hard easy to bear, and as if Solomon had never ruled the world.     The misfortunes brought on by Fate are of many different kinds, while Time has causes of joy and of sorrow.     For the accidents [of fortune] there is a consolation that makes them easy to bear, yet there is no consolation for what has befallen Islam.     An event which cannot be endured has overtaken the peninsula; one such that Uhud has collapsed because of it and Thahlan has crumbled![8]     The evil eye has struck [the peninsula][9] in its Islam so that [the land] decreased until whole regions and districts were despoiled of [the faith]     Therefore ask Valencia what is the state of Murcia; and where is Jativa, and where is Jan?     Where is Cordoba, the home of the sciences, and many a scholar whose rank was once lofty in it?     Where is Seville and the pleasures it contains, as well as its sweet river overflowing and brimming full?     [They are] capitals which were the pillars of the land, yet when the pillars are gone, it may no longer endure!     The tap of the white ablution fount weeps in despair, like a passionate lover weeping at the departure of the beloved,     Over dwellings emptied of Islam that were first vacated and are now inhabited by unbelief;     In which the mosques have become churches wherein only bells and crosses may be found.     Even the mihrabs weep though they are solid; even the pulpits mourn though they are wooden!     0 you who remain heedless though you have a warning in Fate: if you are asleep, Fate is always awake!     And you who walk forth cheerfully while your homeland diverts you [from cares], can a homeland beguile any man after [the loss of] Seville?     This misfortune has caused those that preceded it to be forgotten, nor can it ever be forgotten for the length of all time!     0 you who ride lean, thoroughbred steeds which seem like eagles in the racecourse;     And you who carry slender, Indian blades which seem like fires in the darkness caused by the dust cloud [of war],     And you who are living in luxury beyond the sea enjoying life, you who have strength and power in your homelands,     Have you no news of the people of Andalus, for riders have carried forth what men have said [about them]?     How often have the weak, who were being killed and captured while no man stirred, asked our help?     What means this severing of the bonds of Islam on your behalf, when you, 0 worshipers of God, are [our] brethren?     Are there no heroic souls with lofty ambitions; are there no helpers and defenders of righteousness?     0, who will redress the humiliation of a people who were once powerful, a people whose condition injustice and tyrants have changed?     Yesterday they were kings in their own homes, but today they are slaves in the land of the infidel!     Thus, were you to see them perplexed, with no one to guide them, wearing the cloth of shame in its different shades,     And were you to behold their weeping when they are sold, the matter would strike fear into your heart, and sorrow would seize you.     Alas, many a mother and child have been parted as souls and bodies are separated!     And many a maiden fair as the sun when it rises, as though she were rubies and pearls,     Is led off to abomination by a barbarian against her will, while her eye is in tears and her heart is stunned.     The heart melts with sorrow at such [sights], if there is any Islam or belief in that heart!]  (Lament for Seville, Abu al-Baqa' al-Rundi (d.1285),     Translated from Arabic by James T.

Both of Grandpa's parents were born in Canada.  Both of Grandma's were born in Scotland.  Her mother came to Canada in 1861 as an indentured servant, and served for 17 years.  Her father's family moved to Canada because of the potato famine in Scotland.  My mother's family, for the most part, has been in this country since the 1700s.  One line goes back to 1600s Massachusetts.  Most came from England, but there are some that we haven't traced back yet.  Both of her parents were born in Michigan.  Grandpa's mother was born in Michigan, but both of her parents were born in Canada, and came to Michigan after they were married in 1855. We know next to nothing about Grandpa's father.  The only record that I have found so far for him is the marriage to my great-grandmother.  Grandma's family came to Michigan from New York state, Ohio, and Indiana.

94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	The Byzantine's greatest cause for decline was...The Renaissance.    With the Renaissance/High middle ages (from about 1200 on), Byzantium was no longer something special.    For instance, she relied a lot on trade with the east for her wealth; she now had rivals for this trade, eg., Venice, Genoa, and (for awhile) the Crusader states.  Byzantine industry - eg., pottery, cloissone, fine metalwork, even silk - now faced competition from Italy and France.      Another reason was the failure of Byzantine diplomacy.  The Byzantines had survived for centuries by pitting its enemies against each other.  This meant - essentially - picking the winner in decisive contests.  But when she made key errors, eg., when she picked the Ottomans to LOSE a major war against other Turks in Asia Minor, she gained a permanent enemy.    Lastly, was her failure to adopt new technology.  For instance, cannon had been used in Spain in the 12th century, in France (Battle of Crecy) in the 14th century; but the Byzantines were very slow to adopt firearms.  Thus their city walls fell to a large Turkish cannon; designed by a Hungarian.|`|s7BECvzAaa	it was stretched too far. if im not mistaken it had 2 capitals eastern and western empire, rome and byzantium (constantinople).  definitely communication between these 2 far spread cities would be difficult, also they had different predominant religions.
h1GZnjdnaa	Actually politics, wealth and a lack of interest in wars and building armies were the main factors that kept Phoenician city-states independent and not geography.   Please read below for a more detailed answer and a comparison to the Greek city-states.    Each city-state had a powerful guild of merchants that dictated it's policies and each city-state had a specialty, e.g. Byblos in bulk cedar wood and wooden items, Tyre in the murex dye and shipping, Sidon in glass and medicines, etc... So due to the specialization of each city and of the different divinities that were worshiped by each guild, based on its nature, the city-states remained independent.     As for the prosperity, the Phoenicians were innovative, energetic and skilled merchants.  The Phoenicians were true merchants, the sea trading routes and people they traded with were their nations. They had no ambitions to conquer anyone, and that's why they never had a powerful military, unlike the Greeks. The only anomaly was Carthage, but even then, the army of Carthage was mainly composed of mercenaries unlike the Greek and the Romans later.    The Greeks had similar city-states and many colonies as well, but the Greeks weren't true merchants, they felt that their destiny in this world was to create a powerful Greek nation that would rule the world. This is why the Greek city-states were split into two camps: the Athena and Sparta camps. And after many wars Athena won, and consequently became the capital of Greece till this day. We can't say that at all of the Phoenicians.|`|AA10729675	Their intelligence.  They invented the alphabet.  And they exported what they manufactured.

785J9LWFaa	I'll actually answer about Col. Fitzwilliam and not his cousin Darcy. ;)    Off hand, no I can't remember a physical description of him, but Jane Austen was never much into giving detailed physical descriptions of people in general I find (I think perhaps to let the reader imagine them how they wantd to).  With the Colonel, I always got more of a "sense" of the character, who he was. Knowing he is Georgianna'a gaurdian with Darcy and a close friend of Darcy speaks highly of the trust people can and do place in him as a person of responsibility and sound morals. Obviously from the kind of person Bingley is, Darcy picks people who are kind to spend his time with. This is easily seen in Elizabeth's response to him. She instantly takes a liking to him. This should also speak highly of him. At Rosings, even though he comes from a wealthy family as the son of an earl and nephew to Lady Catherine, Lizzy feels very at ease and drawn to him.   I saw the character once acted in a play as a haughty and whinny man and it felt so uterly wrong.   Hope that helps a little.|`|DvToP5h7aa	Pride and Prejudice study guides:     About Fitzwilliam Darcy     The last we checked, Facebook had over 400 groups containing the name "Mr. Darcy." A simple random sample of the titles: "I Refuse to Settle For Anything Less Than Mr. Darcy" "Im Not Looking for Mr. Right, Im Looking for Mr. Darcy," "I love Mr. Darcy enough to make Jane Austen uncomfortable." What on earth is it about Mr. Darcy that invokes an ardor almost equal to that commanded by Brad Pitt or Tom Brady (who are, you know, alive)?    Part of us doesnt get the appeal. If we invited Mr. Darcy to our annual Christmas bash, hed stand in the corner, refuse to speak to anyone, and silently judge our Santa hat. On the surface, the man is gloomy and proud.    But part of us really understands the appeal of Mr. Darcy. You see, his cold exterior masks a passionately romantic man whos simply uncomfortable around people he doesnt know very well. Hes awkward in his pursuit of Elizabeth  visiting her constantly at Charlottes house only to sit there looking grumpy. Smooth moves, Darcy. And lets not forget about his proposal. He starts out strong with the I-cant-contain-my-feelings-any-longer part, but he rapidly devolves into denigrating (read: trash talking) Elizabeths inferior social position and embarrassing relatives. We hardly blame her for lecturing him on manners.    But who thought Mr. Darcy would actually listen to Elizabeths criticisms? The next time Elizabeth sees Darcy, hes much more pleasant. He makes an effort to get to know her aunt and uncle, and makes an even greater effort to rescue Lydia and the rest of the Bennet family from complete social disgrace. The best part is, hes doing it all for love. The question is, did Darcy change for love, or was his true nature simply revealed with some prodding from Elizabeth?     http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...
iNXqiDIYaa	is it just from you or a class project?    i can't really help with a class project as this depends very much on what your teacher wants and how he/she has told you to write it    if it is just a personal letter just say something like    Dear Mr Pettit    Thank you very much for coming to our school to talk about Edgar Allen Poe.  I really enjoyed you talk and found it very interesting.  One part I found especially enjoyable was (and then put in a short bit about one part)    Once again thanks a load for coming and talking to us.    Yours sincerely    Keep it short like this and he will really appreciate receiving your thanks

O3MVfM3Baa	Regarding the subject of his paintings they describe growing french bourgeoisie and their, middle class newly emerging, way of life.    Regarding his technique it mirrors (again) growing rebellion against uniform ways of creating, and general dissatisfaction of the intellectual elites with the uniformity and conformism bourgeoisie popularized.

caA4NSF2aa	Two acoustic guitars that I always recommend to beginning players:    Rogue RA-100D: http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/produ...    Jasmine by Takamine S35:http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/produ...    They're both in your budget, and excellent quality for their price.    EDIT - also Guitar Center should have both of them, and for the exact same price as Musician's Friend.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	All kinds out there. Try a pawn shop first sometime people buy top of the line just to never play them. Question should be electric or acoustic? If you are just being Try and electric they're easier to learn on.|`|WxqCHZfiaa	You probably can't get a good guitar for 100, you can probably find one between 100 and 200 however.  Most guitar stores will have staff who know about the specific guitars in their store and can answer your questions.|`|bilBsC0Raa	Unfortunately, you won't get much with a $100 guitar. If you are willing to spend $25-$50 more you can get a nice Ibanez. I recommend getting an acoustic-electric guitar. There are a couple of Squiers in your price range.
AA10725882	One huge difference was that America did not have a home grown group of titled, wealthy, over-privileged aristocrats to "whittle down" via the guillotine.  (The pun was intended. Yuk Yuk)    Another is that the French were not overthrowing the rule of a distant mother country.  The French were overthrowing a ruling class.    There are many others.  These are the first that came to mind.  You should get other good ideas here.  Interesting question.    Good luck with the essay|`|Dz0Z3Aogaa	One was a revolution led by Societies leaders and the other was a revolution led by the under class.  This is a generalization but the fluid nature of class in the colonies allowed for a more united front against distant adversaries.  While in France wealth, privilege and class fostered an environment of distrust and revenge.
Ow3O7h4caa	I totally agree with Pooryorr. Sm 58 or Sm 57 have been around for ages. But if you want the best brand besides Shure if you have the money, get a Sennheiser microphone. They are expensive but the sound that it produces justifies the amount you pay for them.    AKG as pointed out by Big D is a good microphone although the Perception 200 is a better investment by far. The Perception 100 is good for vocals, drum overheads, strings, brass, and most acoustic instruments e.g. guitars.  Having said this, it is not that good for stage work (live shows etc...) if you are working with aa Brass or violin section or if the drummer is directly in line with it since it can often pick up other sounds from around the room. It is important to use the right placement considering the polar pattern of this mic.  This is a good mike for a projecthome studio.    My choice would be a Behringer ULTRALINK UL2000M or Sennheiser.|`|PJOApEx1aa	Microsoft|`|b5xJqC5oaa	ROCKBAND YEA!!!!!|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	AKG Perception 100 Professional|`|MYkqiYSzaa	Hey Metalhead:       Um.. the AKG Perception 100 Professional would be ok for studio use, but I definately would not take it to the stage.  First off.. its a condenser mic, which means the sound tech would have to fire up phantom power on the board for ONE MIC!  Most of em I know (including myself) would not do that in a live setting with your average bar band type gear.  Its a little different in the pro venues, where the quality of  mixers plays a huge difference.           For 100 bucks, the Shure SM 58 has been an industry standard mic for years no matter if your playing in a bar band or doing 20,000 seat venues.  Its a great mic, virtually indestructable, and reproduces your voice pretty dang well.         Another mic worth looking into is the Audix OM5 at about 160 or so out the door.  I really like this mic for small LOUD stages.  Its polar pattern is such that it minimalizes bleedthrough from other instruments around you, making it a very good mic from a sound techs perspective to get the most out of the singer on that cramped stage.       Hope this has helped, and good luck!

ugiUyhOwaa	Whoa!    1. How can we threw away the 1/2 of the sky in the first place? And if we do, I think there will be because what should replace the place of the thrown away sky? Of course, the clouds!    2. I dunno cause I'm not bald. Maybe they just wash their head with soap.    3.It's almost not possible for grasses to grow underground because the sunlight, which grasses need for their photosynthesis,  cannot reach them.    4. No, I mean the next word I'll say is not no. Get it?  (LOL. This one made me smile...)    5.Well, I still think downward because of the Earth's gravity.|`|fMfBAgOUaa	If we threw away half the sky, half the clouds would go with it ;)    Id imagine most use shampoo since regular soap would dry out your skin quickly.    You wouldnt.    It might be ;)    It would go on its tail of course.|`|YSoBO3tpaa	four was sick.....no one can read that w/o saying No...|`|qDYzdz5daa	If someone came up with a meaningful koan, would it be the first?|`|0IjomiJ2aa	wow....  you must be the sage of the ages.  Or overly laden with the inane|`|f2cQrG7jaa	That's pretty good. I could make up answers to these questions but leaving them open is more fun. If clouds could be angry would they? If grass grew underground would we know it? If I knew the next word I would say was no, would I still say it? If birds have always been flying upside down, would we know the difference?|`|8msce8KPaa	4 made me smile =)    but for number two I use shampoo, its better for the scalp|`|5wJiY8hmaa	If grass grew underground we wouldn't mow it until it grew high enough to see it especially in America. lol|`|Gymfznayaa	With most fond of ponderings ( first pondering thought to come to mind):    If we threw away 1/2 the sky, would there be enough room for the clouds? We would live in the clouds, yay marshmellow land!    Do bald men wash there heads with soap or shampoo? Face wash      If grass grew underground, how would we mow it? Remote control mower that can mow upside down.    Is the next word your going to say no? In my head yes, i was the last word i read    If a bird flew upside down, where would it's poop go? in theyre faces, bout time they copped it hehehe|`|R13GcTQZaa	If we threw away 1/2 the sky, would there be enough room for the clouds?  --- Yes.    Do bald men wash there heads with soap or shampoo?  ---Soap, I did when I shaved my head.      If grass grew underground, how would we mow it?  --- We wouldnt, unless it was in a cave underground.    Is the next word your going to say no?  ---Hell if i know.    If a bird flew upside down, where would it's poop go?  ---Try it, see what happens.|`|0AyH9jdxaa	the rest of the clouds would just be floating in this nothingness.    shampoo. Um...out of instinct?    You wouldn't...until it grew out from under the surface, then u would mow it.    No. And i didn't say that, i TYPED it. And said it in my mind. Which doesn't count..so ha.    The poop would not fly out of it's butt. Gravity would keep it inside until it overflowed and leaked out. And then it would fall off and go downward. xD gross huh? Well u asked it =]|`|Q5CsKq7Uaa	yes but they would be cramped    soap    we wouldnt    trick question    it would come out and slide off its butt
8MQUXZaJaa	I think thinking negatively is mostly habit.     We pick things up off other people, like you said, and repeat them. It's partly in order to fit in, and partly because if we aim to succeed and THEN fail, we feel worse than if we were already convinced of our failure.    There is a problem at the level of society too which keeps us constantly wanting things, people, feelings, money, etc, etc....    Maybe the solution is to not worry about whether we are successful or not. Not crave things that will make us feel better. But to do the thing that is in front of us to be done... and to just do what we intuitively know needs to be done.    And do something fun to take your mind off things when you feel down|`|TuHf2dWTaa	If you say you ''can't do something'', ask yourself "why" you can't do something. Make sure this reason is logical, and can be supported.      The quote "you can do anything if you set your mind to it", is false, but you have a higher chance of doing something if you have the will to do so.    To get out of poverty you need to first stop thinking about riches, and start to think of how you can improve your life you are living. If you continue to improve then you will never be faced with the decline of poverty.    Depressed to extraordinary? Well I believe you should find a purpose in life. Something that you feel strong enough connected to that will ensure the progression of your life.    Bad things are overcome with good, so just live the life you want to live, and if you make a mistake make sure to fix it.|`|hMR0aVVAaa	PLEASE WATCH THIS MARJORIE E...it's the Secret and this is also meant for you..I hope you'll feel better soon...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b1GKGWJb...    and everything in the video is true and i prove it myself...you can be whatever you want to be...just THINK and FEEL it...you may not be able to think of it or feel it at first, but that's just natural, ROme isnt built in a day, so you just have to keep trying and trying..you can do it!|`|fGlGg5EUaa	because you surrounded by negative people!!stay away from them, you will find the positive!!|`|UY6c7DG8aa	You seem to be scared of the possibility of failing. Seems like me that whoever influenced you, whether wanted or not, made you think that failure is something horrible. But is not. You're afraid of failing, but failing isn't that bad.  What I do when i lack confidence(which is your problem now) is writing down all the things i did that makes me proud. For me i've won a couple of small school awards. It really could be anything. List at least 10, and by that you see, I CAN do all these things, I am somebody. This gave me great deal of confidence. But if you didn't get any awards or stuff and feel like sh!t from trying to write these down, then you got to think: Why wasn't I able to do these things? The answer is they tried, and you didn't. To get you to try, you need a strong motivation. You need to be initiative. Don't ever say " i'm not good enough", say i can do that ten times better. Believe in yourself.  The real difference between us and successful people is that they are in a positive cycle. They work, and they get something out of it, something they're proud of, makes them happy, then they work more and more, and they get more and more. Now losers like us(yeah i'm quite a loser too) tried, but failed. But rather than trying again, we just say what's good does trying do? I don't have the abilities. But if you could just force yourself into that positive cycle, you'd become more positive, and actually get the joy of accomplishments.|`|3pHoY8F6aa	"Im very influenced by people around me and I find it hard to think positive because the people around me don't."      You already answered your own question  I find it hard to think positive because the people around me don't.    And you even know why  Im very influenced by people around me.    We are the product of our environment (among other factors, but environment is the only one we have the freedom to control). The influence actually begins with our feelings. The way we feel often signals our unconscious moods. Those moods then find their way to the conscious mind and influence our thoughts and you know the rest.    What you need to do is place yourself in a healthy environment, one with positive thinkers, or at least one with fewer negative thinkers. This does not mean you have to completely cut off all ties with your negative friends, though personally I don't see why you would want to keep negative people around if you don't have to (parents). You have to go out and find more positive people. Youll notice that you'll start to enjoy life and yourself a lot more when you do, and eventually the desire for negative company will subside.    Surround yourself with confident, independent, determined, strong-willed, goal-oriented, open-minded, successful, intelligent, courageous, extraordinary and friendly people.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Start thinking negatively with intent and positivity will be created in compensation. We are all expecting things all the time and when we are unwilling to go through it that's called conflict. What specifically is bad about negative thoughts? None of us want to be happy, we just want what it offers us. Being okay with being depressed is when it changes. Life is creating terrifying things all the time for us to be terrified of and will try something else when the last thing stops working. You can never avoid the wholeness of it, but you can be very specific. The more specific the issue, the easier you can deal with it. Specifics deconstruct your previous assumptions.|`|KbZi3Qm3aa	Write a list of all you have to be thankful for. Then write another list of all the things that inspire you. Then write a list of all the people you are thankful for having them in your life. Then take one thing from each list that is your favorite. Now whether it be a picture or you just write it on a piece of paper put this in your private space where you will see it every morning and every night. Even the ceiling over you bed. Those people on your list, you need to call them and tell them how thankful you are for having them in your life. I hope you only pick the most positive folks, Now This is straight up advice.If a person is bad they will probably get worse,  If a person is good they will probably get better. So if someone or something can't provide positives in your life just walk away and don't look back ever. Just do your best at bringing as much beauty as you can into your life, don't worry about  what anybody thinks. Thinking positive is a learned behavior just like the negative. Chin up deep breath smile you winner you. CHOW

v70p2kgWaa	Sorry but I feel the same about calling books from the 90s old.  Several series including LJ Smith's Night World series are popular again right now and are even being released.  Which is one I would suggest to you.  I also would suggest Both Sides of Time by Caroline B. Cooney, but whatever...    Try a book called Wicked Lovely by Melissa Marr.  Aiislinn has grown up in fear of a world she sees but no one else does, the world of the faeries.  However, just as she is starting to have a semi-normal life, including a boyfriend, everything is torn apart by the appearance Keenan.  Now Aiislinn is in a fight to keep her dreams, her man, and even her humanity from being taken away by a king among those being she has been taught to fear her whole life.  http://www.melissa-marr.com/melissa_marr...    Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins was published this past year and is pretty good too.  Panem lies in the ruins of what was once North American. Every year, the 12 districts of Panem must send 2 youths to compete in the Hunger Games, a fight for survival where only one person can live. Katniss is a sixteen year old girl from the mining district called District 12 (Appalachian Mountains area, the farest east due to the atomic fall out of the distuction of the east coast District 13).  Life in the poorest district is hard enough for Katniss and her close friend Gale, but when Katniss's little sister is chosen for the Hunger Games, she steps up to take her place.  Now Katniss must fight for survival and it seems that her only chance might be to pretend she loves her fellow competator from District 12 when her heart is really back home with Gale.  http://www.scholastic.com/thehungergames...|`|YA36FUf1aa	"Old books from the 1990s"    Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!|`|JEP4CmyUaa	If u like vampires u should read Vampire Academy series or House of Night series. They're really good!!|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	as above...      "Old books from the 1990s"    Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!|`|oHL8qA42aa	A Great and Terrible Beauty|`|4nhkC9qYaa	I would try Atlas Shrugged, its a really cool romance novel by Ayn Rand, I think it is a little bit more than 300 pages but I loved it|`|0aEYjVzMaa	don't BUY anything unless you sure YOU really like it  seriously, what's wrong with the library?|`|1NWjta2jaa	Do you want one with the cover matching your shoes?|`|QnVypDNQaa	i agree with that person above me - the 1990's were not that long ago, pal.    You should really read a book called I am the Messenger by Markus Zusak.  It is about a random guy who starts getting these playing cards in the mail with good deeds that he has to do like stop a domestic violence attack and keep an old lady company.  there's a tad of romance but nothing major.  I don't know if I described it well but it's a great book.|`|7v1wqeWDaa	Okay..well it is 352 pages and is a very good book. It is called Dark Moon and is by Alton Gansky.  It is about s red spot on the moon that starts growing in size and the scientist who discovered it does not know what it is, and this woman that has been stuck in a sanitarium...(I think thats what its called)...gets into this at some point...you would love it...well I don't know that but it is interesting to me.|`|OVEBKd7Laa	You have to read 'Don't Die, My Love'.   It's an amazing book. I don't think its that old.    It's about this teenage couple, who are completely in love. One night after getting home from a date, the girl notices that he has a lump on his neck, or behind his ear (forgot where). He finds out he has cancer. You have to read it. I cried lol.  Oops. It's not over 300 pages. Sorry.|`|aBhW9YVXaa	well, a good one i reada little while ago was "ten things to do before i die"..its about a kid who was poisoned and can only live 1 more day, so he tries to do some crazy stuff before he dies...i liked it...another good classic is tangerine...its not romantic at all but its really good..paul moves, things happen...its very good...

KHVvDMLYaa	jeez dont listen to the others...  imprinting is what werewolves do. there is a soulmate out there for them. once they see her, they will be addicted to them. their love for everyone else will go away and they will be crazily attached to the female they imprint on. if the female is young, the werewolf will wait until she gets older. then a romantic relationship will develop.  werewolves dont grow by the way. only taller and more muscular|`|JEP4CmyUaa	Yeah|`|5L5GQYFXaa	yes when a wolf imprintes on a person then they are tied together forever sure the person has the choice to be or not to be with the wolf but most times then others the person will feel the same way|`|fna0OfuCaa	Yes, it means that Jacob will never love anyone else, that as soon as he saw her he knew she was the one for him forever.|`|XLRx5decaa	It means he wants to have sex with her once she's older.|`|FE4B8uynaa	Yup. when Jacob imprinted on Nessie he found his love. Meaning he will never look at anyone the same or love anyone like he loves Nessie.They are indeed soulmates.And she also loves him. Shes really smart. He is not a rapist either. He said he doesn't look at her that way.  :]|`|l3b0hjdWaa	It means that Stephanie Meyer turned Jacob into a pedophile. He was the coolest, funniest, character of them all not to mention he was ripped and walked around half naked all the time and she ruined his image and the story all together in the process|`|AA11055057	Yup. it also means he's a borderline rapist.|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	Borderline rapist? No way.  It just means that she's his perfect mate and that one day they'll be married. Or something.|`|f1aac05e2cf2f28dae8cc17db6309e92aa	In New Moon or Eclipse, i can't remember which, you learn that "imprinting" means basically falling head of heals, inseperably in love with someone.    When Jacob imprints on Rennesme then he falls into a love with her that is pretty much the strongest love you can possibly imagine. They are practically inseperable and it bothers BOTH of them to be away for any amount of time.    It's pretty much a display of the strongest possible love that many people only wish they could find in true life. (:|`|J8NEZ4V0aa	yes, when a werewolf imprints, it basicaly means "love at first sight" except stronger, like they were made especially for each other and everyone else pales in comparison the that specific person the werewolf imprints on. its kind of like when you see the girl or guy that you imprint on, that is the only thing you can think about and the feeling mever fades|`|NZZ8q6Ytaa	yes when a wolf imprintes on a person then they are tied together forever sure the person has the choice to be or not to be with the wolf but most times then others the person will feel the same way    Jacob imprints on Renesme because of his love of bella she looks like bella but she is also her child so she is he image of bella her hair is like bella's but is brownish|`|7p4p9MFVaa	ok...yah...whats up with all the like rapist answers?  yah...there kind of soul mates    but Jacob explains to Bella in either New Moon or Eclipse...like when Quil imprinted on Claire, its like hes tied to her...and he is like her perfect big brother. and as Claire and Renesmee get older, Jacob and Quil gradually change to be whatever Nessie and Claire need, whether thats a brother, or a friend, or a boyfriend type person...whatever...    right now for Jacob, its like he is a gaurdian angle for renesmee...sort of. He will always protect her no matter what, and always be there for her
IIa4efh5aa	ct 1 Scene 5: The Raven Himself Is Hoarse (Spoken by Lady Macbeth)    The raven himself is hoarse  That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan  Under my battlements. Come, you spirits  That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,  And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full  Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;  Stop up the access and passage to remorse,  That no compunctious visitings of nature  Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between  The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,  And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,  Wherever in your sightless substances  You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,  And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,  That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,  Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,  To cry 'Hold, hold!'  "The Raven Himself Is Hoarse" Soliloquy Translation:    'Even the raven - the bird of death - that croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan under my battlements is hoarse,' she said aloud. She closed her eyes and raised her arms to the sky. 'Come, you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts. Take all my femininity away and fill me from the crown to the toe top full of direst cruelty. Make thick my blood, stop me from feeling pity so that no natural feelings can get in the way.'    She put her hands on her breasts. 'Come to my woman's breasts, you spirits of evil, and suck gall from me where there should be milk. Come thick night and shroud me in the dunnest smoke of hell, so that my sharp knife won't see the wound it makes, nor that the light of heaven peep through the blanket of the dark to cry, 'stop! stop!'|`|eulMjLtPaa	http://nfs.sparknotes.com/macbeth/page_3...
HORACAnlaa	Too much work to explain it in depth. Here's my quick overview:    Linguistic -- the focus on  "words" forgetting there is a reality.    Relativistic -- a moral theory with no morality    Utilitarian -- The ends justify the means    Deontological -- If it's good for you it's bad. If it's good for others but bad for you it's good.    Situational -- There is a right but you find it in the moment.

What makes a person decide it's a psychological issue? What makes people think psychology is real. What makes us think that "we" are real?

Not only am I not a go with the flow type of person I am the type that once my mind is made up there is no changing it.|`|uyQXdKLiaa	The best way to answer this question would be with a name. Names are good because they are the most objective of words. Designations such as verbs, adjectives and nouns get assigned to things and replace the original entities in the human psyche. This operation replaces things with objects and reduces our ability to accurately see the universe.     "Everything which distinguishes man from the animals depends upon this ability to volatilize perceptual metaphors in a schema, and thus to dissolve an image into a concept."  -Nietzsche    Names, however are nearly arbitrary and thus do not distort or dissolve the original entity, they merely reference to it. Describing someone as anything more than their name further substitutes reality for concepts.
3cEqH3pfaa	Hadrian is regarded as a capable Emperor. He consolidated Roman territory after the expansions of Trajan,  tightened discipline of the army and gave the empire firm government and stable frontiers for over twenty years. He was also the only emperor to extensively travel the provinces of the entire empire, inspecting their government and assessing its defense and prosperity (Hadrian's Wall in Britain is only one of the defensive measures he undertook). Though efficient and energetic, Hadrian was not popular. Roman writers commented mostly on his private life, and his willful and jealous nature. The Roman historian Dio commented that  Hadrian was hated by the people, in spite of his generally excellent reign, because of the murders he committed. The Historia Augusta, though not openly accusing him of confirmed homosexuality, criticized him for his passion for males and also the adulteries with married women to which he was said to be addicted.  The Historia Augusta goes on to say "He ran to excess in the gratification of his desires, and wrote much verse about the subjects of his passions". Probably he was a man best seen from afar. His gifted and somewhat eccentric personal behavior would have made him an uncomfortable man to be near.|`|Dz0Z3Aogaa	He bult a Wall to keep teh Scotts from attacking.  Obabma is better.

I was feeling like that last year. What I did is that I told two of my best friends what was bothering me, and it made me feel great. Go ahead, and tell someone how you are feeling.

gnbBIRu6aa	Auschwitz-Birkenau was actually a collection of over a hundred different camps under a central administrative centre. As well as being a death camp it also served to provide slave labour to nearby heavy industry.    Other less well know camps were purely for extermination such as Sobibor or Belzec. Typically in these camps people were murdered soon after arrival, as there was no need for slave labour.|`|7KJcMpl9aa	Auschwitz-Birkenau was both.    There really wasn't much difference, because they would just work you to death in the work camps anyway.|`|Zkizt4EIaa	i know mauthausen was a death camp and auschwitz and daeku and berkenau and  belsen, sobibor, were labor camps im not sure but they were all horrific.
w13Zbnk7aa	small farm owners whose land had been dissplaced moved to the cities. there they found work in factories and mines. The owners (part of the middle class) got cheap labor from the workers. They were so poor that woman and children had to work...they got paid a fraction of what men did.    Britain's expanding population gave the country a great quantity of workers. These people would fill the growing demand for industrial labor in cities. This idea took them away from the countryside and solved an important problem. Small farmers were no longer landless.     Britain had capital to invest because       It became on of the wealthiest countries per capita in Europe because of its agricultural and commercial prosperity.       Britain gained and unusually ability to amass and mobilize that wealth into capital for potential investment.       The country was long free of internal tariff barriers, it had a uniform and stable monetary system, and the government sympathized with business interest.       This encouraged families to risk money on commerce and industry. This made it much easier to find the means to start an industrial enterprise in Britain (compared to anywhere else). This leads to entrepreneurship.|`|nBIGeJj9aa	Rural farmers moved to the cities.

lPxVt2XYaa	There were three revolutions in Russia in the first two decades of the 20th Century: the 1905, the February 1917 and the October 1917.  The one that led to the communists coming to power was the October Revolution.  It was led by Lenin, Stalin was the editor of Pravda - the party newspaper and a member of the ruling Politburo (like the Cabinet).  The exact date the revolution began was 25th October 1917.  Stalin came to power after Lenin died, in 1924.  See:  http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?p...|`|AA10242125	1917|`|YHeaFMXraa	It was a series of events starting in a revolution in 1905. During 1917 there were two major events, February 1917 - which was an unplanned "People's Revolution" and in October 1917 which was an organised revolution led by Lenin and Trotsky. Joseph Stalin was not a dictator at the time. Russia was ruled by the Romanov family until 1917 when a provisional government took hold. It was not until the 1920s when Stalin came into power.

wQ5kZrPHaa	UNDERWORLD!!! I really am disgusted! He reported my answer and copy and pasted it as his own! I reccomend his answer is deleted along with his trolll of a profile! Now i see how he is a top contributer!    Full name: Gaius Julius Caesar    Caesar is remembered as one of history's greatest generals and a key ruler of the Roman empire. As a young man he rose through the administrative ranks of the Roman republic, accumulating power until he was elected consul in 59 B.C. Over the next 15 years he led Roman armies against enemies abroad, especially in Gaul, while fighting Pompey and others for political control at home. In 45 B.C. he reached his ultimate success, being named dictator of Rome for life. That rule was short-lived: the next year he was stabbed to death in the Senate by a group led by his follower Marcus Junius Brutus. Caesar's life and death were dramatized in the William Shakespeare play Julius Caesar, with Caesar's famous death line: "Et tu, Brute? Then fall Caesar!"    Caesar is thought to have been assassinated on March 15th, a date known in the Roman calendar as "the Ides of March"... The ruling titles Kaiser and Czar are derived from the name of Caesar... Caesar had a famous romance with Egyptian ruler Cleopatra, and he fathered her son Caesarion... One of Caesar's trusted generals was Marc Antony, who became a lover and ally of Cleopatra after Caesar's death... Caesar's adopted heir was Octavian, who later defeated Antony and became the emperor Caesar Augustus.    Probably the greatest general in Rome's history, and among the most successful of all time, Caesar was also a skilful author who wrote detailed accounts of his campaigns. His seven books of Commentaries on the Gallic wars, three on the civil war, along with several books written by some of his officers to fill the gaps in the narrative, provide more information about Caesar's campaigns than those of any other ancient commander. The style of these works has had a massive influence on the writing of military history, down to the present day.    It is important to remember that Caesar was not simply a general, but also a politician. In Rome politics and war were inseparably linked. Success in war promoted a political career, which in turn led to greater opportunities for military command. Up until the year 58, Caesar's career followed the normal pattern for a Roman aristocrat, mixing military with civil posts. He served as a junior officer (tribune) in the east (80-78), being awarded Rome's highest decoration for gallantry, the corona civica, for saving a soldier's life at the siege of Mytilene. His first independent command came with his appointment as governor of Further Spain, where he led a small army in some successful police actions (61-60). However, after his political alliance with two of the most powerful politicians in Rome, Pompey and Crassus, Caesar received the consulship for the year 59 and an exceptionally large provincial command including Illyria, Cisalpine, and Transalpine Gaul in 58. At first his term of office was for five years, which was later extended to ten, an unprecedentedly long period.    Caesar was massively in debt and needed the profits derived from a successful war of conquest. He may well have contemplated marching from Illyria against the Dacian kingdom on the Danube, but the migration of the Helvetii offered him a perfect excuse to intervene in Gaul, an opportunity he accepted with alacrity (58). In eight years he conquered all of Gaul, defeated several rebellions, and advanced Rome's power to the Rhine. His victories were celebrated with public thanksgivings in Rome, and he took care to seize every chance to perform the spectacular, twice bridging the Rhine and leading expeditions to the strange and distant shores of Britain. Every winter he returned to Cisalpine Gaul to perform his judicial duties as governor, but also to keep an eye on the political climate at Rome. Vast quantities of booty and huge numbers of slaves covered Caesar's debts and made him exceptionally wealthy. He lavished much of this on his victorious soldiers, further increasing their loyalty to him.    Crassus had fallen at Carrhae in 53 and by the end of the Gallic wars, Pompey was unwilling to accept Caesar as a political equal and rival. He sided with Caesar's ardent opponents in the Senate who were determined to prosecute him as soon as the Gallic command expired. This led to the outbreak of the civil war in 49, when Caesar led his troops across the Rubicon, the narrow stream separating his province, where he legally exercised command, with Italy, where he did not. He secured Italy in a matter of weeks, with hardly a blow being struck. Then he moved to Spain and manoeuvred a Pompeian army into a hopeless position, forcing it to surrender at Ilerda. In 48 he crossed to Macedonia and after a hard campaign defeated Pompey himself at Pharsalus.

AA10242125	"What we now call Black History Month was originated in 1926 by Carter Godwin Woodson as ***** History Week. The month of February was selected in deference to Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln who were both born in that month."|`|bcde0366c8f72881513022659cf21209aa	I think we should honor all of the african americans that have made positive changes to our society all year round. Having a month stand out for this purpose sheds light and opens eyes to those who think indifferently about people of color. Much of the technology and conveniences we have still today were developed by african americans and it needs to be acknowledged just like anyone else on this planet that has made strides for the human RACE in general. Black history month also tells of the injustices that were done during slavery and the many that stood together to overcome that.|`|ECVm3Zmfaa	To celebrate the great culture and heritage of the African-Americans.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	Darn good question. It's like the people who use the term "people of color". Everyone is a person of color. Black History month  tends to help divide rather than join. What about "Latino History Month" or "Indian History Month"? It should be "History Month" and celebrate EVERYONE.

Q: Why did Tybalt start fighting with Mercutio?   A: Mercutio and Tybalt fought because Tybalt had challenged Romeo to a fight but Mercutio knew that Romeo was not strong enough to fight Tybalt so Mercutio took the burden of fighting Tybalt and eventually dies when he is stabbed by Tybalt under Romeo's arm.    Q: What is the Friar going to do in order to help Romeo and Juliet?  A: He wanted to end the feuding between their families.|`|DvToP5h7aa	Romeo and Juliet.    Act III, Scene i     As often happens in third acts, we find that it is a hot afternoon. Benvolio and Mercutio are hanging out as usual, trading insults and mocking the Capulets. Trouble materializes in the form of Tybalt, who is trying to find Romeo so he can get back at him for crashing the Capulet party.     Mercutio tries to provoke Tybalt. In response, Tybalt insults Mercutio by implying that he and Romeo are gay. "Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo," Tybalt says.     Benvolio, typically, wants everyone to be friends.     Romeo, just married, walks obliviously into the middle of this tense situation. Tybalt calls Romeo a villain, which was a HUGE insult back then.     But Romeo remembers that Tybalt is his new wifes cousin, so he turns the other cheek.    Well, not literally, but he does refuse to fight.     Mercutio is shocked by Romeos behavior  Romeo has totally dishonored himself by taking that insult sitting down.     Mercutio is so upset at Romeos cowardice that he offers to fight Tybalt instead.     FULL ACT & SCENE SUMMARIES:  http://www.shmoop.com/event/literature/w...|`|UtzALxfjaa	1) Because Mercutio said a rude comment. And Tybalt jumped to defend himself with a fight. He was looking for Romeo to fight with him.    2) He's going to give sleeping medication to Juilet to make it 'seem' like she really died, (because of her love for Romeo). And after the funeral, she would wake and Romeo and her would run away together.    3) Because banishing him from his own town is basically deathning, he has no where to go.

Science has discovered that we have sections of our brains dedicated to thoughts about God and thoughts about religious faith.

What I don't know is why these mechanisms don't work in atheists. Whether there is or is not an actual deity is irrelevant to me. I believe because it comes with my wiring.

There is first the mind consciousness--the comprehension of the idea of God. Then follows the soul consciousness--the realization of the ideal of God. Last, dawns the spirit consciousness--the realization of the spirit reality of God. By the unification of these factors of the divine realization, no matter how incomplete, the mortal personality at all times overspreads all conscious levels with a realization of the personality of God.  Page 69-6    In the inner experience of man, mind is joined to matter. Such material-linked minds cannot survive mortal death. The technique of survival is embraced in those adjustments of the human will and those transformations in the mortal mind whereby such a God-conscious intellect gradually becomes spirit taught and eventually spirit led. This evolution of the human mind from matter association to spirit union results in the transmutation of the potentially spirit phases of the mortal mind into the morontia realities of the immortal soul. Mortal mind subservient to matter is destined to become increasingly material and consequently to suffer eventual personality extinction; mind yielded to spirit is destined to become increasingly spiritual and ultimately to achieve oneness with the surviving and guiding divine spirit and in this way to attain survival and eternity of personality existence. Page 26-1|`|UY6c7DG8aa	The bible is telling us what we want to hear, like how there's life after death etc.  And the bible first motivates people to do good with heaven and hell.  And also claims that one must believe in god to be in heaven. So believers may try hard to convince non-believers. And if you betray god, you won't go to heaven.  As simple as that it is so widely believed

AA10729675	He presented himself as the savior of the Republic,  prude, puritanical.  He presented himself as respectuous of the traditions.  But he had spies, and he weakened the senate. So, the senators were doing what he wanted.  The People of Rome had nothing to say.  He also pretended to save the people by creating jobs (the arena, arts, architecture. He embellished the city of Rome which "he found made of bricks and left made of marble). It remains one person in power:  Augustus.  He presented his rule as the only rule there was to save the Republic.

AA12001472	After 1949, Hungary was a Communist state under Soviet influence. Soon, the nation had enough of being oppressed, and there was a nationwide revolt in 1956, when Hungarians demanded freedom and democracy. The Stalinist government fell and was replaced. After a few days, the Soviet Red Army invaded Hungary and crushed the revolution. The West promised support to Hungary, but they didn't give any. About 20000 people were killed in the fighting, and many fled abroad (mainly to the US). There was a wave of sympathy in the West, and a disillusionment with Soviet-style communism.

You will know what's in your heart.    they say 'your heart' instead of 'your mind' because we relate heart to love and so we must know ourselves in order to love ourselves. and if we love ourselves we become an individual and less dependent on belonging and being loved.

oytbZuIkaa	Good point, but unfortunately i do believe that some people are instinctively evil in nature. I dont think that all wrongs can be blamed on ignorance. Although, occasionally ignorance can be involved when someone does something bad, maybe they just didnt realise how bad they were being because they might have a mental disorder that prevents them for realising their behaviour, ie: autism. But i still believe that there is evil out there...|`|G9VBTg47aa	I think Plato or somebody said that ignorance is the only evil, good the only knowledge, however, how that contradicts to my beliefs is another thing. =)|`|FoIxsunVaa	I find a disconnect between "there is no evil" and ignorance.

Evil is a conscious choice between doing something that will help and something that will harm.

Sometimes, knowing that you don't know is the key to minimising bad deeds.|`|fMfBAgOUaa	I agree. For the guy that said "the holocaust was just evil" you are incorrect. Here is how it was ignorance.     Hitler defined the Jews as a race, which is quite incorrect.

Ignorance may be the start of bad behavior and education may be the cure for ignorance and the bad behavior cause by it.    However, once a person has been educated, they now better, and then continue the bad behavior, then it becomes evil or down right wicked.  When you willfully choose to disobey good rules of civil behavior, then you are following the desires of the adversary and have become evil, the opposite of good as exemplified by the Savior.    That which is good cometh of Christ and that which is evil cometh of the devil.  Ignorant misbehavior would not be evil but willful misbehavior is.

DvToP5h7aa	The Iliad  Homer    Hector     Hector is the mightiest warrior in the Trojan army. Although he meets his match in Achilles, he wreaks havoc on the Achaean army during Achilles' period of absence. He leads the assault that finally penetrates the Achaean ramparts, he is the first and only Trojan to set fire to an Achaean ship, and he kills Patroclus. Yet his leadership contains discernible flaws, especially toward the end of the epic, when the participation of first Patroclus and then Achilles reinvigorates the Achaean army. He demonstrates a certain cowardice when, twice in Book 17, he flees Great Ajax. Indeed, he recovers his courage only after receiving the insults of his comradesfirst Glaucus and then Aeneas. He can often become emotionally carried away as well, treating Patroclus and his other victims with rash cruelty. Later, swept up by a burst of confidence, he foolishly orders the Trojans to camp outside Troy's walls the night before Achilles returns to battle, thus causing a crucial downfall the next day.    Full Character Analysis:  http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/iliad/cana...|`|R5UIMBvcaa	To me, Hector is the most admirable character in the Iliad.  He is the best warrior on the Trojan side, but (largely unlike the hero, Achilles) he is also a humane, other-directed leader with a sense of responsibility for his family and his country.  He leads the defense against an invasion caused by his brother's abduction of another man's wife (Helen).  He's also a tender husband and father, as we see in the incident in Book VI when he finds his wife and child on the city wall.    Hector is admittedly not the warrior that Achilles is.  Like the rest of his army, he's even afraid of Achilles. He turns to face and kill the man in Achilles' armor only after Apollo informs him that it's not Achilles but his friend Patroclus, and at the climax, after he has forced himself to stay outside the city to face Achilles, he breaks and runs when Achilles draws near.  The martial prowess that he displays through much of the Iliad is the result of Zeus's using him to fulfill Achilles' prayer that the Trojans be allowed to win for a while so that his own side will see how badly it needs him.  Nevertheless, as the climactic duel between Hector and Achilles is imminent (a duel bound to end in Hector's death), Zeus is tempted to violate even Fate to rescue him.      So the Iliad ends with the line "Thus they buried Hector, tamer of horses."

AA10744471	Theresienstadt ghetto was a German concentration camp which housed more than 60,000 Jews in an area originally designed for only 7,000, thus with this close quarters, diseases and lack of food were dominantly prevailing.    Ghetto Theresienstadt has long been remembered for its culture, its famous prisoners, and its visit by Red Cross officials. What many don't know is that within this serene facade lay a real concentration camp. With nearly sixty thousand Jews inhabiting an area originally designed for only seven thousand -- extremely close quarters, disease, and lack of food were serious concerns. But in many ways, life, and death, within Theresienstadt became focused on the frequent transports to Auschwitz.    The Beginnings    By 1941, conditions for Czech Jews were growing worse. The Nazis were in the process of creating a plan of how to treat and how to deal with Czechs and Czech-Jews. The Czech-Jewish community had already felt pangs of loss and disunion since several transports had already been sent East. Jakob Edelstein, a prominent member of the Czech-Jewish community, believed that it would be better for his community to be concentrated locally rather than sent to the East.    At the same time, the Nazis were facing two dilemmas. The first dilemma was what to do with the prominent Jews that were being carefully watched and looked after by Aryans. Since most Jews were sent on transports under the pretension of "work," the second dilemma was how could the Nazis peacefully transport the elderly Jewish generation.    Though Edelstein had hoped that the ghetto would be located in a section of Prague, the Nazis chose the garrison town of Terezin.    Terezin is located approximately ninety miles north of Prague and just south of Litomerice. The town was originally built in 1780 by Emperor Joseph II of Austria and named after his mother, Empress Maria Theresa. Terezin consisted of the Big Fortress and the Small Fortress. The Big Fortress was surrounded by ramparts and contained barracks. However, Terezin had not been used as a fortress since 1882; Terezin had become a garrison town that remained virtually the same, almost entirely separated from the rest of the countryside. The Small Fortress was used as a prison for dangerous criminals.    Terezin changed dramatically when the Nazis renamed it Theresienstadt and sent the first Jewish transports there in November 1941.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	homework? find your answer in the book "the rise and fall of the third reich"

olahi6esaa	Even now we would beat Russia, Australia, France, Japan and Germany each in a war.   And if were were the size of Russia, our population would still be round about the same. Population growth isn't really determined by the size of a country. Australia is 30 times the size of the UK but has a third of the population.|`|nqcnylFpaa	it would not make a difference because the size of your forces do not matter in war its tactics and weaponry that win a war|`|346683d356126a2c7bdb62721d918419aa	The geographical size of a country or even a greater population compared to another is really not the factors in winning a war.    Look at Israel how small in land size yet it is composed of the world's most deadliest and highly skilled army. Not to mention the highly adept military strategists and technicians.     I believe the reasons a country wins a war is the heart of the people, the cause they support by their military believing it is right, the determination of the country's military and populace to win, the sacrifice people will be making in order to achieve the goal and the military intelligence needed to spy and infiltrate on the enemy.    Example: The sacrifices of the people in U.S., England and U.S.S.R., that had to be made in order to stop the Maniac Hitler and the supporting Axis powers of the time of Japan, Italy and of course Germany.      Peace,     ' J '|`|TexVpUN0aa	It truly would not matter about the size of the the country, but i think i understand the direction you're getting at - if you meant population size, then with the quality of troops currently serving for Britain then it should be possible to emerge victorious from many war's - this is of course has it's complications - Money would be a huge issue, military weaponry, vehicles etc...    But in answer to your question, Asuming you had an endless supply of money, then yes, it is likely that you would win a lot of wars    Howver it must be said - the most major factor in winning a war is most probably Stratagy    (I am going to Exclude Neclear threats in this)
BGU3VpQFaa	Well I think teenage girls should get a little bit of leeway on this even if the obsession is annoying to everybody around them.

A bad writer can make a really original idea into a terrible story, while a really good writer can make a very cliched story into something you want to read over and over again.

She lives an ordinary life with her father, stepmother, and stepbrother. She misses her dead mother terribly. Her father has not been himself since she died. Natalie does not know that her mother had come from another world. One day in the supermarket parking lot, Natalie notices a glimmering wrapper. She has no knowledge that noticing this will lead to her being kidnapped. Natalie's captor knows that she has inherited her mother's power. He wants to force her to join his Spellclave, which will then destroy the magical world Natalie's mother came from, Earthaven. She escapes, aided by her captor's son, Merlin, who is as much a prisoner as Natalie herself is. Together, the two journey to Earthaven, where they discover a world unlike anything they ever imagined. But can they save Earthaven and return to their own world in time? I highly reccomend this enchanting book to readers who enjoy fantasy novels."    "Natalie "Nat" Marlins is the novel's main character. She has blonde hair and green eyes, wears glasses and is said to be pretty. Her mother, the Spell Lady Atanaqui, died when she was three years old. Natalie's father, a jobless salesman, later gets married to Natalie's stepmother Julie, who already has a son called Timothy. Natalie and her stepbrother dislike each other. Julie and Tim left London due to the marriage, so that the family live in an English small town whose name is Millennium Green. Natalie's only friend is Jo Carter, the strongest and tallest girl of their school, where Natalie is often teased due to her visual impairment and perceived as crazy because she owns a spider named Itsy. This animal is kidnapped by Hawk and his followers in order to receive the opportunity to get disposal of Natalie, a plan that eventually fails. During the adventure, Natalie makes friends with the coeval Merlin and K'tanaqui, Lady Atanaqui's hound."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellfall

qdlmy4l8aa	It's societAL problem. Sorry, I couldn't resist.     1. Ignorance and intolerance. They seem to make good bedfellows.    2. Not initially, no; as it is society who demands, and consequently institutes a system of government. Though, it doesn't seem to ameliorate the "ignorance" situation whatsoever. If anything, it condones it.     3. No, but the fact that it keeps afloat by incessant greed doesn't help. If not greed, than lack of prompt service (that one's for the PC people) Who's to blame for that one?     4. Ask Russia.     5. That shouldn't be an "or" question.     I'm 19.

Ow3O7h4caa	Yes it is bad for the simple reasn that yo are removing 200 pounds of pressure on the neck. Their are shims underneath the fingerboard which keeps the neck from twisting and which, the truss rod pushes up or down according to the necessary adjustments.    What happens is that, when you have to strings on the neck, the neck tends to bend slightly backward and the shims fall out of place. When you re-apply the pressure with the strings, sometimes the shims do not get back in their slot properly, What happens is that you may tend to see a bumpy fingerboard eventually.

I'd say the hardest part is getting the sound.  It takes a lot of air, and I often got light-headed when I played it.  The fingering is kind've interesting but I'd say that's not too big an issue.  Make sure to practice lots if you're going to try it out, although I suggest you try something else.  But if you don't have playing tests, solos or something where it's obvious you suck at playing, you could just fake it.

Once you get the hang of blowing it you just have to learn how to move your fingers really really fast!!!! but you should definately try it....it's super fun and easily portable..  Good luck!|`|YYfUzxNzaa	When you begin, yes.  If you're meant for it, though, it will come in a bit.|`|uM0n3N4Jaa	It depends on how soon Marching Band is and the difficulty of pieces they are playing.  If it is in a couple of months and you send a couple of hours a day learning the different scales I think you could be ready to go to marching band and be able to learn the songs the week after you receive them (with lots of practice.)    Also there are usually different flute parts (1st flute, 2nd flute etc.) based on difficulty.    If it is something you really do just go for it.   If you try and it is too much for you then at least you tried.   You have a much better chance of accomplishing the goal by trying than by not.      Jef Kearns  Soul Flute  www.jefkearns.com
6l14p8B9aa	It varies from performance group to performance group, and you may have to go a few times to catch onto their inside jokes and whatnot. Some universal ones are:    - Whenever someone says Brad say "Asshole."  - Whenever someone says Janet say "Slut."  - A personal favorite: during Columbia's tap solo in Time Warp say this in time with her taps: "Two, four, six, eight, show us how you masturbate! Three, five, seven, nine, we know you do it all the time! Eat your heart out Anne Miller! Eat me out Anne Miller! Eat yourself out Anne Miller! Who the **** is Anne Miller?!"  - In the opening credits, when Sue Blane's name appears (she's the costume designer) say "Who's to blame? Sue's to blame!" And every time they say "blame" in the movies say something along the lines of "Read the ******* credits!"  - In the Criminologist's first scene: "I would like," you would, wouldn't you? "to take you" TAKE ME! TAKE ME! "on a strange journey" How strange was it? So strange they made a movie!  - While Frank is introducing himself to Brad and Janet wait for Riff Raff to talk to Frank and say "everything is in readiness blah blah" say "Riff is a gangster!" and he'll say "...word." Say "HOLLA!"    There's an infinite number of variations.    It's very possible to make up your own, but it's very much a matter of trial and error. Be very familiar with the movie and think of possible jokes before trying them out. It is an open movie theater, afterall, and you can shout pretty much whatever you want. It is, however, pretty awkward to spend all the effort shouting a joke and have nobody find it funny.    Generally, performance groups will provide you with prop bags and directions, so they're pretty much fool proof. If you want to bring your own stuff, avoid the hot dogs and buttered toast. Nobody really does them anymore.    Other than that, have fun and don't stress it. :P|`|41dd813bfd40242dc615727b2a55488eaa	Why would you yell ANYTHING in a theater, let alone talk.  Whether it is a film, or live theater you are watching, you shouldn't be talking... shouting... or singing along. Your role as an audience member is to sit there and be entertained. As a fellow audience member, I can assure you that I didn't pay money to listen to YOU sing.. talk... or shout.  I paid to watch a performance, and when YOU talk, sing, or shout, you are creating a disturbance.    As an actor, I can't stand it when a member of the audience decides they need to say something to me in the middle of a performance.  The script doesn't call for a "Question and Answer" session with the audience members...  you are not adding anything to the performance... you are not making me happy... you are being a pain... and I wish I could turn and tell you to shut up... but that would shift the attention from the story line, to the blabber mouth in the audience... so I have to ignore you, and go on with the show.    You should not be talking or shouting during any performance.
AA10729675	There were a lot of themes in this great and long movie:    destiny, loyalty, war, tribal antipathy.  Corruptibility, homosexuality (just a bit of it very discreet).  arrogance. pride, pomp.  delusion.  affection  savagery  leadership  nationalities  diplomacy    All these are epic themes, i.e. themes for an epic like the Iliad.    Try to find an example for each term in the film.
fv7m7bkOaa	dont listen to theater doc he is a douche. all he does is discourage people from acting. why? he failed as an actor and is very bitter. you should take acting classes and get experience from student films and stuff. hey if paul walker can continue to get work anyone can|`|117971b0497cf2c18aa33a272d4e9ec1aa	OK - FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE THE PASSION FOR IT - THAT'S HUGE! DOES THE COLLEGE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A THEATER OR FILM DEPT? IF SO - GET INVOLVED RIGHT AWAY - VOLOUNTEER TO HELP WITH PRODUCTIONS - THEY CAN ALWAYS USE ANOTHER HAND. THIS SUMMER - CHECK OUT YOU R COMMUNITY THEATER IN YOUR AREA. YOU DON'T SAY WHAT CITY/STATE YOU'RE IN - BUT UNLESS YOU ARE IN A REMOTE OR VERY RURAL AREA - THERE IS SOME KIND OF COUNTY OR CITY LOCAL THEATER. - GET AS MUCH EXPERIENCE AS YOU CAN.  IF YOU ARE PLANNING  OF GOING TO SCHOOL IN NY OR LA  ALL THE BETTER AS YOU WILL BE CLOSER TO THE BUSINESS AND AUDITIONS - BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU FROM FOLLOWING YOUR DREAM!  GOOD LUCK!|`|cMu38qfTaa	you may want to think about majoring in acting or theater.  the best way to get an agent is to send out headshots (pictures) of yourself to agencies, telling them that you are seeking an agent. Another good way to go is trying acting classes. My acting instructor was the one who set up an appoitment with the agent im with now. so try to find an acting class to go to maybe online you can find one. i would try to recommend one but it depends on where you live. also, it is VERY ideal that you live in or near LA. i live about 1 1/2 hrs. away so everytime i have an audition i have to go that far and back. so if you live in like the desert than its not really for you hahah. but anyway, if your realy interested, get pictures taken...and you dont have to spend much money on them...you can even have a friend do it or your mom or anybody and then look for an agency or acting class....either way you NEED to go to an acting class even if you are really good at acting because they tell you what to do in an audition and how to be the best you can be. good luck!|`|MNBi0WgDaa	You're great.    It's good that you're thinking about other jobs. Acting's tough, and we have to have a back up plan.    Going to classes for film is a start. Also, get an agent. Once you have that, just being a good actor will be enough! =]    Good luck!|`|Mig6O93Naa	Yeah. If you do anything other than devote your entire life to acting you will not become an actor. You cannot be 'willing to be dedicated' you have to already be dedicated. You canot  think you are quite good at it, you have to be fantastic at it. Go be a nurse, at least you will earn a living, few actors do.

Edward tells Bella that a vampire cannot kill themself this way, but starvation will make them weak.|`|Il0sobKDaa	they can't starve themselves unless thay are completely away from blood. (in something they can't get out, which is unlikely for these vampires). if they go too long without blood, they get really thirsty and can't control themselves from eating any blood filled thing they are around. i know. its a great book! i have my grandma and lil ten year old sister reading it and then my mom takes me to the movies to watch it! it rocks! (i am reading it again, for the third time. the whole series!) if you liked the twilight series, you should also try reading the "Vampire Academy" series by Richelle Mead! Her  books are (in my opinion) as good as the twilight books. can't choose between them! but there are more books by Richelle Mead but they are a little perverted...unlike twilight and vampire academy! i am a little obssesed and talk to much so i will leave you alone! have fun with you Vampire knowledge!|`|g7gH4geLaa	I don't know what would happen hm...............|`|PGCswWFpaa	They go insane and they'll probably just lose control and go and hunt.

Otherwise go to this side, it has a twilight lexicon = http://www.twilightlexiconblog.com/|`|kJrU5nYsaa	Well in the first book edward said that Carlisle wa trying to avoid what he was after he knew what he had turned into.  So I suppose that after a period of time, the animal instincts would take over, and then they would be forced to feed because of their animal instincts|`|P68rfGiyaa	i think that they wouldeventually die because of weakness or be driven to drink but its cool you finished ive been reading for 3 weeks and im starting eclipse tonight|`|bun3Nq3kaa	the only thing  twilight had about starving is when Carlisle was disgusted with  himself and tries to starve himself until he found a better solution(animal blood).  book-twilight  ch-16  -Carlisle|`|qs1NMpXQaa	I read all the books 3 times...im completely obsessed haha =] I never get tired of the twilight series. Ok well for your question...they dont directly explain what would EXACTLY happen to them. But you can infer/kinda guess that if they go a very long time with out drinking an animals or humans blood their eyes change color. They turn from gloden bronze to dark black. They Develop purple circles under their eyes and are in a grumpy mood ( edward sometimes gets like that ) Also, i read the first 12 chapters of Midnight Sun ( in edwards point of view instead of Bella's ) and i read that the longer they go with out drinking, the more tempting human blood becomes to them. Especially Jasper!!|`|lSw7NHFXaa	they dont i reccommend read the series again it rox!|`|nlbJAtuZaa	they dont have to eat food but if they starve themselves from blood they die i think|`|FLfmkNEAaa	This question has been asked please look it up it is annoying to see the same questions over and over and over and over again please stop right now. CONGRATULATIONS YOU WASTED 5 POINTS|`|OZbZPNTtaa	hmm welli guess it would be reallly uncomfortable, like if humans were starving we would be "in pain" and the vampires are"in pain" in their throat|`|sJlyZyOWaa	I don't think it said so in the books. I assume that they can't. They will probably go on a rampage and kill the nearest humans they can find when their will can't hold out any longer.|`|8bedd8c5d340a0aef2f82dd7f2f521f3aa	They grow weak. Haven't you ever paid attention to Carlisl's story? Sorry if i spelt it wrong lol. (:|`|QkmoNX2Qaa	Well,   they would just become bloodthirsty, and starved, hungry for blood.       They may kill some-one, it depends how starved they were. Especially Jasper as he's the newest member. But Carlisle prob wouldn't. He'd just go hunting for animals|`|zFGrP2ITaa	they would like go CRAZY and kill everyone|`|af43e8f6af5feac294cdbceeba67f982aa	In the first book there is a some part that talkes about how Carlise trying to kill himself.  Vampires can only die one way, to be torn apart and then burned.  The thrist would take over and drive them to become killing machines until they where not longer thristy.|`|XTGyYwNUaa	I frigen hate TWILIGHT, its annoys me so much:) i never understood the hype about vampires and humans interacting. It is not realistic and makes girls goo crazy, what is with society of authors writing these nonsense books? ughhh makes mee so annoyed&pissed off.|`|PwXc3pHxaa	Carlisle acually answered it in the first book. He said he tried to starve himself when he had found out what he had become, remember? He had starved himself because he  dint want to hurt anyone. So he was hiding out in the forest so one night a herd of deer came past and his instincts took over. Thats also how he found out he could be a "vegetarian". So to make a long story short after a while of the vampires starving themselves, they cant really control themselves and they drink the first thing of blood they can find, in this case a deer. I really hope this helps!:):):)|`|26ygzBVkaa	Umm it would probably be uncomfortable. Like Carlisle when he first became a vampire he hide and didnt eat anything. But then a animal ran by him and he was so hungry he drank its blood.

f4Nn0W1xaa	Well, of course it's not impossible. Pretty much anything has a thesis, really. I'm just not sure what you're asking. It sounds to me like you want to tell people that moving out on one's own is difficult (thesis) and you want to support that by explaining your experience. You can expand on that to some degree but unless I'm missing something huge here that's pretty much it.

SSmM05guaa	Just avoid handing it out to a stingy person (no offense to the stingy people). Give it to a best friend or sibling, or just copyright it so nobody can steel it. And if you can't do that, type a contract saying that the book belongs to you and have them sign it. Then if they try to steel it, show them the contract. Good luck!|`|RzbRRUOdaa	If you don't really have people whom you can trust a hundred percent, then the best way to go is to get a copyright for your story.    I also suggest that you try to set your manuscript aside for a while and then go back to it later and do some self-editing.  Here's how you can do it:  http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.c...    I hope you find this useful.|`|NlvTdPvRaa	http://www.copyright.gov/    Just follow the directions|`|UtzALxfjaa	You can never trust someone fully.

Once it it copy|`|TG7mwNRfaa	Before you hand it out to anyone, snail mail it to yourself. When you get it back in the mail, DON'T OPEN IT. The postmarked date will prove that you wrote it before that date (as long as you don't open it!) and no one else will be able to say that they wrote it before you.|`|245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	First of all, whatever happened with Meyer's "Midnight Sun" happened because Meyer is a best selling author who apparently doesn't have very good friends.    You are not published, though. So the chances that someone will try and publish your work are minimal. I can't say the same for flat-out plagiarism; somebody *could* take your idea.    My suggestion would be to hand it out only to the people you trust beyond reason. This could be your parents, best friend, English teacher, etc. But don't hand it out to people you don't trust. If there are people who you think might just try to be nice and say "it's good" without giving some actual opinions, cross them off the hand-out list, too. It would save trees :)|`|GwFKW4Wsaa	Im really not sure about this but ill throw a few ideas out there...    Possibly write up a mini contract (so to speak) and write that they are unable to use any of the ideas in the manuscript and get it signed by a Justice of the Peace, which is a legal term for a witness and tell them its standard procedure in the "book world". This way you have something signed titling your work and the fact they cant steal ideas etc    Just a thought, great question!!|`|peEYTDY3aa	hey i'd love to read ur story!! haha wats it about?? well dont give it to anyone b4 u copyright itt!!!|`|OjQxKGC0aa	Most writers don't show their work to people they don't trust. They show it to family and friends, members of their critique group, respected literary agents, and respected editors at respected publishing houses. In 99.9% of cases, these people do not steal manuscripts. That's why most writers do not submit their work for an official copyright before it's published.     Your work is yours as soon as you put it on paper. This means you own the copyright. You can also obtain an official copyright through the Library of Congress for a small fee. However, most traditional publishers don't like writers to do that, because it complicates things when the book is submitted for copyright before publication.     The less official copyright is enough to protect you provided you can prove you wrote your work before someone else copied it. This is another good reason why writers should have a critique group. They can attest that your work is your work and when you wrote it.     One more thing about copyright: you should know that titles and ideas cannot be copyrighted, only the way they're expressed can be. A title can be trademarked, like Harry Potter, but that's an entirely different thing, and it costs a lot more. Trademarks are for companies. Copyrights are for books.    Added on: mailing the manuscript to yourself is called a "poor man's copyright" and it's not admissable evidence in a court of law.    Additional add on: asking people to sign a contract before reading your manuscript is a sure sign on an amateur. No legitimate editor will agree to read a manuscript under such circumstances. Considering only one in 10,000 manuscripts are accepted for publication, you don't want to give them a reason to reject your manuscript without even reading it.|`|Kkt8NiwMaa	You wrote a book?

To transpose from Bb to C, you must play a whole step (or 2 half steps) higher to match the C on a piano.    "Ami" is short for a minor triad and is comprised of a-c-e.    "D7" is short for a D (major) Seventh chord (D-F -A-C). Do not confuse it with "DM7" which would be a D Major Seventh chord and it includes D-F -A-C . A "Dm7" is a D Minor Seventh chord and the notes are D-F-A-C.    Kabum

ZIJvBQAMaa	Answer: Tell your teacher that you are too lazy to do your own homework and went to Yahoo Answers for your research. :)|`|2BmGwbvYaa	Louis David Riel (22 October 1844  16 November 1885, pronounced /?lu?i ri???l/ in English) was a Canadian politician, a founder of the province of Manitoba, and leader of the Mtis people of the Canadian prairies. He led two resistance movements against the Canadian government and its first post-Confederation Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald. Riel sought to preserve Mtis rights and culture as their homelands in the Northwest came progressively under the Canadian sphere of influence. He is regarded by many as a Canadian folk hero today.    The first resistance was the Red River Rebellion of 18691870. The provisional government established by Riel ultimately negotiated the terms under which the modern province of Manitoba entered the Canadian Confederation. Riel was forced into exile in the United States as a result of the controversial execution of Thomas Scott during the rebellion. Despite this, he is frequently referred to as the "Father of Manitoba". While a fugitive, he was elected three times to the Canadian House of Commons, although he never assumed his seat. During these years, he was frustrated by having to remain in exile despite his growing belief that he was a divinely chosen leader and prophet, a belief which would later resurface and influence his actions. He married in 1881 while in exile in Montana, and fathered two children.    Riel returned to what is now the province of Saskatchewan to represent Mtis grievances to the Canadian government. This resistance escalated into a military confrontation known as the North-West Rebellion of 1885. It ended in his arrest, trial, and execution on a charge of high treason. Riel was viewed sympathetically in francophone regions of Canada, and his execution had a lasting influence on relations between the province of Quebec and English-speaking Canada. Whether seen as a Father of Confederation or a traitor, he remains one of the most complex, controversial, and ultimately tragic figures in the history of Canada.|`|8tYKGDy0aa	lol

It's all about knowing how to use the mid control - at the extremes its not as useful, but that mid boost/cut feature is one of the most powerful you can have in terms of distortion - you can get anything from thrash to death to Recto-esque... from Metallica to Slayer to Cannibal Corpse.    You just have to watch the gain. Don't have it up too high, or you run the risk of obscuring your tone and adding a lot of noise.

If you want to go up a half step, go on the 6th fret on the Low E, and make it sound like the A string when holding the 6th fret on the E string(Like your self tuning it. Drop the E string down to it. If you want to go up a half step do the same thing but instead of using the 6th fret use the 4th. Once the E string is in tune, you can self tune the guitar like you normally would.|`|aw2xkdSbaa	or, spend $15 on a chromatic tuner!

But you should also feel free to keep writing without knowing what your title is -- lots of books weren't named until finished, and some even had the names changed after that.

Think of what your book means or what it is saying to your readers and if you can describe it in one or more words then that is what your title should be. Just make it special and original.

yjmIrlYeaa	aunt alexandria sees(like most people back then) a lady as someone who is in the social circles, wears dresses and doesn't wear ripped overalls and plays in the sand (which is what Scout does)  when she has that tea party or whatever it was, she makes Scout wear a dress and she's really into manners    one of the reasons why she went to their house was to teach her how to act that way since Scout doesn't have a mom      Miss Maudie is very lady-like, polite  i don't really know what to say about her      Calpurnia teaches the children manners as well, acts kinda like their mother, and has practically raised them.      i don't feel like looking for quotes but i remember when some were happening    like an Aunt Alexandria one was when she was speaking to Atticus and telling him that he should enforce her 'laws" too since he's okay with the way Scout is    but Aunt Alexandria is more into what the people think|`|zBFPEjDdaa	Aunt Alexander yells at Atticus for not being "a girl" and how shes disrespectful, and she learn to be a young laddy|`|Bt5m6jVTaa	Sorry for not answering your question, but is that a good book?

Stardust  Neverwhere  American Gods  Good Omens    and so forth.|`|AA10453678	Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen.    It is my new favorite book. The story was so rich and detailed.

I would suggest you read the Night World Series by L.J.Smith.  Its a really good series.(700 and some pages long.)    If you don't want to read that then try reading the series Blue Bloods by Melissa De La Cruz. (It is 302 pages long.)    If you don't like them my last recomdation is the Artemis Fowl Series.|`|pDvFwWujaa	Oh... tough one, thinking at an advanced 7th grade reading level... mmm... Definitely know how you feel. I've been reading Stephen King since age 11.     Ok.     Just Listen, by Sarah Dressen- kind of a teen drama, dealing with rape's effects on the social life and mind, anorexia, and the "never judge a book by it's cover" theme. I read that in grade 9. It's a rather easy read with a nice story.. well... through some parts, anyway.    To Kill a Mockingbird. Oh, yes. Good message in that one.    A Child Called It, by Dave Pelzer- So, so sad. I cried.     The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but those take forever to read... so not for school, I wouldn't do that.    I WILL suggest Harry Potter. I read Chamber of Secrets in 3 days when in grade 7. They're huge, yes, but they go so fast.     Can't think of anything else at the mo'..:)    But I DEFINITELY suggest Just Listen.

Harry Potter is amazing. If or when you read it, it will be the best books you'll ever read. You should seriously try them sometime.     Moving on,    Holes - Louis Sachar (Or something like that. It's been a while.):P    Where the Red Fern Grows - (Not for sure.)    Those are a couple books I remember LOVING when I was in 7-8th grade. "The Giver" was amazing! I read it twice. :P    I would recommend others, but I've mostly read adult books. I didn't really start reading avidly until 11th grade. :S      EDIT: Yes, I forgot about "The Hunger Games". I read it last year. It was BRILLIANT. It is much like "The Giver" although it isn't a sort of Utopian community. North America has been split into 12 districts (13 but one rebel and got destroyed) and each year the districts have to have a boy and girl from each to compete in "The Hunger Games". They have to fight for their life; the winner will be rewarded with a comfortable life. They others, well, die. It's a sort of sick game the Governments makes the districts play to make known that THEY are in control and the districts can do nothing about it.|`|7Ggc5bqEaa	I highly recommend the series of The Protector of the Small by Tamora Pierce. There's four books in the series.  It's about a girl, starting at age 10 wanting to become a knight. (It's a fantasy. Back in the medieval times.)  She is on probation as a first year page. (She's the only girl, they didn't want to let her join)  Than after her four years as a page the books lead to her as a squire and becoming a knight.    It's a very addictive series and there's a little of everything. I don't feel like summarizing the whole series, I don't want to accidental spoil anything but I really recommend them.   Look it up on the web to get more info on them!    Happy reading!|`|E9KYlG9kaa	I absolutely love The Yearling by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and I'm very picky too!  It's thick and I read it in like 7th grade.  If you like nature or animals, you will love it too!|`|9vCLgQHIaa	I just read a book called Blood and Chocolate by Annette Curtis Klause. One of the best books i've ever read. I've read quite a lot too. But i started reading it just last night and today, all together like 4 or 5 hours it took me to finish this book. So good. It's about a girl who's around 16, her dad died in a fire, she's a werewolf and she moves to Maryland. She discovers a human guy and falls in love with him and she doesn't know what she really is, a human or a beast. (I took most of that from the back and put it in my own words)    Also Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins was majorly good. Like ginormously good. Couldn't put it down either. Finished it in a day.

This has helped me enormously.  And plenty of practice on spare paper.

Some choreographers hear music and can come up with something on the spot. Some have to sit down and think about it. Others take inspiration from anything, without even hearing any music. Others use a beat or and 8-count. I think you get the picture.     The best way I found to choreograph when I started out a few years ago is to think about who you are choreographing for. That may sound totally obvious, but is the most commonly overlooked point.     Is it for yourself? If so, what are your strengths and weaknesses? If it's for a group - how can you combine the skills of everyone in that group and produce something awesome?     A great idea is to use other members of the group - get them to pick a song or a step and get it going from there. If the choreography is just for yourself - get inspired. Hit up YouTube for videos, or tape yourself just freestyling and see what you get from that.     I'm a professional choreographer, so feel free to send me any ideas you got or ask me for any more help. I'd love to help you out.     Good luck     Mac

HgdQMWuDaa	On that date in 2012 we will be aligned with the center of the galaxy for the first time in 6,450 years.  This one however, will be the dawn of the age of Aquarius after the 25800 year cycle.  The age of pisces was the previous, and is represented in the bible with the fishes for Christ which began 2150 years ago, because the symbol for pisces is two fish which is why the symbolism is so adundent in regards to fish (We only have five loaves of bread and TWO FISH- Matthew 14-17).    In the 25800 year cycle, every one of the twelve astrological constellations is represented, however the order moves backwards from our normal monthly astrological signs.  This is why Moses in the old testament after finding the people worshiping the bull, asked them to kill one another because that was the end of the age of taurus represented by the bull.  Moses represented aries the ram, which is why Jews blow ram horms.  This is also why Mythra killed the bull at about the same time as well.  The next era of aquarius will be represented by a water barer.  Also the King James bible was mistranslated in many ways.... Jesus never mentioned in the original king james in hebrew... I will be with you to the end of the WORLD... the word translated from hebrew to english was Aeon meaning age not world... so Matthew 28-20 Actually means I will be with you to the end of the age of pisces.    basically 2012 is just the time when we are aligned with the center of the galaxy again and the beginning of the new age.... nothing more thats why all these ancient calenders stop. no end of the world... end of the aeon or age..    this could potentially change the north south polarity to a south north polarity of the earth which happens with they alignment, and it is due for it to happen again. we do not know how long this polarity shift will take, probably a few hundred years, which will have virtually no side effects, but if it were to happen in the course of a year or shorter this could potentially cause all kinds of eathquakes.  however, it is highly higly unlikely it will happen this way so we need not worry, no legitimate scientist thinks there will be any problems with the polarity shift.     there is no bullshit acid tripping or talking to animals or telepathic communication.... my goodness people are lame... its purely an astrological event... i'm sure many thousands of people just wish their life had some kind of meaning to it and love to fantacize about things like that but it is absolutely horenduously scarily embarassing that people believe such things.... or the end of the world, as if it would happen in a moment and not from nuclear winter, or the collision with the andromeda galaxy or the big rip of the universe after we are a molten rock from the sun's expansion. the earth will most likely be around another 45 billion years until the universe falls apart from not being able to expand, and  will contract in an instant destroying everything and nothing will remain in a few thousand years after this happens (the universe is huge).... humanity will be long gone by this time at least on this planet along with all earth's life.  first too hot then far too cold.    also there is no planet nibiru or whatever they call it that haunts the solar system and will come back and destroy us on that date.  which is what some of the 2012 theorists believe. the pictures they claim to have are actually of another nearby star.... don't believe any of that either... i would go into detail but i have said enough for now    millenarianism has been around since about 500 ad.... every hundred years or big astrological event a percentage of the population believes the world will end, its no different this time, just something for people to enjoy conspiracy theories about, it's nuts. no worries.|`|iYoCZVpmaa	PEople think that the world will end in 2012 because the Mayan calendar ends in 2012. which means that, people think it's the end of the world because the Mayan Calendar ends in that time.  there is also a movie called 2012 coming out this year.   maybe you should go watch the trailer to find out more.|`|B5Fm455paa	I blame the history channel.|`|lmXlZHIbaa	Looney! lets take a look back 1999. Y2k nothing happened i ended up missing one of my college classes for that.|`|AA11440601	I have not met one person who really believe this.    One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world.    These predictions are scare tactics, conspiracy theories, and chances to make money from books and movies.    Ever since the Y2K and 6/6/6 (June 6, 2006) End of the World scenarios did not pan out, the scare mongers, conspiracy theorists, book sellers, and television executives have been touting the 2012 End of the World scenario. When 2012 does not happen either, I am sure they will think of something else.    "But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be watchful! Be alert! You do not know when the time will come." (Mark 13:32-33)    Jesus told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to know when the end of the world would come but that we were always to be ready.    The early Christian Church thought that Jesus was going to return at any moment. Only after a couple of centuries did the Church realize that it may be 2,000 or 4,000 or 8,000 years before Jesus returns.    The Catholic Church wisely follows Jesus' advice and teaches that each of us should live as if we will meet our maker in the next ten minutes and that we need to work to make the world a better place for our 100 X great-grandchildren.    Do not worry about the end of the world. Trust God to make sure everything happens to plan. Just be ready to meet God at any time.    For more information, about what Catholics believe about the end of the world, see: http://www.americancatholic.org/Newslett...

Russia and Iran gang up on Israel,start a war, USA keep out of it,(here's the weird bit) there appears on the scene a peace maker,but it turns out the man of peace is in fact The Antichrist.

But Mayan scholars have found this to be a misinterpretation. No data has been found on the "end of the world" in the calendar. Scholars say it will only mark the beginning of a new era for the Mayans. Much like today's calendar for New Year's Day. But new age leaders have marked Dec. 21, 2012 to be a beginning of human consciousness, meaning that we will secrete a substance in our pituitary gland that will naturally make us more psychic and cause hallucinations due to a rapid switch in the north and south poles. They suspect that some who have not worked out there spiritual guilt,sins, etc. will have a hard time coping and will most likely die. But those who will live through it will acheive a higher state of consciousness. thx.

XLRx5decaa	His hair grows to be unruly.     "All right, we told you we could blame Ralph's moments of savagery on his hair. Well, we were lying. What we meant to say was that Ralph's hair was a symbol for his growing savagery. That shaggy mop eventually has a life of its own. The narrative always makes a point of telling us that it's in Ralph's face, that he wishes he could cut it, that it makes him feel dirty and uncivilized. We know the hair has to be a big deal because the very first words of the novel are, "The boy with fair hair lowered himself down..." Getting your hair cut is one of the perks of civilization, many of which Ralph and the others have had to give up. It also reminds us that the boys have been on the island for quite a while now; this is no mere weekend getaway. Lastly, there's something horribly disturbing about his hair just growing, growing, with no way to stop it and the assumption that it will simply go on forever, much like the boys' growing violence and the increasingly savage occurrences on the island.|`|DvToP5h7aa	Characters and Their Involvement in 'Lord of the Flies'    The following are descriptions of all the main characters in the novel.

AA10256080	I know that it is politically correct in our times to refer to slavery in the figurative context of the evil Simon Lagree twirling his mustache, beating slaves, and making millions of dollars from this free labor pool.  However, such a belief doesnt reflect reality.  Slavery was anything but free labor, particularly in North America.    First there was the capital investment of purchasing slaves which was higher in North America than any other country using slave labor.  Purchasing should also include the cost of raising slaves from births from owned slaves.  The mother could not work while in the later stages of pregnancy and the child cost money to raise to adulthood where they could be worked or sold.  Then there was the maintenance of the slaves, food, clothing, housing, training, and the care of the aged as they became non-productive.      This investment was large and that is why only a minority of the population of slave holding States maintained slaves.  The slave holder may have been considered wealthy but a significant portion of that wealth was a capital investment of the slave.  Then too there was a capital investment in land that only had worth if it could be worked, and at that time that agricultural land was worked only by very labor intensive methods.    Other than the Gin Mill, industrialization had not yet come to plantation operations and profitability could only be realized through the application of intensive labor practices.  Even so, there were he beginnings of dialog concerting what many far thinkers believed to be that coming industrialization.  The question then was, how to move the invested capital in slaves into new techniques and what to do with the slaves.  This was a major challenge.  One such possible answer was to begin transferring the slave population to future investments in other labor intensive agricultural operations in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.  Of course the American War of the 1860s ended such considerations with the Union taking over the South through military conquest and freeing the slaves and thereby doing a form of wealth transfer through that military conquest and subsequent occupation.    It is most likely, that during the next 20 to 30 years, the pressure from the European cotton and tobacco customers, the advent of new agricultural industrialization, and the use of share cropping, slavery would have disappeared from the Southern United States with no war at all.    Of course, such a possibility would not have stopped the war because although slavery became an issue within the war, it was not the cause.  If it was the cause then the war would never have occurred because with secession the slavery 'problem' was removed from the Union.  President Lincoln would not accept the Constitutional legitimatcy of secession because the union needed the tax revenues from the Southern States as well as the business (such as shipping) that the Northern States made from such agricultural products.      Lincoln was only able to do this by using incorrect and clearly false interpretations of the Constitution, its founding, and the intent of the Founders.  His incorrect position was clearly presented in his 14 July 1861 message to Congress.    That war and the 660,000 dead was needlessly initiated by the Union grasping for power and money.|`|xQwU590Laa	money.  They made their living thru slave labor.|`|AA12095483	Why should they? They thought it was a great system, it was very cheap (they didn't have to pay their workers) and as the slaves had children, there was always a supply of new workers.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	If they had to pay their help, cotton and other agricultural products would have been priced out of the market.

Many slave owners truly believed the propagandist teachings that white people were genetically superior to African Americans. Biblical references supposedly supported a divine right to rule over black people, and scientific journals released convincing reports that show physical impairments in African Americans that made them inferior to Whites. Some white people convinced themselves that their dominance over Blacks was actually a benevolent act of caretaking, like parents to control unruly children that can't help themselves.       The other side of white resistance to emancipation was that having Black slaves was great for the economy. Slaves were free labor with no rights, farmers could work them as hard and as long as they wanted. They could also be used as a sexual distraction for men without any concern over responsibility of unwanted pregnancies. While white slave owners continued to control African Americans, they lived lives of relative luxury and ease, and it was a pleasant lifestyle they were in no hurry to give up.    Take these into account|`|7Xfoa8Ziaa	What, and work themselves?!?!?|`|XJXsFn9paa	The answer to this question is also the answer to the question "Why do bankers become bankers?"

That's why they all went bankrupt at the end of the Civil War.|`|SiSplXXsaa	Because it was profitable; America wouldn't be so rich of a country were it not for free slave labour.|`|47c479f2304b0788f9cb6367693718d5aa	Oh where to start.  First of all slavery is as old as civilization itself.  Yet it was suddenly proclaimed evil.  Yeah it was proclaimed evil a good 100 years before the civil war in some places but it is still today, accepted in some places.    Second it is defined in the  Bible, the Torah and the Koran.  The rules are set out for it in all three books.  So again, where is it stated that it is evil?  Third, in non slave states and countries, the rules of employment are very much like the rules of slavery. the responsibilities of the employed are the same as the responsibilities of the slave in regard to his performance for the empolyer-master. The only difference is "Employment at will" So again, where is the evil?  As for the money, the rules of economics again slavery reflects employment.  The slave owner actually had a higher responsibility for his slaves than did an employer for his workers.  So again! where was the evil.  and lastly, the south was not fighting for slaves.  Most of the south could not have cared any less about some plantation owners problems.  They were fighting for states rights.  In fact they were fighting FOR the US constitution.  Far more than was the north.  Please don't take this as a defense of slavery. I am just answering the question.|`|d8cdaa6ac0fd944307130584525d1a48aa	Because it was still considered legal, acceptable, and normal. Once something has been accepted by a society, and has proven to work it's hard to get out of that mindset. They were able to have workers do work without having to pay them.|`|1MMIwkfsaa	Because it was in their financial interests to continue slavery.  Slave traders only care about their own pockets because they are greedy rats, they could'nt care less about human suffering just like modern day sex slave traders, pirates, and dumb gangsters who would kill their granny for a few quid and yet are glamourised by even dumber film makers.

If you want her to truly be able to help you, and to understand you and the issues you have, give the one that means the most to you, or that you wrote when you were feeling worst/the way you do most often.  Do not value the poem on its writing, but rather on its meaning.  They are both fine poems, and you are talented, but that's not the point.
RoqxGbgRaa	1) a-b-c-b rhyme scheme  2) assonance-time, kindly, eyes (all use the long i sound)  3)  softly sinks--alliteration repeated s-sound  4)  definite rhythm in the poem, which is kicked off with the repeated k-sound in the first two words  5) imagery--softly sinking sun in the west  6)  symbolism-sun (life), west (sunset, death)    this poem seems to me to be about the passing nature of life.  "look back on time" and "human nature's west" both refer to death.     there is also an air of fragility or weakness about the dying person: "his trembling sun"--his trembling, weakening, fading life
d267fab7a0b268922f3228351f52baf1aa	I think it would be cool to have her be gay all along but no one really asked her and she never had to properly address the issue.    ---  As a youngster family says 'ahh aren't they cute' or 'don't you think he's handsome' but they don't really expect at 11 and 12 for you to be in love.  By preteen you're awkward so family would chalk it up to shy and again they do all your speaking so you'd get over.  Even early teens when you're friends are all 'isn't he cute' they ignore if you don't find any guys adorable because something is usually wrong with them, he can't dress, his hair is greasy, he smells funny, eats like a pig, dated a nemesis, has awful grades which will make your group act like they don't mind you not being into him.  Having females on your walls in your room look like your 'heroes' and not your sexual preference.    ---  So it would be funny if some guy kept at her about it and finally says 'what are you gay?'  and she's like yeah and what?|`|wYF6U6qlaa	I think both could be really interesting.  I would be more apt to read whichever is the most genuine.  What do you want to say with this piece?     Maybe you should choose the one you know most about - if you're gay (or a friend, or whoever is the source for your reference) and you've been gay for many years and you've become very comfortable with your lifestyle, then have your character start off gay.   But if you had a tumultuous time coming out, or you were very well-supported by your friends and loved ones, or you wavered between possibilities for a long while and you feel that that experience was a big part of how you see yourself as a gay person, then have your character experience a similar transition.|`|0WKkXIyKaa	gay from the start i would say.

But I would say do what your imagination tells you. But I think it would be fun to step out from the crowd and write something a bit different that way people will be drawn to it more. Maybe you could start the character out as confused...she doesn't know what she is. That way she has some room for everything. Good Luck and I hope everything works out :-)
Bgqi0pOuaa	Wow, this is brilliant.    A long time ago, Mattel came under fire because one of their Barbie toys said "Math is hard" (among other things) when you pulled the string.  People were up in arms because it sent a negative stereotype about girls not being good at math.    This female author is saying math is hard sarcastically because she used to overanalyze all the word problems.  She'd use a tremendous amount of logic on them.  Like, why does the boy have to spend all 2 dollars at the store?  Can't he get a purse to keep the change in?  Why does one guy move slower than his neighbor?    You ever get word problems like this and say to yourself, "I don't give a crap about Mr. Brown and how long his fence is!"?  She's thinking about math in this way, not because she doesn't get it.  She's probably too intelligent to be confined by it.    She goes on to share how she broke other stereotypes of girls, using Barbies more the way boys use their action figures--for violence, etc.    A great piece that attempts to break down the girly stereotypes.  It evokes memories of Dar Williams' song "When I Was a Boy".  If you don't know it, look it up--another masterpiece on this subject.

Good luck =)|`|QYPrM3GPaa	God was never created.  The human mind is not capable of understanding this.  Its an age old question with no answer.  It is the same kind of question as:    What is Truth?  What is Nothing?    There are a whole group of questions we ask ourselves we are not capable of comprehending or understanding, and this one you ask is that kind of question.      Just to put things into perspective - Planet Earth is a tiny spec of dust that sits in a planetary system which itself is a tiny spec of dust in a gigantic galaxy called the milky way.  The distance across the galaxy is 100,000 light years and there are approximately 300 billion stars in this galaxy alone.  The next closest galaxy to us is Andromeda and it is 3 million light years away.  It is estimated that the universe contains at least 200 - 300 billion such galaxies spread across a vast universe so big that there appears no end to it.  The age of the universe is about 14 billion years old (astronomers now estimate).  The age of the earth and our planetary system is 4.5 billion years old.  Presuming that the Big Bang happened, that was 14 billion years ago.  And according to Einstein, the universe will some day collapse upon itself back to a single point with everything contained in it as it was the moment of this Big Bang.  Now if that is true, you have to ask yourself the question - IS THIS THE FIRST TIME?  It is estimated by cosmologists currently, that the universe will wink out and die in a couple of TRILLION years - some think it will not collapse, but I think so.    So if you get the picture, you see that the universe could be just going through one of an endless number of Big Bang cycles...sort of like breathing in and out.  Perhaps this has been going on for eternity. Perhaps each cycle is a couple of TRILLION YEARS.  Perhaps it has happened a million billion trillion quadrillion times.  Over and over and over again.    Cosmologists cannot get beyond just a fraction of a second of time of THIS Big Bang occurance. And they never will...they cannot go back to a time which they have no reckoning of.    Now - Think of God in all of this.  Do you think you can comprehend something which happened 14 billion years ago that happens every 2 trillion years which has occurred a million billion trillion quadrillion times?    I am thinking it was so long ago, it is meaningless - it has no definition - and even God does not remember that far back.  Besides, when there is ONLY God and nothing else, then there is nothing ELSE to compare to, right?  So what is time then?  Time, is meaningless in that context.    So from God's perspective (see this as God would see it, ok?)...time does not exist.  Time is an illusion.  Everything that ever was, is or will be is always RIGHT NOW.  This is called an absolute reference.  God was never ceated becuse God is all that there is and ever has been.|`|Fjlb40Yvaa	GOD created human beings....as its best creation...!!  He created everything in Universe...The Animal are the one who have many thing but not the ability of thinking and analysing ...  But GOD created Human being with the great capability of thinking and analysing.....So If u r a human being which i guess u r then think in the right direction....logically and personally when u notice ur surrounding the sky, the moon, the sun..the wind ,the water...The best to look inside ur body how ur body works is amazing ....it is not that it formated automatically ..if u think logically then u will realize that there is a Great INvisible power who is controlling everything...  We can't see HIM but surely we can feel HIM....try to see the Universe knowing that there is A Power nd then u wouldn't have such a illogical question dear!     Yess One thing God does not permit us to think abt him....becoz HE is beyond our IMagination. ..Here we are not able to analyse ourself how come we can discover the creation of GOD....We can't and we don't have to wast time in doing so...JUST ANALYSE the Universe around urself and U can feel the ALMIGHTY....!!

The basic principle of Satanism is that "Satan" is the aspects of human nature that the Christian church vilified (sexuality, curiosity, ambition, independence). Satanists worship these ideals because they believe that there is nothing higher than the natural state of man.     Here is a quote from The Satanic Bible: "The devils of past religions have always, at least in part, had animal characteristics, evidence of man's constant need to deny that he too is an animal, for to do so would serve a mighty blow to his impoverished ego."    I really suggest picking up The Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey. Its an incredibly well-written and smart book. More philosophy than religion.
70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	The truth is complicated as the seat which Caesar Augustus held. In fact, there was no constitutional office of "Emperor", the word itself comes from the Latin word "imperator" which simply means "commander in chief". The use of the word emperor is simply a shorthand for the numerous powers which the heirs of Augustus held in the Imperial era. It was very much an informal rank, and the official title of Augustus was "princep", which translates to "first among equals". It was a collection of many offices including Consul, Censor, and pontifex maximus. He was also the Princeps Senatus, or first senator, possibly similar to the modern title of prime minister. Emperors also held the title of Tribunitia Potestas, which was the powers invested in a tribune including the power of veto in the senate and the power to prosecute anyone who interfered with his administrative duties. His title of Imperator granted him the supreme leadership of the army. In addition, all emperors were the private owners of the province of Egypt, the breadbasket of the Empire and its major source of food, which granted him a tremendous amount of political power.     Because of the unofficial nature of the position of emperorship, the significance of the senate was wholly dependent upon the whims of the Emperor. However, early in the principate the senate still possessed considerable power, and unpopular emperors such as Caligula or Nero could find themselves in danger of being assassinated. Therefor, Augustus, as far as absolute rulers go, was actually fairly modest in his exercise of powers, and generally acted like the Speaker of the House and left the senators to their own affairs. Augustus played up his position as emperor as the preserver of the Republic and the guardian of peace.     The facade of Republicanism continued throughout the early empire, but it became the slow, concerted effort of the emperors to gradually sap the powers of the senate. By the reign of Marcus Aurelius, the senate was mostly inept and most of the power was concentrated solely in the emperor's hands. The beginning of the end occured with the ascension of Maximinus Thrax, born a commoner, who worked his way up the ranks of the military and was declared emperor by his men in 235 CE, and he assumed the imperial purple without the jurisdiction or approval of the senate, nor did he ever step foot in Rome once in his life. The facade of Republicanism died with Maximinus Thrax and the economic calamity of the third century, and the next Emperor to establish some stability in the Empire was Diocletian, who imported a Persian style monarchial system that completely disregarded the Senate.     Thus, Augustus's "surrendering" of his power was a political ploy to placate senators who still harbored Republican sentiments. Even though he still had de facto unlimited authority, he wisely limited himself as not to arouse the angst of a people who still cherished their liberty. Later Emperors would not be so modest.|`|m1oEGlnmaa	Absolute power corrupts absolutely.     :(|`|AA10729675	He played Republican, but he was a prince and prince he wanted to be. So the senators thought they had the power, but he was manipulating everything.  And the senators along with everything else.  He also played prude, puritan, the one who rejects vice.  He played the one who wanted to return to ancient Roman traditions very sober, and strict (a little like in Sparta).  Augustus had lived a very strange childhood and had seen Caesar, his uncle, manipulate crowds.  But Augustus was NOT Caesar.  He did not see that weakening the senate would bring about a lot of disasters for Rome once the emperor prince would not be as strong as him.  We can say the same of Caesar who did not see that putting an end to the republic was good with him, Caesar, but not good with an idiot cruel like Nero or Caligula.

lIRCcWpSaa	Pressure from Teddy Roosevelt to act  Wilsons desire to be involved in negotiations  German sabotage of both Black Tom in Jersey City, New Jersey, and the Kingsland Explosion in what is now Lyndhurst, New Jersey.   German use of submarine warfare and unsolicited attacks on shipping from all nations.  Zimmerman note.  Domestic propaganda campaign.    It's all on good old Wikipedia.....!    In regards to Lord Britain, I disagree that Germany was "broken", Russia had surrendered in 1917 which meant Germany had won on the Eastern Front, all those troops were quickly on their way to the Western Front and if anything the USA would be scared that Germany could actually win the war so intervened to stop German domination of Europe. Also with the Russian surrender and revolution it was a worry that revolution would quickly spread through Europe.....    Germany proposed that Mexico and Japan join the war in the famous "Zimmerman note". It promised Mexico Texas, New Mexico and Arizona in return for declaring war on the USA, should the USA join the war, and should join with Japan in order to defeat the USA. "Tuchman, Barbara Wertheim (1966), The Zimmerman Telegram (2nd ed.), New York: Macmillan, ISBN 0026203200, OCLC 233392415"    A few bits of "propaganda" for you to consider.....  http://faculty.umf.maine.edu/~walters/we...  http://suhistory.com/images/zimmerman%20...|`|olahi6esaa	None of the above. The real reason is that American spies in Europe reported to Woodrow Wilson that the British had broken the Germans, and were on the verge of winning the war.

IaFTUQQGaa	You should really read them for they are simply written and straightforward.      In Walden, Thoreau Affirmed that Every man is responsible for his own life and not to worry about how anyone else may perceive them.         It is never too late to give up our prejudices.   Henry David Thoreau' Walden    "If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away."   -Henry David Thoreau, Walden       And for On Civil Disobedience: he's a bit more long winded and I cannot quote accurately for that one.|`|iYoCZVpmaa	i don't now : D|`|B5Fm455paa	They don't.|`|3g3SCnDDaa	In regards to his work titled "Civil Disobedience", Thoreau is basically saying that government will always abuse its power. This applies to democracies as well. This is because that even if a majority of the population (majority rules) makes a decision for the rest of the country or state, it doesn't necessarily mean that majority is in the right, morally and consciously. Thoreau points out that when one suppresses their own opinions and individual philosophies for the sake of the government and its laws, then they are serving their government poorly, by serving as a slave to said government. A lot of this was based off of Thoreau's strong distaste of slavery in America, but it still applies today. Peace!
