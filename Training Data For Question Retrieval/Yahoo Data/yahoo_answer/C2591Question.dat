I am wondering what guys that work on these think of them and have any issues come up ? 32K so far--no problems-just oil changes.

20090227083811AA6ohAc	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My Mustang runs rough at acceleration.?	I had a vacuum hose to the fuel injection that had cracked.  I was not anywhere near a auto supply store to get another hose so I taped it up with electrical tape until I could replace it.  The car was running fine with it taped & then I found the car starting to run rough especially at acceleration from 0 to about 20 mph.  I have since replaced the hose (the original was a straight hose directly from Ford & the new one is a molded hose which should have been on).  I reset the computer and drove the car back to work.  The car is still running rough but I read in the manual that it may take up to 10 miles for the computer to re learn everything.  Well, it is still running rough & now my service engine soon light comes on blinking for about 30 seconds & then going to a steady light.  I also filled the tank with gas.  I was wondering if I could have possibly got a tank of bad gas.  This car does not ping.  I am going to also be getting the plugs changed soon.   Does anyone out there have any ideas.  Thank you.

The amount of times I hit 54 mph going up a hill in the middle lane of a motorway, just as I get to the brow of the hill the Artic on the left finds a little extra speed and leave me or others like myself struggling to complete my overtaking, thus leaving me side by side and holding up any cars that may want to overtake..      For the sake of laying off the gas the artic driver would sit there all day long causing frustration to all concerned..

20090227084907AAXk7L1	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	Why can't certain drivers...?	...use a turn signal before they change lanes or make a turn?  Is it really THAT hard? Are these people just lazy? that inconsiderate? I've been cut off SO many times because some jerk doesn't use their turn signal. It's to the point where I'm concerned that my horn and my brakes are going to wear out.       Seriously, turn signals come with the vehicle on purchase so it's not like it's an extra option that you have to buy or anything. If your turn signal is broken then stick your freakin' arm out the window to use hand signals already!  If you're worried about losing your arm then buy a fake mannequin arm from some store that's going out of business!       I feel very much like Clive Owen did in Shoot 'Em Up where that guy cuts him off and Owen then rams the guy into a parked car.  I yelled "Yeah!" in the theatre when I saw that.       I feel like I want to cart around a box of hammers. And the next idiot that changes lanes without using their turn signal, I want to rifle a hammer into their window with a note around it saying "USE YOUR TURN SIGNAL!"      And the last thing is that some of these people flip ME the bird, when I honk at them...like it's MY fault that they didn't signal.  It's simple, if you want to change lanes, use your turn signal and I'll slow down to let you in.  How hard is that?    Thanks for letting me rant.

I'll be where lots of cars are plus the highway (where people go a minimum of 80mph).  Help! haha

I stopped to see if it was staffed so I could pay but no luck.   Now, I have sent them a check for my toll, but they threaten to block my vehicle registration if I don't pay a ridiculous penalty.

20090307160206AAziAZY	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	I was rear-ended in Illinois.  How do I combat run-around by the other driver's insurance company?	On Feb 16 2009 I was driving my 2009 Acura.  I was rear-ended while stopped on 294 North by a 1997 Toyota.  The IL State Police officer's report supports this.  The other driver was issued a ticket for "failure to reduce speed" and "following too closely".  The other driver's insurance company claimed that their client said I "stopped suddenly and locked my brakes" and thus they will pay no more than 70%.  My car currently has an estimate for $10100 and work has not started yet.  No lawyer will touch it on contingency because it is property damage only and I am not claiming injuries.  How do I get this resolved quickly.  And no, going to my insurance is not an option.  I was driving a company car and they aren't very helpful because it is a fleet policy and there is no personal relationship.
20090307164025AA3FP2y	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Question about following distance in left lane on interstate?	When I'm in the right lane, I always leave a safe following distance because that's the lane I normally drive in when not passing (if there's only 2 lanes in each direction). But when I pass in the left lane, I always find myself behind someone with only 10 feet of space between my car and the car ahead of me going about 75-80 mph. It seems that every time I leave a space in front of my car, either a car from the right lane would move into my space or a car behind me in the left lane would see a small gap of space in the right lane to quickly pass me on the right and then move in front of me in the left lane. Don't you hate that? And I am passing cars in the right lane, but I can't control the speed of the car ahead of me. So, I find that leaving very little space in front of your car in the left lane would prevent someone from moving in front of you. And I find there's always a line of 10-15 cars in the left lane bumper to bumper going 75-80 mph waiting to pass. This is how "pileup" accidents are caused. And sometimes I am in that line of 10-15 cars. It seems that the first car is causing the problem by not speeding up to pass quicker.      But anyway, the way I see it, traffic coming to a stop in the left lane is slim. But one time traffic did slow down to 55 mph for unknown reasons  and traffic in the right lane started passing us back.      What do you think and what do you normally do? Do you think it's safe to drive bumper to bumper in the left lane going 75-80 mph? Probably not, but that's the only way to prevent someone from getting into your space. There's probably no real solution to this.

20090307171459AAv3Jkw	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Car only getting spark on two out of four Spark Plug Wires can someone help?	Hey everyone I have been posting a lot about my car lately and I solved my spark issue when I changed out the engine computer I have a Mitsubishi Eclipse 1996, 2.0 L, DOHC Non Turbo. Well when checking all the spark plug wires that ran to the ignition coil I found out only one of the 4 spark plug wires were actually getting spark from the ignition coil. So I went out and bought a new set of spark plug wires and once I tested these only 2 of the 4 spark plug wires were getting spark from the ignition coil. So now I went out and bought a new ignition coil pack and replaced that and it is still having the same issue. Could someone please let me know how to solve this problem with getting the other 2 to get spark?

Today I tried to crank it over for the first time and it did nothing. I noticed the fuel pump keeps running constantly with the key in on and run position. Next i got the starter wire and tried to tap it against the positive terminal and I didn't get any results. I even changed out the fuel pump and ecc relays. I also changed the starter relay solenoid on the fender. Please help me out with any ideas so I can get this truck running again. Thank you.
