So a few nights ago, my girlfriend and I are blazing some bowls, and when we got the munchies, we both agreed that it'd be dank to go get some sushi.      So we go to this new sushi place in town, and this totally catches me off guard, but they serve sushi off the torso's of naked girls. Now, i've seen this a couple times before, the women have flowers placed over their boobs, and she lies down on a table and you're just supposed to eat off of her.       But what threw me off was that this was in a public restaurant where anybody could come in. So im sitting here with my girlfriend, blazed out of my skull and just trying not to gawk at this beautiful asian girls boobs...awkward... My girlfriend was fine with the whole scene though, in fact she was even kinda checking the girl out.      So finally, here's my question, what is the reason behind serving sushi off of naked women? Is it like some kind of Japanese tradition? Is there some reason behind it, or is it just a gimmick to get people to eat more sushi?

20090307070150AAgabDT	Food & Drink;Entertaining	Wheel of Fortune Birthday Party Help?	My son is obsessed (understatement) with all things Wheel of Fortune.  He has asked to have a Wheel of Fortune party for his 4th birthday.  I can handle making the cake, but am drawing a blank for Wheel-themed party food and party game ideas!  As far as food, I was thinking of letter shaped mini sandwiches and letter cookies.  Any other ideas? Maybe a kid friendly recipe to incorporate pasta wheels?  Party games are an issue.  The other attendees are younger (20 months-3 1/2), so they would be unable to play a real game of Wheel of Fortune with my son. I want to play something similar to Wheel of Fortune, but easy enough for the younger party guests to participate somewhat.   Help!
