Mainly because elementary school is extremely easy. Now, I'm 13 years old, and I've been getting C+'s in history and math. It's not because I'm a slacker. (Yes, occasionally I do not pay attention and get a D, or C on a test.)   I'm just not the A student I used to be. My work is hard! It's too hard for me. I get help, and sure, I can usually get a good C+ or a B- on a test.   What's wrong with them? I know all parents want to see their children excel. Just now I got the mail with my report card, and my mom freaked out! It went a little like this:   "You're getting C+'s?!"   "Yes, mom. C is good."   "C is not good!"   "C is average."   "You aren't of average intelligence!"   "I am to me..."      And that's how it ended. She got all silent, and I went to my room, where I am now.   How can I convince my mom that I'm not the perfect kid? I always use a non-angry, calm, voice when I talk to her about this kind of stuff.      Please help.   Thanks!

I am a T.A. in College, I have a student, a girl who keeps disturbing my class by her weird remarks, I mean, whenever I assign a homework, she has to say that she doesn't understand anything. And she says it in class, well, I hold office hours during the week and the students are more than welcome to come and ask any question they may have about the homeworks or the course. This student waits for the last minute and then says in class that she doesn't understand anything about a particular question when the homework is due. I am not sure exactly what her problem is, but I have the feeling that she enjoys seeing me embarassed in front of other students . Anyways, I give her decent grades, she is a B-B+ student, so she really is not failing this class. Well, it came to the point when my whole day gets ruined by her remarks during class. I also have really good students who want to listen and work hard for this class. I am wondering, what should I do about her? Should I call her in my office and tell her to stop disturbing my lectures, or what should I do to have a normal atmosphere in my class with a student like that?

20090307075229AAQsg55	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Summer Drivers Ed vs. Summer Program?	I'm currently a junior in high school, and this summer I'd like to do drivers ed and maybe a summer program through Parsons Pre-College Academy, or at SVA, or even this cool photography camp National Geographic sponsors for High School students. The problem is, is that I can't do both. The scheduling of each would interfere with one another, plus it's just too much money invested at one time.      If I were to do driver's ed in the summer, I could have my junior license by the first day of school senior year. But our school is thinking of closing down campus (uncertain, but most likely due to construction), so if that's the case, then I could always just take it in the fall since it's not like I could drive to school and go out for lunch.      The summer program would give me a great idea for the field of study I want to go into for college, plus if I do it this summer, I'd have it by the time I start applying to colleges in the fall. I don't know what I should do!

20090227083451AAzEvLJ	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What can i do as an Indian 18 year old NRI?	My Parents always fought alot while i was growing up. It was really bad for a while. And since grade 8 i suddenly wanted to be better in academics and all round. I used to get alot of crap for not being brillant as ofcourse my parents had been. The trouble was when i was a kid all i wanted to do was get out of the house, and i didnt think much of studies because they were fighting all the time. We moved abroad when i was 6 and since then my mum has been depressed till todaay. She is so depressed she lies on a matress on the floor and has prozac evryday. She is that depressed. And my father drove her to this partly. He has some very cruel things and all behaved oddly in the past. I cant  go into evry detail but its safe to say its pretty much like breaking your head dealing with him sometimes. See my problem is   when i started alevels he didnt want me to do it, as it gave me full opportunity to apply anywhere abroad. He has this tactic where he will sit in my room and fight while i study, telling me "YOU ONLY CARE BOUT STUDYING, nothing bout this family". And things like that. I know his going through his own problems. And i feel like a punch bag for him for many years. I hve struggled alot in getting good grades but up to highschool ive done pretty well. Last year through brutal force he managed to take me out of alevels because i did badly for 2 papers due to horrors that started happening more and more at home, things like picking fights with me before my test in the morning and den apolgising the next day after i had no time to go thru anything the night before. Either way he justified it because i did badly for 2 papers, ive actually never got grades like in any final exam in my life. So i was shattered. My dreams of peace gone with it. I have been waiting to turn 18 for a very very long time. But as i am indian, parents only pay for you foreign degree if your doing engineering, or medicine. ANy business degree at bachelors abroad seems worthless in my dads eyes. I always  wanted to build up my cv outside but they wud never let me do anything outside school. SO i have tried my best at being in charge of clubs in school. Even thou my dad has treated my brother differntly-like paying for his outside school sports training. Which he never did for me, even though i begged. WHat im trying to say is ive been trying so hard to get myself a good chance at going abroad wid so much MASSIVE resistence from my parents especially my dad who didnt know much about what was going on in my education-just his problems. So he never let me do anything in the weekeds. I would just sit and listen to all his problems at 7 about how my mum made him lose his job.. And how life had been unfair to him.      SO i have been driven to my limit. I am not doing a course recognised worldwide anymore. I wish i was in india doing the indian board exams because atleast i wud far away from him and i could jus focus. I do believe in myself. I am smart. I can go far. But my dad is very controlling, he is very depressed, and has lost his friends and now my mum is locking herself up in her room and doesnt talk to him coz she hates him now. I do understand he is go thru alot of crap but he has never helped me thru anything. Neither had my mum. BOTH my parents have spent most of my 18 years thinking about their feelings and how miserable their life is and not doing anything bout it. While they make me sit thru hours and hours of self pity. It really has been sickening. But i have lived thru it due to my amazing friends. Now im 18 and ther negative attitude is affecting me. I DONT WANT TO BE LIKE THEM. BITTER AND MISERABLE. I have so much i want to do in this world. But i need a good start. Away from my parents so i can have consitency in my grades and not miss things because of my parents. I dont blame them for anything, i jus think ther in my way. They dont rlly support anything i do. They jus want me ther to listen to ther problems. ANd my dad doesnt want me to go anywhere rite now until masters. ANd he always told me i wud go for bachelors wen i was a kid. So i dont kno if i want to stay here. I want to shine. But i cant living with them. I will come back and help my bro. BUT first i have to helo myself before i turn into them. Its likes that saying, help yourself or else you cant help others. Just believe me for a second. Ignore that im 18. Ignore that you think im being dramatic because people dont like to believe that a childs own parent would sabotage them, because something like that is not easy to digest. Believe me i kno, ive dealth with keeping quiet about it. But no more. I want help. I want to know.. how do i get out of this? I just want to work hard to my full potential in a peaceful environment away from the crazyness of my house. Im doing a australian pre u that only australia recognizes but im doing it to probably go to monash malaysia. I cant stay with my parents longer than this. I really cant.. undergrad isnt like school.. and
20090307121830AAiJ4j7	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Were college admissions in the 1960s and 70s as competitive as they are now?	I am a junior in college, but I know a lot of people in high school worrying about where they are going. It was the same way when I was in high school. Has this always been the case or is it a recent phenomenon to have this much competition in colleges, internships, etc.? So I guess I'm asking those who have lived to see both eras haha.    Thanks

I just remember some professor i think, and he won't let the girl out of the place. then im not sure if its jason or who but this guy in a mask comes out and he looks like a teen and they show his story real quick, i guess he had a bad childhood. then he puts the mask back on apparently and kills the professor. the girl goes and ends up killing him presumably. the cops come and it shows that she though she killed the guy but it ended up being some girl. she then repeatedly says "he's still here!" and i guess they arrest her.then the movie ends.   its not scary movie or scream if that helps. anyways thanks.

But I'm super worried about high school. I applied for a program in a high school that's more difficult than other programs. It's the IB (International Bacceleraute...something like that. Lol) I'm really worried about it, though. I've heard about people passing out from stress and others crying the first day of school because of all the homework they have. Then I hear that a football player who has practice almost everyday is in the program and goes to bed at around 11, which he calls late. He only does about 2 hours of homework. When it's put like that, it doesn't sound bad.   But I'm going into an enormous school, coming from the tiniest school of life that spoon feeds us for everything. I'm worried I won't be able to handle everything.   On top of this, none of my friends are going into the same program as me. I'll have to make new friends and I'll probably have no one to sit with at lunch..      So, if you're in an IB program or something similar, how bad is it?    Can you still hang out with friends over the weekend?   Do you get the same lunch periods as other areas in the same grade?   Are there any other tips you can give me for my first year?   ...Will I get lost? Lol, I can't help but think I will. That school is HUGE.      Thanks everyone!

20090307154824AAcisZG	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Can someone please edit my essay for social work?	I am applying to the Master's in Social Work program because my goal is to improve the lives and enhance the well of individuals who are often discriminated, disadvantaged and poor. I want to help others maximize their potential and steer their lives in a positive direction. I am particularly concerned with helping change the lives of our most vulnerable individuals; especially our troubled and neglected youth. Therefore, I want to become a social worker to make a positive difference in their lives and empower these individuals to help them function more effectively with their problems.      I am a thirty four year old woman who struggled with and overcame homelessness. When I was homeless, having an advocate and an mentor helped me connect with employment services. But first I needed someone to meet me where I was and treat me with dignity.      I had a mentor that taught and guided me in my life. The impact that she had on my life inspired me to want to help others. I want to use the knowledge and understanding I have gained to assist people in changing their lives. I believe education is the key to being able to do that. Specifically, a Master's degree in Social Work would put me in the greatest position for achieving my goal. A social worker on Skid Row in Los Angeles started me on a path toward healing my own life. She provided me with constant support and a sense of hope. Six months later, I found a job as a youth counselor at H.V. Group Home, a residential treatment facility, working with incarcerated youth who were mostly minorities.      I am deeply concerned by the high incarceration rates in our society, specifically the way youth lead the way in going to jail, rather than being productive individuals in society. It is my sincere hope to contribute on how to best counsel and care for at risk youth. My research interest focuses on juvenilies, especially those at risk of spending their young adulthood behind bars.      In my job as a youth counselor, my primary work responsibility was to serve as a positive role model for adolescents aged twelve to eighteen. The residents encountered issues such as physical and sexual abuse and homelessness. Some of them had problems with drug and alcohol abuse, depression, and behavioral problems. At times my job could be extremely stressful. But I discovered that I had the ability to connect with the adolescents and develop strong emotional ties with them. I focused on several areas of treatment including their social skills, coping skills, and independent living skills. My main goal was to help them build their self-esteem and improve their sense of security.      The adolescents could become physically assaultive and self- harm themselves. It was during these critical situations that I would experience problems in knowing what the best clinical approach was to use when a child was self-harming. I would like to have better tools to help these kids when they are in crises and know whether the interventions work for them. I hope that with the aid of the Master's degree in Social Work, I can achieve that. I want to be able to help them in their time of crises and teach them the necessary skills the kids will need to transition into a more independent way of living. These youth need all the attention we can give them in order to prevent recidivism, especially African American and Hispanic males, who tend to continually come back into the system. If you were to grant me the privilege of studying in your program, I would like to research the recidivism rates of African American and Hispanic juveniles and young adults. I hope to contribute to our understanding of how we can improve the quality of lives of these individuals.      In my life, I have set my own guiding principles. Although I can talk about my biggest principles. Inspiration can come in a multitude of forms, but mine comes in the form of service. As a career, I want to be a social worker, helping the poor, the hurt, and those whose lives have dealt them a bad hand. I have always lived by the motto "do unto others as you would have done to you", and feel that the best way to do this is by furthering the ideal of social justice in the way I live and work. Social justice, as I see it, si the value system that recognizes the inherent worth and dignity of every human being and the right of everyone to be treated fairly and with respect. Every individuals is worthy of dignity and respect and have the ability to be self-sufficient to make the best possible choices for themselves. When we as a society truly endeavor to see the world through the eyes of the less fortunate, we can empathize with and understand one another. Only when each individual of a community is afforded the same level of dignity and respect can society truly be called civilized. Those who cannot demand social justice for themselves must have a voice to demand it for them. It is my hope that by earning a Master's degree in Social Work I can be that voice fo
