Also it gave me a heads up on all possible outcomes including the ones you don't want. It was a comfort to know what my doctor was doing without having to ask him a million questions and what pain medication was an option for me. Being kind of a control freak I like to know what exactly is going on otherwise I get anxious and stressed (even when my hubby is taking me somewhere and won't tell me where).

But at 38 weeks, that isn't to early for the baby to come if the baby needs too. So if they were to induce you, it'd be ok. =) Good Luck.|`|9NC2CHQkaa	my best friend just had her baby yesterday and she was over due by like 4 days and was going to be induced on the 11th.|`|9RcwQgNpaa	Hello, and congratulations!  I think, with a first baby especially, you simply can't tell what will happen.  <br>  When I was pregnant I asked every mum I knew what their experience had been, and tried to predict my own, but in the end it'll be a surprise (unless you're booked in for a c-section, but even then....  who can tell!)<br>  <br>  I went into premature labour at 32 weeks, but the doctors managed to stop the labour progressing and after a week in hospital everything was normal again.  Then at 36 weeks, my doctors decided to try and "turn" my baby, as she was breech, and I was going to attempt a natural birth.  When they do this, it can start labour, and I was kind of expecting that to be honest.  But no!  Some cramps and angry kicking (!), but all the same, plus the head stayed down.  Then by 38 weeks I'd had enough, I was huge (well, I'm very small, have a very big uterine fibroid and baby very large!) and my blood pressure was creeping up and up.  So I had a membrane sweep.  Nothing.  Had another sweep, still nothing, but I had a "show", so I thought labour would happen in my 39th or at the latest 40th week.  In the end, I was induced as I went into my 43rd (!!!!!) week, I had been hoping to get an induction earlier, or a scheduled c-section, but my doctors had other ideas.  So, I was induced, labour began and was fast and painful, really big contractions, but at about 7cm dilation my body decided to just stop.  Labour just... well, stopped.  By this time I'd got an epidural in (thank God!) and was very, very tired.  After 24 hours of labour my baby got "distressed" (and swallowed some meconium, poor girl!) and I was whisked off to theatre where I was given a caesarian and our baby girl was born, (8lb11!) within minutes.  She was fine, and so was I, but boy, what a wait!!!!<br>  <br>  Have to say, if I ever embark on another baby, (and 2 years on the annoyances and pain of pregnancy seems so distant!) I'd love another caesarian, but a planned one.<br>  <br>  Whatever happens to you and your bab'y, I wish you an easy, joyous experience, and happiness.  Best wishes.|`|DhUqibKDaa	I was due January 20th (apparently) and had my beautiful baby boy on January 13th. But when he was checked over the nurses and doctors said he was actually at 41 weeks! So you just never know!! Just relax, don't get worked up about when your baby is coming and just enjoy laying around and being pampered! <br>  <br>  BUT! I was told and found alot of research saying that your first baby is more likely to come later and a longer labor! A friend of mine went 9 days over her due date and was induced with her first. My labor was AMAZING! I personally believe its all in your head! Tell yourself you can and you will! Mothers are very strong individuals! <br>  <br>  Again, I technically went over my due date but I didn't know that!

AA12381247	Perhaps one of the hardest parts of getting pregnant as a teen is telling your parents (and you will have to tell them at some point). Speak with the father of your child to see if he is willing to be there with you when you tell your parents. Be willing to do the same for him when he tells his parents. If you think it will be easier, you might want to tell one parent first and then let them tell the other or be there with you when you break the news.<br>  <br>  You could also write your parents a letter. Tell them you really want and need their support right now. Obviously, you don't want your parents to freak out, but understand that they probably will. Give them a chance to absorb the news and then talk with them calmly. Explain what happened, whether you made the mistake of not using birth control or you used birth control but it didn't work. If you've made a choice about your pregnancy, tell them about your decision and explain how you came to that conclusion. Listen to any objections that they might have. They might raise a point that you hadn't thought of.<br>  <br>  If you have decided to become a parent, your parents will probably be very concerned since you are still a child yourself (at least to them). They do have a right to be concerned. It is well known that teen mothers are at a significant disadvantage in society compared with women who become mothers later in life.<br>  <br>  Babies born to teen mothers tend to have a lower birth weight, have a higher risk of suffering from abuse or neglect and tend to perform poorly in school. Only a small number of teen mothers are likely to complete high school and even fewer will go on to higher education. Teen mothers are also more likely to end up on welfare.<br>  <br>  But just because these statistics exist, doesn't mean you have to become part of it. There are teen mothers who have gone on to success, through hard work, determination, and a strong support system. And it's not only your parents who can offer you support. Other family members might be able to help you out along with some of your friends.<br>  <br>  Also, check out what your community has to offer. There may be special organizations or services designed to help out teen mothers. Check to see if any high schools near you offer daycare services that would allow you to go to school and have your baby nearby. You could also check to see if there are any schools that are specifically geared towards teen mothers.<br>  <br>  Being pregnant when you are a teenager can be very scary. Don't be afraid to ask for help whether it is from your parents, your friends, your partner, or from a community organization.

AA10923333	Scan dates are not an exact science and they admit they can be out a week either side. Both my pregnancies they estimated that I was due a week earlier than my dates indicated. At least for you the scan suggested later. My midwife was trying to induce me way before I was really due. I found that midwives (and probably Doctors) seem to place more value on the scan dates than on the date of my LMP which I knew 100% was correct.

The best time is at about 4 a.m. Maintain a chart. You will find that on one day the body temperature drops from 1/2 degree to one degree. This is the day that your eggs are being released. If you want to get pregnant this is the day that you must have sex. Tell your husband to ejaculate on his inward thrust so that the sperms will shoot deep inside.<br>  <br>  After having sex you must stay in bed for about 30 mins with your knees bent up with a pillow under your buttocks so that the sperms will not pour out - to enable them to travel up. <br>  <br>  Get your husband to save his sperms in the testacles for at least 3 days before sex to enable them to mature well to do their job.|`|20cce664089fd85db45e9e1a57658dc2aa	14 days after your cycle....   and when you've realized you have all the patiens in the world....|`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	During ovuluation...|`|ba99d845ed91ad2ad9e5b363209ac6acaa	23-26 is good to prepare yourself mentally and physically.

d57b912c42ffb742761042c717f77e7eaa	Yes u can  ovulate during your menstrual...It is actually 7 to 14 days before or after ur menstrual but the best time to conceive is when u are menstruating and u have to ovulate to get pregnant so<br>  I would say yes positively.... Tina|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Yes she can ovulate on her period yes she can get pregnant on her period the possiblity of it happening depensd on the woman.  As far as pregnancy test...she would have to wait at least a week...maybe more.  Her best bet would be to go to the doctor in about four to six weeks.|`|8ba6a1763e2363f6da5d202d62fc504aaa	Yes, she can ovulate and get pregnant during her period. If it's been less than 72 hours since you two had unprotected sex, get her the morning after pill aka Plan B. Plan B is NOT an abortion pill and will NOT harm a pregnancy that has already started. Plan B simply supresses ovulation and may stop implantation (pregnancy). It is available over the counter in Canada and I believe in some states in America as well. Ask your pharmacist or go to your local planned parenthood. <br>  <br>  If it has been more than 72 hours, she can take a pregnancy test after 14 days since sex, but it's more likely that she'll get accurate results if she waits if/until she misses a period. False negatives are common when taking a pregnancy test too early. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  This would also be a great time to bring up your conversation about the 'what ifs' again, if you haven't already. Try and prepare yourself for her decision. If she's pregnant she has three options keeping it, putting it up for adoption or abortion. If she's not pregnant or decides not to keep the pregnancy, use a condom each and everytime you have sex and ask her to get on 'the pill' or another form of hormonal contracpetive. Condoms are 97% effective at preventing pregnancy and 'the pill' is 99%, a combination of the two makes pregnancy very very unlikely even in the case of a broken condom.<br>  <br>  If you have sex with anyone else, wrap it up!|`|81cbd912bbd34b4c2233fc6aabc56cc2aa	Yes you can get pregnant during menstration although not as likely.  A woman can release an egg and be fertile during anytime of her cycle but it is different for each woman.  Unfortunately, you will have to wait a few weeks to know if she is pregnant for sure now because it won't show up on a test for a while.  Around the time for her next period, especially if she is late, she can test her urine then with an at home test and have her do it with her first morning urine to be the most accurate.|`|8c7bbb5f9c41ebfc973b0a42228a4c70aa	a woman most definitely can get pregnant when she is on her period. the best thing for you to do is wait until she stops her period give it bout 3 to 5 days after she stops then take a home pregnancy test. the hcg hormone will be present if she is pregnant. if you get an invalid result wait 3 more days then retest. if after testing a second time you are still not sure, try going to a free help clinic, they can diagnose her better than she can diagnose herself. hope i helped.|`|a6c0d8f3de317220e3263a347a3230ffaa	ANY time you have unprotected sex, you risk getting pregnant.|`|AA10923333	Yes, it is possible to ovulate during your period, but less likely. If your girlfriend is young her periods may be slightly irregular, and stress can cause a woman to miss her period altogether (been there, done that). Wait til her next period is due and take a test. Buy a box with two tests because even if it's negative she might start to panic a few days later and need reassurance (been there, too).<br>  Best wishes.

d1135c2356e56497879047216b387a99aa	No.If it is on the hand and just once,it's not spanking,just the parent calms down by hitting you.It's normal for people who have difficulties with their self-control.|`|AA10560773	Not by the definition of a spanking when I was raised as a child. I learned a spanking was your mom hitting you on the butt with her hand. It does the trick for the most part, but in today's day this will get you locked up as all the liberals want a time out or some stupid idea of punishment that has NO physical contact. Go figure.|`|1df0ad311fbe59f9d01e90f00f853835aa	no thats a slap on the hand|`|77691785155ac844fcded5bfc8765990aa	Its not a spanking, but its still an act of violence. If you hit a child for whatever reason, it just means you don't know how to control the situation your in.|`|7840ecf42727fffe2d9179dc17a77c6eaa	ya, that's called a slap on the hand. A spanking in our home, is just like the old days. Pants down, over the lap, and a good red bottom.|`|AA11634250	No it's not. Their are other ways to discipline a child without slapping. Take the crayon and pencils away. Use your imagination.|`|f0f49830d899d32e723fa4545fb903ebaa	Not really your lucky i would have done much worse than that if you had colored on my walls lol.|`|3f380741c3d27d35978304284b81348faa	i would say no cause it realy didn,t hurt i would say a slap|`|AA10239183	I do not think so....  but I also believe in spanking kids.|`|e3711e8841223cccd7524370500d5466aa	It depends how you mean it to be.  You can pop a child's hand to help them understand not to do something.  When a child is  young no matter how smart they are, they do not understand the complete concept of spanking/smacking/popping/etc.<br>  I DO NOT believe in spanking.  I will pop my sons behind or pop his hand BUT it is NOT to induce physical pain nor does it.  My son  just turned one year, last week, and I have implemented my discipline technique since he would walk.  And within only a  month he knows what "No" means.  Now I do not need to hardly ever pop his hand or behind.  He is still testing his boundaries, but if I do not give him a raise, as in shouting "NO" or running after him and I just say no in a calm and deeper voice he responds very well!  <br>  If this is for legal reasons- check with your city department to ask what constitutes as spanking.  I know in California they have more strict standards as what constitutes as spanking.  They teach in school from Pre-K that if your parents or ANYONE EVER lays a hand on you, that you need to dial 9-1-1.|`|e86e0479c72dd64c051afe70039defc8aa	No it is not spanking. Spanking is when some lights up your butt with their hand, belt, switch or hair brush & etc: Which she probably should have done and made you repaint the wall. But you did accomplish what you set out to do "Piss her off".<br>    If I would have done that when I was a child. My Mother would have done more than slap my hand. She probably would have slapped my hand or face and then tore my butt up and made me repaint the wall. There definitely would not have been anymore markers or crayons around.
24281513444449bb7f91cb6e5c237d38aa	No.  Pregnancy signs wouldn't happen until have implantation--a newly concieved baby isn't yet attached to his/her mother until then.  That having been said, your new baby may have implanted.  It would be a very VERY early implantation.  But if so, you will get a positive response from First Response Pregnancy Tests in 4 days (after implantation, your body starts making the HcG pregnancy hormone--it will double everyday and be detectable about four days later).  Good luck and God bless!|`|64cf42bc52ec850f15dc4a39f2b95979aa	You should wait until Feb. 7th to test or 6th. if on a 30 day cycle! Way too early. I think I conceived this month and last period was Dec. 31st, but still too early for me too! Best of luck!!!!!|`|umiNtL5zaa	I also think its too early for you to test . You don't want to test too early and get negative answer &be discouraged because of that wait I am in the same shoe and my period is on the 27th but I called my Dr. he said not to test untill after my period date . I know the wait is the worest thing but try good luck.|`|8abec49c1ea367f1fcc8f56913503a66aa	those r the signs of pregnancy...u can take test...all the best...|`|xXqSyYLtaa	it is possible.  especially with the sore breasts.  i would wait another week to test though.
3CVfUiiJaa	I have been in a situation like this sorta.  I bought the different brand, and used one scoop of it with 2 scoops of my normal brand for the first day, and then I did 2 scoops of new, and 1 scoop of normal...it lasted until I could get to the store.  So I didn't totally have to switch my son to a new brand.  You can try this.  My doctor said it is easier to gently introduce a new formula then just starting it with full bottles.|`|AA11210211	It should be fine for a few days,I had to do this once to because my WIC wasn't active yet and my daughter is just fine.Just relax hun it will be okay.|`|bS5cGrVgaa	It will be perfectly fine....baby may spit up a little more or have a little more gas but it's not going to hurt the little booger! How old is baybay? many moms try many different kinds of formula to find a right fit. They all have the nutrients that baby needs to be healthy, it just might be a little harder on the tummy.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I would slowly transition to the new formula, mix the two together half and half. If your baby is on the sensitive she may not take well to the normal kind of formula, but its better than nothing. If it doesn't make her sick I'd feed it to her over the weekend.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	i would buy the advance now and mix it half and half with the sensitive until you can get into town to buy what you need. if you do need to give the advanced by itself, maybe you can just water it down a bit more so its not as harsh.|`|CV9jrgPqaa	omg  Its ok!! your baby will be fine if you switch formula... do not  feel bad or guilty.. things happen.. with my first daughter she always spit up and throw up until i discovered i have to keep switching her formula every 2 weeks.. every thing will be fine|`|WmgOgA4vaa	I went through the same thing. It'll be fine to change her formula for just a few days. She may have a stomach ache tho, give her some gas medicine for that.

Ever?  No matter what?  If you really mean never, ever, I don't think that's normal.  I mean, I had a happy baby, but of course she cried occasionally...  but if you mean he doesn't cry very often, but he does cry sometimes, then he's probably just a sweating kinda guy.  Does his daddy sweat a lot, or do you?  If he never, ever cries, I'd have it checked out, regardless of the sweating... good luck~|`|ipLBFZ4Vaa	Most babies tend to sweat when they are in deep sleep mode so it is most likely no big deal. If his sweating is accompanied by any extended pauses in breathing you need to call his doctor immediately because it could be a sign of sleep apnea.

P0Fjh59Eaa	My daughter had this all over her nose and cheeks. It took a few months. i think she was about 3 or 4 months before they started to fade. i just left it alone.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	You don't need to do anything at all. The bumps will go away on their own, without treatment, in a few weeks, although it's possible for them to last a month or two.<br>  <br>  Doctors recommend that you not put any creams or ointments on the milia. And don't try to squeeze these pimple-like bumps to make them go away faster — that could cause scarring. Vigorous washing and scrubbing isn't a good idea either: It won't help and it could irritate your baby's sensitive skin.<br>  <br>  Try to be patient. Your child will soon have her baby-smooth complexion back.
ebM6CxRQaa	Baby blues... or postpartum depression... she needs to give her baby to someone to watch and seek help. There are medicines, consoling, etc... she can get help.

hh892gJfaa	Boy's.<br>  <br>  Any name with a -son IS a boy's name, whatever new parents are calling their little girls now. No girl should even be named a -son name.|`|5vtVsqx6aa	Just looking at each name at first, Emmerson seems like a boy name and Emersyn a girl's name.<br>  <br>  Either way, it sounds more masculine to me.<br>  <br>  According to: <a href="http://www.babyhold.com/list/American_Baby_Names/Emerson/details/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyhold.com/list/American_Ba...</a><br>  it's a boy's name meaning Brave.<br>  <br>  However I do know people who use it for girls. Maybe they call her Emmy or Emma for short?<br>  <br>  Me personally, I'd only use it for a boy.  If I wanted a girl to be named Emmy or Emma, I'd name her Emma or Emily.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|Vm8btc0Xaa	Hi, I really like the name Emerson, I know some guys called Emerson and also a highly successful Brazilian automobile racing driver. His name is Emerson Fittipaldi.<br>  It's origininaly an English name and means: Son of Emery.<br>  It's not a girls name. Definitely not!|`|gkXLT9Z9aa	i think Emerson looks like a boys name and Emersyn looks like a girl name. kinda like how Carson is a boys name but my basketball coach named her daughter Karsyn. i'm not too fond of Emerson but i don't hate it either.|`|56nOQvnWaa	Its a unisex name.<br>  <br>  But its most DEF a boys name!<br>  <br>  I'm writing a short story and the boys name is Emerson!<br>  I personally love that name!|`|SN7YHJTbaa	I think it suits girls more, but it started out as a masculine name and I guess it's unisex now.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	I would have thought it was a boys name not a girl's name|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	emerson would be good for a boy.  i would never name a girl that|`|96RRWgQ2aa	I believe it is unisex.<br>  Personally, I see it as a girl's name.|`|6EenztwDaa	i like it better for a boy <br>  and i like it cuz emerson, like sam emerson from the lost boys|`|JHGEpA6Caa	I think that Emerson is a boys name.<br>  I suppose that Emersyn could be deemed as female but I still think it's a boys name no matter what. <br>  <br>  I'm not a fan of the name either way.|`|FL67UPPHaa	You're right, it's a boy's name. Names ending in -son mean 'son of', and so are male names. Misspelling it doesn't make it any more feminine. Some people have started giving their daughters male names, it's just the latest trend and I hope it dies down soon. <br>  <br>  I love Emerson for a boy.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	It's a boys name hence the -son at the end of it.  I don't care for it at all.  It seems more like a last name then a first name.|`|YGlzeym5aa	I think its ok for a boy, but not for a girl.|`|ZX2so3twaa	i've never heard it as anything but a last name, so i don't know.<br>  it sounds more like a guy's name to me.

P0Fjh59Eaa	oh good lord NO! lol, i use one small bag for both children. course i didn't need a huge bag because i breast fed mine. <br>  <br>  when my youngest was just born i did have more things in the bag because of his age..extra clothes, pacifiers, burp clothes etc. what i did was i divided the bag up in the middle w/a large zip lock bag of wipes so i had a spot for my daughter's diapers, extra clothes, & snacks and a side for my son's diapers, diaper cream, burp cloths, extra clothes, etc.  and topped it off w/my wallet and cell phone, which i kept in a small zipper clutch bag. now w/my daughter in pull-ups and my youngest almost ready himself i just use a small diaper bag w/wipes and pull-ups, diapers a pocket for snacks and i use the two outside cup spots for their sippy cups.<br>  <br>  believe me you'll figure out what works for you. don't be surprised if you buy one bag, figure out what works and then realize you need a different bag, i went through 3. and after all that mess ended up using one of the free-bee bags that the hospital gave me! lol|`|vKEYa8aeaa	just get a really big diaper bag, that way you can fit both into one|`|rFtKFp03aa	I have 9 month old triplets...

I don't take anything in... if we ever needed anything, I would just go out to my car.. <br>  <br>  When we are gone for the day - say a family gathering I just keep refilling my diaper bag... <br>  <br>  Hope that helps..|`|1MEnCmwoaa	I have been thinking about this also!

8fde5dccb87a1282536ebcda082dbb59aa	Are you perhaps referring to a woman who is "frigid", that is, one who doesn't enjoy sex and is relatively unresponsive?<br>  <br>  This outdated term does not describe a medical condition.  It usually describes an inept male sexual partner, though sometimes it describes a woman who has severe psychological issues relating to sex, usually as a result of past abuse.  (Again, a more skilled and sensitive partner will be able to help her through this.)<br>  <br>  In either case, it has no effect whatsoever on fertility, and the term itself is sexist and outdated.|`|ZNQgd84faa	whaaaa?<br>  <br>  are we talkin' Popsicles??  or cryogenics??

You should be fine just follow what ever instructions you were given and make an appt with your regl dr on monday.|`|2e5660fefd6ff995a078903562b76320aa	It means that you are just starting to dilate. If she can get a fingertip in that's about 1/2 cm. That's all I was at a few days ago when I was checked. But I lost my mucus plug today so I'm hoping it's dilating more now. But I also don't think exams can put you into labor. But I have heard of them making people crampy for a while after.|`|8cjFSBW9aa	Back in the old days and still pertinant today, measuring how dilated you are by fingers was used to estimate when you should go into labor. When the doctor, nurse, or midwife could insert three fingers into the cervix, it meant that you are fully diated and ready to deliver. Three fingers measures approx. 10cm, fully dilated. And no, getting a routine cervical exam when you are pregnant is not going to induce premature labor.|`|VzvDMvJmaa	it made my sister dialate more and she went into labor 3 days later <br>  but my friend didnt dialte and didnt have a baby for 2 weeks later <br>  best of luck|`|tGVt4LFgaa	Congratulations, you are dialating!  (but then again you could walk around for weeks at 3-4 cm).  Scraping the membranes can make you go into labor sooner, so can pulling the mucous plug.  I've heard that sperm can "break your water" (now that you've dialated they can get up there).  I'm pretty sure any "action" in the cervix area CAN trigger labor.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|6e6ee0ff55420ddeb572e71f40e045b0aa	I am wondering the same thing as I just had the same exam done, thinking I was leaking.

They wouldn't do ne thing to cause early labor. Even though women with an irritated uterus can cause you to dilate. My doctor said a finger tip was 1CM dilated..

Q05rrSX4aa	I stopped the Nuva Ring after 2 years of being on it, and this is our 7th cycle ttc and hoping that it will happen soon!
oVxr5B3Eaa	Not at all, since abortion is a pregnancy related issue. <br>  <br>  I know a lot of people are against it, but I hate the fact that people get bashed like crazy just for asking the question. Sometimes they just don't know where else to turn and they're freaking out looking for real advice and all they get is "BABY KILLER!"... I wish people who were against it would just ignore the question completely. <br>  I think those people should be given the true advice they are looking for from the people who know the answer. If someone asks how much an abortion is, they often get 20 answers and only 1 or 2 of them have an actual price and the rest is just bashing. Feel free to state your opinion, but make sure you actuall give the answer, for example "it's usually between $x and $x but I think there are much better options like adoption and many families looking for a baby". <br>  <br>  You don't know these people's lives and their reasons for their decisions so it's not really people's place to tell them they're wrong. <br>  <br>  I notice this in other categories too. Religion is a big one. Not every on that section is Christian, many are of different faiths, or no faith, but it seems like every question not asking something like "what is your favorite thing about god" or somehow praising god is just filled with answers from people preaching that they are misled by the devil and need to convert to Christianity. <br>  Another is tattoos where 90% of answers are "your going to regret that when your 80", "that was a stupid decision", "you'll never be able to get a job other than a prostitute you stupid hooker"... <br>  <br>  <br>  Long story short, if you can't answer a question with an answer giving the information the asker is looking for, SKIP OVER IT. It's not always your place to voice your opinion. <br>  <br>  I'm sure it's horrible for people pregnant or who have miscarried or ttc but again, could be a completely reasonable situation and they can't judge someones like based on a few sentences.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	They could ask in the woman's health section with a lot less criticism, however they are still pregnant and that is why they post their questions in the pregnancy section.  It doesn't bother me that they post these questions here, what bothers me is people asking how they can perform an abortion on themselves when they are 5 months pregnant or other crazy things like that.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I have no problem with abortion questions in the pregnancy section since you have to be pregnant to have an abortion.  I do think yahoo should create a seperate section for abortion like they have a seperate section for adoption though.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	it does not bug me.<br>  <br>  the answers people give sometimes bug me because they can be rude to people with serious questions....<br>  <br>  other times its trolling or people just trying to make others upset<br>  <br>  but i believe abortion is directly related to pregnancy <br>  if you are pregnant you have three options<br>  1.) be responsible and take care of your child<br>  2.) be unselfish and give your baby to a loving family that wants a child<br>  3.) get an abortion <br>  <br>  i dont believe that abortion is a contraceptive but sometimes it may or may not be an option for someone|`|x5SJDvIraa	No, because i realize that this is a question site. And abortion does have to do with the pregnancy topic. <br>  <br>  Honestly those who get offended need to just not open the question or put in there two sense. Its that simple.|`|FUNhlpiqaa	Just because shi* is related to ones as* doesn't mean I want to think about it when I'm looking at a nice one....<br>  <br>  How about the Health section|`|Hs3HjbMbaa	ehhh I think it's okay... sure it pisses off most women, but for the ones who actually stop and think about what this person is asking rather than being mean and wondering what in the hell they are thinking, but it gives the women who do look at the abortion questions (who don't agree with them or they are pregnant themselves) it could give them a chance to try to help these girls with their advice and maybe try to help them see things from a different view, like I was terrified about being pregnant(still am!!!) but now I'm very grateful for my little man to be here in a week!!!! <br>  <br>  and you know instead of being like you horrible murderer, try to give better advice by suggesting adoption...<br>  <br>     I guess it just depends on the person and how the question is asked...|`|98WKYtfwaa	It did annoy me but now i just ignore them, they should ask them in the womens health section, simply because it's more doctors, nurses and non judgemental people in there, whereas in the pregnancy section they're more likely going to get judged because there are pregnant woman, people who are TTC or people who've lost their babies looking at questions like these, which is bound to upset them more than the people in the womens health section.|`|POGZZmoUaa	Sadly enough, abortion is a way of termination a pregnancy. If you are not pregnant then abortion is not an issue. It make sense that abortion questions would be in the pregnancy section.  Maybe one baby can be saved by just answering the question with an alternate solution.|`|x0bJmyDPaa	No it doesn't bug me - it's a pregnancy-related question so of course it should be in the pregnancy section.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	Where else should it go - abortion is directly related to pregnancy|`|H0fXySX9aa	nope because its to do with pregnancy and also dont open them if you dont like it|`|2l7lbcJWaa	YES. They should go to the "women's health" section.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	yeah yahoo needs to make a section just for abortion
4IYwVGMMaa	Your probably not going to get Health Ins. now.  Since she is already pregnant it is a pre-exsisting condition.  You will have to try and get Medicaid to take care of her now.  Go to or call your local Department of Health Services and get all the necessary paperwork to fill out.  Good Luck...|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	You cannot get it, unless your income is low enough to qualify for state health assistance, known as Medicaid.<br>  <br>  In the U.S., insurance companies do not pay for preexisting conditions for the first 12 to 18 months of coverage, the time frame varies from company to company. Any medical condition you may have prior to getting the insurance, be it asthma, cancer, pregnancy, or anything, is not covered until the preexisting condition time period is over.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news!|`|nuFWsGIvaa	search on yahoo|`|AA11231784	Well hmm since she's already pregnant any insurance may not cover it since it's a pre-exsisting condition, but like the previous replier said call your local health department and they can point you in the right direction for getting health insurance to cover your wife while she is pregnant and maybe even you too.....Good luck and congradulations
06nXsYu6aa	well, you should do a test but also, the minute you start stressing about being pregnant your body reacts in a way you may not feel.. and you won't get your period because your body is stressed... guareented that when you do a test and its negative you will get your period nearly straight away!|`|xw0k1wwGaa	There is a good chance that you could be pregnant. It sounds like you are very tuned in with your body which is great. Personally, I didn't feel pregnant at all when I discovered when I was pregnant. In fact, I felt as if my period was about to start. I got the cramps and everything else that is associated with PMS. My advice would be to take a home pregnancy test and hope for the best! <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope everything works out for you!

kprKXEOSaa	I'm not a doctor.  What I'll tell you is what I know from my own research, and my own experiences.<br>  The body makes hormones from the building blocks we provide to it--meaning, the food we consume.  And we all know that most American's diets aren't that great, sadly lacking in fresh fruits and vegetables, too high in fat, refined sugar, fatty protein and processed foods.  So, if you're not giving your body the building blocks it needs to make hormones, it just can't do it.<br>  I had messed up cycles, and wasn't ovulating, and then when I did start ovulating, my luteal phase was too short, so even if there was a fertilized egg, it didn't have time to implant before my period started.  Reproductive problems, including menstrual problems and problems conceiving or carrying a pregnancy, do usually indicate a hormone problem--unless of course you have some physical problem, for instance an incompetent cervix or something from illness, injury or previous STD's that is causing the problem.  <br>  I believe that there are two things that a woman can do to naturally improve her fertility.  The first and most important is improved diet.  I highly recommend this book, "Lean & Free 2000 Plus" by Dana Thornock.  You can find it, used, on amazon.com for under $5.  With my first two children, I went through fertility treatments to conceive.  After the birth of my second, I was following her dietary recommendations and got pregnant the old fashioned way--surprise!<br>  The second thing, is using a wild yam cream.  Artificial progesterone and even the pill is made from chemically altered wild yam extract.  The cream absorbs through your skin and gives your body the building blocks it needs to create hormones.  When I first started using it, I would put it on 5 or 6 times a day.  As my cycles became regulated, I used it 3 or 4 times a day.  You can put it on your abdomen, thighs, chest, buttocks, the underparts of your arms, and your face.  At first, I would use it every day, then later, again when my cycles regulated, I would stop using it during my period.  When I did conceive, I continued using it throughout my pregnancies.  It's also a great moisturizer for stretch marks!  The company I bought from is called Syringa, you can find them online, and there are many other brands available.  Just make sure you get a good quality cream, if you decide to try it.  A cream is better than taking the extract in pill form, because much of the extract is destroyed in the stomach, so with the cream you bypass the digestive system.<br>  Both of these things I mention, are giving your body the building blocks it needs, naturally, in order to make hormones.  Again, I'm not a doctor, but I would highly recommend looking into improved diet and the wild yam cream, to improve your fertility.<br>  Hope this helps!  And good luck!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I don't know if there are correlations for women between pregnancies to have low progesterone.  I have had 1 pregnancy where the progesterone was low and took suppositories, which didn't work so we went to daily shots.  This did work the pregnancy progressed and the progesterone supplementation stopped at week 11 which is when the placenta takes over the progesterone supply from the ovaries.  It is common for women who have pcos to have progesterone issues.  Everyone I have ever met that had a progesterone issue, it was fixed by supplementation.  If this is the only issue, you have nothing to worry about.  Many pregnancies are diagnosed as threatened and most pull through.<br>  <br>  The hcg level is low but what is most important in the health of a pregnancy is not so much the hcg level but that your numbers double every 48-72 hours.  In 24 hours your numbers increased 50 percent, that would likely double in 48 so that is not a concern.|`|2f6diQBiaa	Actually, low progesterone is thought to be one of the main causes of miscarriages. Some women (like myself) do have chronically low progesterone. We don't notice it until we are trying to conceive and can't. It's great the the doctor caught it early and that you are on progesterone suppositories. It's not a guarantee, but the progesterone should help you during this pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!!!|`|OvpkQfG1aa	I had an early miscarriage on 2-12-09 and immediately went to the doctor DURING the miscarriage for testing. My progesterone level was also 5, but my hcg level had gone down to 8. The fact that your doctor has put you on progesterone sup's is a good thing, but the hcg level isn't looking great. But it doesn't mean that it's going to end for sure in miscarriage. <br>  Here is a chart to see what normal hcg levels should be at each week of pregnancy: <br>  <a href="http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/pfirsttri/0,,midwife_3pt5,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/...</a><br>  <br>  I'm not 100% sure about low progesterone being chronic. I'm going in for a progesterone level check 7 days post ovulation this cycle and will definately ask my doctor about that. <br>  Good Luck with your pregnancy.
rGci1ehoaa	they can put you into collections AFTER  the baby is actually born. they cant not deliver your baby... you will get a bill after the baby is born .. call the number. you will speak with someone who actually does the billing and im sure they will work out a payment arrangement with you. they would rather you make payments then not pay at all!! plus it costs them money to place you in collections...they cannot place you into collections until after you have received the services they are billing you for and you then default on payment, but like i said im sure they will take payments. where do you live?|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	Try applying for medicade you never know if you qualify, also question what the billing department is talking about most insurance companies cover pregnancy and labor fully.  If you do have to pay for something contact the doctors/hospitals "ability to pay" department and they will help lower the cost or arrange payments. The worse thing that can happen is it goes to collections and if that happens just make agreements to make payments with someone else.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	i feel sure he can because a hospital or a lawyer or whatever can so i guess a dr could report you too if he wanted to. i dont understand what the fee is though that insurance wont even cover. i have blue cross and our total amount we had to pay when we had our baby was 100.00 and that was it. ins. paid the rest.|`|n3IoftMFaa	This is why the US needs universal health care!<br>  <br>  You'll pay LESS in taxes than all these health care bills that you have!

Republican fool.|`|2IATHTXwaa	Try getting better insurance, make your lazy husband work a second job|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	I've never heard of a fee like that. I had private insurance when I had my baby and all I had to pay was the deductible by the due date. I could pay more if I wanted or I could be billed for the rest after the birth. They can turn you into collection but if you are paying something each month and making an effort I don't think they can. Just tell her that an 850 payment is unreasonable and see if you can make a different payment amount. I don't think this is right. Raise a stink and see what happens.|`|cO9sxO9raa	They HAVE to have some sort of payment plan they can't just expect you to come up with that much money in such a short period of time. I know most hospitals have a financial office that you can contact or write letters to and explain your situation so their either put you on a long term payment payment so it is easier to pay off or they could possibly take off some of the charge if they feel like you are not able to pay. Look into it, depending on which hospital you are at this could be an option for you. Hope this helps.|`|hpR1BOYjaa	If you have no written notice, I would go talk to a lawyer and see what they say.  <br>  <br>  Yes, you have the option to switch doctors at ANY time.  You have have 2 months left - that is plenty of time to move your records to another doctor.  I would do that immediately if you cannot afford to consult a lawyer.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are going to have a child I would highly recommend having an emergency fund of $1000 in case something were to happen.

EgZz6EK9aa	maybe he needs another oz.  my son at 2 months had a bottle every 3-4 hrs and the bottle was 6 oz.  at 2 months he weighed 13.6pds  i wouldn't worry how big your baby is right now.  he'll even out as time goes by|`|WlrWIXENaa	My baby girl is exactly 2 months old. She is drinking 4 oz. every 3-4 hours, sometimes even up to 5 hours. maybe he has a lot of gas if he's fussing so much or maybe it could be that he gets too stuffed.  Try giving him the pacifier, see if that works.|`|f4f8737596ea7251103ec066d1f68df3aa	Maybe he's fussing because he is eating too much. 5 oz seems like an awful lot for a 2 month old. I always fed mine 2-3 oz every 2-3 hours until they were about 4 months old and started eating cereal...|`|iQcsGFsQaa	about 4 ozs. every 2-3 hours seems normal. a 2 month old can't hold much more than 4 ozs. at a time i think.|`|3e84fefafa86e84da4c15fdc0df80738aa	I fed every 2 hours until she was approx. 4 months (breast milk is digested quicker)  After 4 months, I started bottle feeding and it spread to about every 3 hours.  She is on solids now 3 times a day with a bottle in between (not with the meals)  Some babies want to snack often and won't eat large meals.  Babies that young won't overeat.  Try a pacifier and see if its just the sucking that the baby wants.

ZlzsuDp3aa	Haha. I remember when we used to want to do that. Convince your parents that you will keep up with school work and stay on top of everything that comes first, and its technically "more important". Another thing my parents used to not want, was having the responsibility every weekend to have to pay for ordering food, having to stay up late cause we were, etc. If you advise them that they will not be the hosts every week, and that it will switch on and off between households. Also, parents are big on compromises. If you bargain with them and maybe say if I have a sleepover Friday, Ill be home all day Sunday and at night on Saturday. It might work better for you.|`|PTWnWkPRaa	change houses. say you are going to study. be responsible with your chores so it shows your parents you are responsible. if there is a time you cant have a sleepover, don't make a fuss, and realize things come up.|`|OGDkzvgdaa	Be sure to catch them in a good mood, and when you don't have that much time to talk about it so it's not akward, like when you're about to get out of a car.

On friday (if you have no one over.)  Can _____ come over tonight?" <br>  <br>  Now a all out sleepover like a slumber party every weekend is a bit much! But one friend isnt bad! Maybe a slumber party a week?<br>  <br>  I'm 23, with two kids and tonight im going to my first slumber party with other girls that ive been to since i was ... I dont know before my children were here! <br>  <br>  (Although this particular sleepover is a yearly thing...)<br>  <br>  Anyways! <br>  <br>  Hope i helped
YsnY9LqIaa	My daughter is very much like yours.  She's 17 months and clingy in the way that she doesn't want other people to hold her, or help her in any way, but - like your daughter - independent in that she wants to brush her teeth herself, shampoo her hair herself, brush her own hair etc and gets very cranky if you try and help her/do it for her.  She slept in our room (well, our bed) til 3 months ago where she's been mostly in her own bed, and it's made no difference - she still wants my attention 24/7.  If her daddy is in the room and watching tv/reading/on the computer, she doesn't care.  If I was doing any of those things, she'd pull the book away, try and shut the lap top, pull me down to the floor to play etc.  She just wants me there 24/7!  I don't think a nursery would help either, it will just make her more persistent in wanting to spend the time she does have with you with your full attention on her, and I especially don't like the sound of it if it makes her that distressed (as well it would my daughter.)  Like yours, even at playgroups and things, my daughter will go and find something she wants to play with and rather than playing with it with other children, she will bring it straight to me to play with.  It's not that she doesn't like other children or people - she does, but she just always wants my full attention.  The only thing I have found to partially work is to give her something specific to do (colouring, play doh, blocks etc) and say 'you play with this whilst I do ..... and then Mummy will come and play' and she's got up to a good 15 mins at a time of playing alone I'd say (at home only, still working on at playgroups!).  I know it doesn't sound like much, but it's a start!|`|irP2yTMWaa	Why do you have the bed in your room?? If your the only one there then your the only one to play with.|`|145RUNQHaa	I think you need to give her a little more time she's only two.she will eventually gain independence just be patient.the time you are spending with her now and the love and commitment you show her will do wonders for her confidence she'll spread her wings eventually make the most of this time when she wants only you you'll miss it someday.just keep doing what you are doing.you're doing a fantastic job.x|`|wxImZRssaa	My daughter turns 2 tomorrow, she won't play alone either. She does play with other kids, although only if I'm not there. If I'm there she clings to me. <br>  <br>  Is there any way you can let her play with other kids without you being there? Could a friend or family member take her to playgroup. <br>  <br>  My sister has 5 kids ageing from 1 and a half to 9. If I go visit my sister with my daughter she clings to me. If my sister looks after my daughter whilst I'm not there, she plays happily with her cousins.<br>  <br>  When I'm with her and there are other kids around I think she gets jealous. She wants to make sure I only pay attention to her. Maybe your daughters the same.|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	I find that letting them watch dvd's and kids tv helps, stuff like barney and the wiggles, shows that get them dancing and singing, let her watch and she will copy them, and give you a chance to get a cuppa! xxx also, take her to a local mother and toddler group so she can socialise while you are there to watch xxx|`|8U57JQKyaa	I have a 2 and a half year old son. He is the same way. He will only play if I or some other adult is playing with him.|`|AA11212578	You probably already know the answer to how to make your daughter more independent but here is my advice:<br>  <br>  1) make her sleep in her own room.    This will suck for a week or so but she will eventually come around.<br>  <br>  2) Tell her that mommy needs some alone time and she needs to play by herself for xx amount of time (30 min, 1hr, etc).   If she complains about being bored,  let her be bored (this is advice my wife got from a PhD in child development).  She will eventually find things to entertain herself.    Use a timer if needed so when she comes back to you every 2 minutes you can tell her that the timer isn't done yet. During playgroups, you tell her to play either by herself or with other children.   This will encourage her to reach out to other kids during playgroup.<br>  <br>  good luck.....|`|kziIf0r6aa	Maybe you should consider putting her into daycare where she would have no other choice but eventually play with the other kids.  Gives you a chance to get out and do the things you probably dont get the chance to do anymore like your hair nails or even a good massage.  She needs to learn that mummy and daddy are her parents you may need to think about moving her bed back into her room and start putting some of her toys outside where they belong like the sandpit.  She needs to be encouraged more so than told how things should be.  I think the trouble is she doesnt know any other way and you've created a habbit for her which may in time be very hard to break.  Speak with your health care nurses and see what they suggest, but the first thing would be to put her in her own room.  Just remember its not cruel to put her into care, she wont be upset for the whole day, my little boy only cries for the first 5 minutes then he's fantastic all day bounces out the door come home time.  Its best for them to interact and learn along with other children their own age.  Start maybe having some friends over at your place for morning tea giving your children a chance to play together while the mums sit and have coffee and catch up|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	your making a rod for your own back, shes not really a baby anymore and its time to sort her out. you really need to think about getting her into her own room, it will be hard but well worth it. as for nursery none of us like knowing our children are upset, but we do it for them because we want them to learn social skills and make friends ,which helps when the child goes to school because familar faces make things so much easier on a child. another thing is that if you had another baby , you would have to sort her out then and that could create jealousy.all my children at that age followed me around the house and i would talk to them while they played, you need to start being firm and say no if she pulls your clothes you put her on the naughty chair or where ever you choose. dont worry i believe most of us are soft on our first child then we toughen up lol. best of luck|`|Iqco1PcQaa	she needs interaction with people not a pile of stuff she doesn't know what to do with, she can't read, get her into a nursery so she can learn how to interact with other children, she will then be able to develop her skills, then be able to play with her toys and build her confidence. don't use the TV as a baby minder,sit with her and talk with her, you will learn more about her too

690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	I'll be 22 March 3rd so I am around your age.  I gave birth last year in July and she is a beautiful darling girl.  With that said, I would have waited a few more years.  I didn't realize how much freedom and independence I had until it was taken away from me.  I am not a selfish person.  I love my little girl with all my heart, I knew I wanted to be a mommy when I grew up and I still believe that I made the right decision.  However, be prepared to have to no time for anything.  You can't get up and go on a whim anymore.  You can't watch a movie all the way through without stopping. (What I would give to be able to do that just once!) LOL.  I love being a mom but sometimes I just want to pull out my hair and say I'm done...bye bye.  But that's not possible.  I wouldn't do it even if I had a chance.  I am a stay at home mother and I love it.  I spend every waking and sleeping moment with her.  I know every sound, every breath, every look, every touch.  I can tell just by looking at her or by hearing her what's going on.  She even makes a happy noise when she smiles.  It's so darn cute!|`|abT0o6hHaa	If you don't even have enough money to get your own place, then you ABSOLUTELY don't have enough money to raise a baby. My hubby  makes $50,000 a year we are still on a tight budget with our daughter. kids are expensive, life is expensive. Do what you want but you are making a mistake|`|tOdjjeAmaa	I had my first baby when I was 18, and now I'm 20 and pregnant with number two. I'm married this time lol.. my husband is both of my babies' father. Anyway, it's not impossible. If you plan on still working when your baby is born, childcare will take A LOT of money. It's expensive to raise kids, but remember this: you will NEVER have enough money to raise a kid. Seriously, it's all so subjective. <br>  I love parenthood. We actually intended to have the baby that I'm pregnant with haha. I wouldn't trade it for anything!! There is absolutely no love like the love you feel for a child, and it's the most amazing thing in the world. <br>  Worst things about parenthood: lack of freedom!! But with parents/family helping to watch the kid while you have a date night every once in a while makes it a lot easier. I moved away from my family because my husband is in the Army. It's hard to find money for a babysitter sometimes. Going out and having fun is not a common activity for us anymore!! <br>  Overall, I love it and would not change my life for anything. :) Good luck with your decision!|`|8oAlBL91aa	I would not ever take it back never ever ever ever......<br>  <br>  I was 15 when I had my first I'm 22 now and thats still young. But I worked my hardest and never heard anyone tell me I was doing wrong actually what I heard was I can't believe that a 15 year old raised my son so well.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	If you are good at saving money and good with keeping a budget you can make it work. People have made it work on far less. <br>  <br>  Only thing is you still live with your parents.... Get a place first see how that goes and see how your finance are then you can know for sure if you can afford it. <br>  <br>  Best thing is watching them grow and it happens so much faster then you ever thought. Also seeing everything for the first time throw your child's eyes is amazing. <br>  <br>  Worst thing lack of sleep. It is never just about you and what you want. Worrying a lot. Last night my little girl bumped her head on mine and was crying to hard like never before she is only 3 months.  When I looked at her crying like that I started to cry and freak out.  Thinking OMG something is really wrong with her. Well she was fine with in a few minutes. But I got scared and worried. <br>  <br>  I do love it my life before her was in a way meaningless I worked I played but now my life is so much more then that.  It's hard to explain. <br>  <br>  No harm in waiting a bit longer to have kids.|`|nti4j9k2aa	Honestly, I don't think your age has anything to do with it. However, the fact that you are still living with your parents tells me you are not in a position to have a child. Since you are considering going to college, it would be much much easier to wait until you graduate for many reasons. college and motherhood are both stressful and demanding. Doing both together will be alot of stress on you and your husband. At least get a couple of years of college under your belt. You will be able to provide much better for your child with a college degree. good Luck!|`|KCEUS7SZaa	First off if YOUR SURE YOUR READY you meaning you and him. then you might as well not plan for it. When the child comes you will prepare and do what you need to do to function and take care of things. Besides there are many places that help. WIC woman infant and children they will help in keeping the child healthy, providing formula etc. There are many places for help in your area and you will learn about them should you need them. 10.00 an hour fulltime with benefits your not going to be hurting to bad. Insurance will soak up most of the costs of the pregnancy so its not going to be a big financial impact. if i could take it back would i ----NO I LOVE MY KIDS i enjoy everything they have to offer, i enjoy watching them tranform into little adults. My first pregnancy was super easy everything was peachy and wonderful my second pregnancy was very difficult i had alot of issues and the drs were horrible and i had to have a c section but you know what just to see that little face when all is done i would do it again in a heartbeat!!!!!!! Well you cannot always rely on family they have hard times too and even though this sounds bad they wont be there forever. I would suggest you and your man getting a place of your own and getting set financially get your school finished and then worry about kids because when your pregnant most woman want to sleep alot because of the ups and downs of the body changing many woman get morning sickness and your not going to want to go thru that and go to school too. Second make sure your ready to be tied down look at your lifestyle and make sure hes ready to it means no more midnight parties and staying out all weekend. You have to be responsible enough to settle down and stay home and visit friends here and there but use common since in what you do so that your child doesnt suffer. No fighting in the household, look at your life and really think of what your going to have to alter and if your really ready to alter. you said your in your 20s ....your really lucky many girls are getting pregnant in there teens. I had my son at 28 which i must say i was scared to death but after he came i never knew i could love someone so much and i had never met him before. it was love at first site and now almost 8 years later i had my daughter and again instant love its a love no man can give you its a love you probably wont even think of when you look at your family. Its a love so deep that when the child comes into your life your willing to do whatever it takes to make sure they are taken care of and happy by whatever means possible. Good Luck i wish you the best.|`|SvS9T3Dkaa	hi being a parent is the best thing that ever happened to me. i was 18 and got married, and was almost 19 when i had my daughter, 20 and 22 when i had my boys. i am now 24. i can't immagine my life without them. it is not easy though, but experience comes with the days. i am sure it will be easier for you guys, because you have family around you. we don't have any family / or friends to help out. but i am sure, when you have your baby, you definately find it well worth. good luck on whatever you decide.|`|h6piTn8Laa	I am 18 , my husband and i live with my parents, he works i study . there are more positive aspects than negative about having a baby .The worst thing is that you have to think twice about what you normally would do, such as going out to eat, or the movies, things like that , there is  also the fact that most likely spending those special alone times with your husband wont happen without interruption,When your baby is born motherhood immediately kicks in. you will love him since the very first time you see him. I couldn't stop starring at my baby girl , its unbelievable . as a first time mother you just want to make sure hes ok and happy , you live to make your little bundle happy ! Honestly i think that if your ready god will give you that gift at His time|`|zERIAYmQaa	Your age is not a problem. We were 19 and 23 when we had our daughter and she turned out great. The only thing I would suggest is getting an education before having a baby because that job you have  might not still be there after you have the baby and if you are not skilled and qualified it will be hard to get a new one. And that income is VERY LOW when you are talking about baby and hoe expenses.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I have never heard anything negative about them, only good things-including from my pediatrician.  I do not know why anyone would tell you not to give them.  Why not ask them, so you know their reasoning and can research it? <br>  <br>  I highly recommend them, though.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	As far as I am aware, they are perfectly safe for babies when teething.(Unless they've been recalled which I don't think so)  I don't use them, but I use Camilia and it really helps my son when he is in lots of pain. <br>  <br>  I think people are just sticking their nose in your business.  Don't listen to anyone but your own instinct, and your doctor.  People will try to tell you what to do now, for the rest of your life...because they think they know best.  And while they might know things, only you will know what is best for your baby.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	They were recalled but they are okay now. I will give them to my baby when she starts teething. I used them with my son and that is the only thing that would help him.|`|49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	These are awesome and I highly recomend them.  I found them with my second daughter and used them with my son as well. I wish that I found them with my first daughter because they worked so well.  They eased the pain from teething, had a natural calming effect, and actually helped the baby sleep too.  Check out the website that is sure to answer any questions you might have:<br>  <a href="http://www.hylands.com/products/teething.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.hylands.com/products/teething...</a><br>  <br>  The website says:<br>  Sometimes it seems as if teething goes on forever, and it can be grim for both mother and baby. Hyland's Teething Tablets have made it easier for mother and baby for years. This homeopathic combination of natural substances relieves the restlessness, peevish whining and irritability.

They do work very well and I highly recomend them.  They worked much better than teething gels.  Have you ever used a teething gel? I hate that numb feeling, and these tablets don't do that....|`|zPYyGw8oaa	They were recalled a few months ago for containing metal...they should be safe by now. Another reason is possibly that they contain some sugar.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	I dont know why but there excellent and i swear by them there all natural and work great and i work in a pharmacy so i have an idea whats good an not!
zPYyGw8oaa	only if you poke it hard or in the soft spot...lol|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	LOL it depends on where you poke and and what you use most of the time babies love it when you poke their cheeks and feet, they laugh and it's cute, but don't poke the baby in an inappropriate spot or it's soft spot please.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	lol why would you poke it? it isnt bad but it will startle them and doing it to often will disrupt them which there is no need for|`|MAh2yKFnaa	while in the womb? no I don't think so but if it is born now...you really shouldn't poke the baby|`|jwboSl1Qaa	Is it bad if somebody pokes you?|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	why would you poke it for god's sake?...|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	Poke it?

Bring them both presents, like stuffed animals, or a board game, and wrap it up, they like to open presents. For the girl, you should bring a variety of makeup, nothing like blush and eyeshadow, but lip gloss and nail polish.|`|bGRexKPyaa	since you say the little girl is a girly girl bring nail polish to do her nails and other things that may interest her. Even dora the explorer movies or something a little girl will enjoy...<br>  <br>  Or just lock them both in a room. LOL just kidding|`|bfx2ypVKaa	lol good luck|`|Ht0GTOOyaa	Turn to their favorite cartoon and sing along with them theyll love it you dont have to be perfect at singing but books sometimes for kids like that at a young age are kinda boring so either play a rhyming game like rapping or simon says or just goof around just think about what you liked as a kid and theyll love ya. tire them out and play tag just to get them to fall asleep or tickle them play barbies with the little girl or bratz doll.email me for questions name is janaew.|`|Zjb4p1TRaa	Honey, she's never met you before, she's most likely shy.<br>  It takes time for a child to trust you and to feel safe.<br>  It's great you bonded with her brother but just be calm. <br>  She likes princesses?  Use your imagination based on their likes and dislikes.<br>  But considering you don't know them all that well, why not leave it for this week and promise her you'll bring her ______ next week, find out what she likes and good luck!|`|1TRJPGVgaa	If the boys just like your brother do what you always do. For the girl try bringing some of your old barbie and some princess dress up clothes. I babysit a 6 and 7 year old and they always like it when I bring a book, toy and game from my own house. Try to make up a game that both children can play but if she refuses to do anything with you just give her time she may be nervous or just has to grow on to you.|`|vk3CsYJ9aa	I have had one of those that liked to ignore and act like a princess too, I have just as the other girl brought nail polish and lip gloss. If you start painting your toes she is going to get interested and want to have her toes done to, you can tell her that you can play beauty shop and you can play with each others hair and stuff like that. by the end of the night you two will be best friends. Make sure to read her a bedtime story, let her pick it out if she has books, and a good movie helps to settle them down before bed. Don't worry about things, as long as you check on them once an hour after they go to bed you will do fine.

SRsFkNBBaa	i agree. when a child repeatedly gets into trouble, it is the fault of whoever is raising them, becuase they werent consistant. every child is born, pure. as they grow they will test limits, do things they don't know any better are wrong, and learn in the process by cause & effect. <br>  if the parent doesn't use punishement for bad behavoir, why wouldn't a child do it again? who cares, becuase it didn't earn them grounding, spanking or time out. <br>  mouthy kids are mouthy becuase they weren't told to respect their parents. kids that run wild at the store weren't taught how to act civilized from the first. kids that hit, weren't taught not to use violence to solve problems. everyone has their own parenting tecniques. the main goal is to raise your children to be succsessfull, compassionate, sympathetic, independent , kind hearted adults. not every adult will have the qualities that you werew hoping for, but i truly beleive that 90% of that is becuase of how they werw raised. if a child is raised by parents who doesn't care, that are lazy slobs, no responsibility, jackasses, the kids usually grow into their mirror image. the same reason why abused kids sometimes grow up to become abusers, if they don't get the proper help they need. or they might go the exact opposite, which is just as common. i had a friend grow up in the nastiest house you have ever seen, yet she keeps her home immaculate. who really knows?? i don't think anyone does. i just am positive that i will raise my kids the best that i can. that way if they grow up to be the way i envision, i can say "yep, i raised them right!" or if they don't, i can still say i did my best. and everyones best is different than the other.<br>  i guess i should add- that i do beleive the enviroment and society does have something to do with it. but as parents, its our job to "control" that "something" if i found out my daughter was hanging around a person that smoked weed, me being her parent, would talk to her about the problems associated with that, and ask her not to hang around with her anymore. if she chooses to still hang with her, it is my job to forbid it, and deal with it from there. i will always give my children  the chance to make the right decision on their own. and kids that are under the age of 10, enviroment and society has absolutely nothing to do with it, at all! thats my opinion-|`|1YHih8wyaa	i do. especially when i see 7 year olds controlling their parents and bad mouthing them. if i ever did that id probably loose a tooth. moral of the story my moms had me on check but i still wuv her and appreciate how she raised/diciplined me because otherwise who knows how i would have turned out.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	I Agree and Disagree.<br>  <br>  I agree, because kids fight over the stupid stuff now. Like my best friend and her brother had a fight about who's more spoiled. And its like sad they like to think themselves as spoiled. Also parents aren't home and around their children as much as they "used to be back in the day" so the kid is basically raising him or her self. And not enough rules. I hate it when parents don't have enough or to much rules.<br>  <br>  But <br>  <br>  I disagree. Because sometimes its the child that trys to rebel AGAINST everything even if its fair or not even bad. Us kids got so whiny because we will see a rich and spoiled kid and we want to be JUST like them. and to everyone in school that "our parents are the best and buy us the world"|`|sxecXFgraa	Parents are not the only influence in a child's life so to put the blame solely on them is not right.  However if the parent chooses to ignore their child or let them do whatever because they don't want to deal with them, then yes, they are bad parents.  Some kids are bad because the parents didn't raise them to be respectful of others.<br>  <br>  For the first answer, a hyper active child is not a bad child and medication is not always the best answer.|`|HypqcnJaaa	Disagree. Your parents have a strong influence on who you grow up to be, but they do not determine who you will become.You are amongst your peers/ other people (not family) for about half your life, and that ends up impacting your personality. Also, a lot of children are really sneaky nowadays and their parents don't know much about what's going on in their lives. Now, that is not entirely the parent's fault, but both child and parent should work on keeping the communication lines open.|`|gwK3ouVlaa	Yes I agree to a certain level. I think they can be when their parents have lots of children and cannot control them, when they are drunks or do drugs, lazy, not bother working their whole life etc <br>  Children learn from this if their mum's and dad's. <br>  <br>  Also if parents are too overprotective their children can tend to be rebellious and go way out of line. <br>  <br>  But there are times when the parents are brill but their children fall into the wrong crowd and give in to peer pressure.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Your teacher is ignorant.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have seen good kids come from bad homes...bad kids come from bad homes...good kids come from good homes...and bad kids come from good homes.<br>  <br>  Coming from a bad home is no excuse to act up (granted you are old enough to know the difference from what is right and what is wrong) <br>  <br>  But I also believe that if a kid has no direction in the first place, they can be lost if they never find it.<br>  <br>  You also cannot be 14 and blame your behavior on your parents.You are old enough at that age and beyond to know the difference between right and wrong.<br>  <br>  Take my friend and his brother for example.My friend is in college.He also has a part time job.His brother is a drug addict and is homeless.They were both raised with good morals and one was not favored over the other to harbor ill feelings.The parents have no clue what went wrong.<br>  <br>  Each person is responsibile for themselves.<br>  <br>  It all depends really.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Yes i do agree, i however agree that most parents do the best they know how but how many parents actually know things about child rearing and their psychological development. It always irks me when people call their young (only months) child bad. Why would you put that in your child's head that they are bad? all young kids are active bad is completely different. Now a days people just want to feel like they know whats best and don't want any advise from anyone. So many people don't want to deal with their children just being children and are so quick to label them as hyperactive and want to put them on medicine. But how many actually teach their children how to just sit still? They want to allow their children to do whatever they want and ask them to behave and when they don't instead of teaching them they just want to medicate them.<br>  <br>  And you also have to make adjustments for that childs personality so they won't want to rebel at a later age. If you have a teen who likes to go out you have to give them that room to experince things and teach them from their experiences. Have an open relationship and give them their freedoom (with in limits) when they deserve it. Holding a child back and never letting them experience life will only reverse everything you've taught them .<br>  <br>  But i do except that there are exceptions to every rule. But not as many as people like to think.|`|wycisonaaa	The answer is not a simply a matter of yes or no. Parents are responsible for their children and their behavior towards others. Instilling discipline, morality, and education will help guide their children. Depending on each kid, they can be anywhere from open-minded to stubborn. Some catch on quickly, others are harder and often exasperate tired parents.<br>  <br>  Other factors include friendship/relationship problems and the environment. Negativity around the child can cause him or her to feel the same way. People like to fit in, and if that's the only way they will go along. A parent just has to explain that they don't have to be that way, and etc. Still, a teacher should be reasonable. Children are still maturing and blaming the parent 100% is not subjective thinking.|`|yo9XNz61aa	I have to disagree...even some of the best parents have some pretty bad kids...and there are ppl who hardly raise their kids and kids born to drug addicts who excel far better than some who had wonderful parents!  There are exceptions like parents who spoil their kids and dont teach them how to be independent but for the most part I think it also has to do with peers...some younger kids are just hyper active but I think it can be controlled b/c HELLO the parent is the adult but its harder to control the older they get and thats where the whole peers things comes into play!|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Children are from you but they are NOT you...you can only raise them to your liking until school (or daycare if you go to work) then they are also being raised by their careers, teachers (yes teachers raise your kid too..for 6 hrs a day no less) and peers, even the lunch lady has some input.<br>  Some kids can be highly sensitive, others hyper neither is always because of bad parenting.<br>  It takes a village to raise a child?? daycare and school acts as the village...your teacher forgets herself, and if one of her pupils gets out of line she should shoulder at least a fraction f the blame.|`|8uR9MqGKaa	I disagree because I have been there and done that.  I have a teenager in the National Honor Society who has played Varsity since Freshman year, no drugs, alcohol, or late nights.  He has held a job for 2 years and at 17 owns 2 cars.  In his teen ways he gets under my skin at times but that is hardly an issue.  <br>  <br>  Daughter a year and half younger...  If there is a God that is her only hope.  At 15 she has been missing 3 weeks this time and it is around the 15th time she has run off.  No clue if dead or alive.  Why I am up so late worrying for her.  Drugs, alcohol, sex, no school...  Drug rehabs.  You hit a wall of your only recourse is extreme measures which you cannot do as state would get involved.  But you TRY to get the state involved and they do not want to touch it.  <br>  <br>    Exact same backgrounds and polar opposites.  Parenting my ***.  It goes so far and the rest is luck.  Not that if you are not a crappy parent you cannot mess your kid up but not all messed up kids are from bad homes.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I agree with it somewhat. Have you ever heard of the saying "You're a product of your environment" ?<br>  <br>  If a child was raised in a home with violence, that child is going to grow up thinking that violence is okay. For an example, if somebody was beat as a child, the chances of that child growing up and beating their own family are high. That doesn't necessarily mean that it's ALWAYS going to end up like that, because it doesn't.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Not at all - you can raise a perfect child and it only takes one 'friend' to lead them down the wrong road.<br>  Children are influenced by friends, tv, schoolmates, teachers - everyone else as well as parents, it's unfair to blame just them.|`|ZlzsuDp3aa	Technically, thats what everyone says. Most likely its the truth. Children act upon how they are focused on their parents actions, and behavior. Alot of the time, they like to try and copy a parent, friend or family member. For example, if a child is brought up around parents who curse, and act out on eachother, the child is likely to do the same. Its ashame, because its really not the kids fault. A good behavior, would be sharing time equally between parents and sharing the good behavior, and (alot of parents reward their kids) on good behavior. I do agree with this, that if a child is brought up around bad behavior, they will most definatly do the same.|`|YHwAOEUYaa	parents can teach a kid right from wrong ALL DAY LONG but it's the kids job to listen and learn<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  its not ALWAYS bad parenting though sometimes it is|`|JZe5Hy77aa	i disagree because most kids rebel or misbehave because of a lake of attention. they act like that to get the attention they eryn for|`|biBJAzUoaa	i think so

Se per te la scelta più giusta è di addottare un figlio per scelta e non, come dire.... costretta perchè non puoi farne a meno, allora sia!<br>  Già un figlio è una scelta, c'è chi non desidera averne, perciò scegliere di condividere la vita con un figlio è una scelta seria che impegna per la vita. poi scegliere di addottalo è un altra scelta, ma non s'è un giusto ed un sbagliato.... nella vita si fanno scelte tutti i giorni, e questa è una... certo, una importante... ma è pur sempre una scelta.<br>  Il matrimonio, la convivenza, i figli, le addozioni.... sono questioni che hanno sempre diviso le persone... io sono del parere che su questo non c'è un giusto ed un sbagliato... quello che può sembrare ovvio per me, può essere assolutamente il contrario per qualcun altro, ma non c'è un unica via  per determinare cosa è megli e cosa è peggio, cosa è giusto e cosa è sbagliato.... non fare figli non è un atto di egoismo... perchè dovrebbe esserlo... è forse un incomprensione con il tuo "lui"?.... Certo che all'interno di una coppia bisogna condividere queste scelte o quanto meno riuscire a trovare un equilibrio sulla questione perchè è una questione piuttosto rilevante all'inerno di un rapporto... potrei capire che un uomo si senta privato di un senso di paternità, del desiderio di avere una creatura generata da se stesso e parte di te... ma anche questo... è questione di scelte... certo non si può condannare qualcuno perchè desidera di avere un figlio proprio, inffondo questop desidero nasce dal profondo, è  un desiderio istintivo piuttosto che un ragionamento meditato e ragionato.... però anche quello che dici tu è gisto, perchè è quello che senti... ed è anche una scelta coraggiosa!<br>  Il mio unico parereperciò è: bisogna essere coerenti sia con se stessi che con i desideri della coppia... ed essere uniti in questa scelta!|`|65f035a3719f4b209f7f68fa29d946a8aa	Certo che è una libera scelta ed è bellissimo adottare un bambino il vero problema è che l'addozione non è facile a livello burocratico, io e mio marito aspettiamo la terza figlia ma non avremmo mai potuto adottarne uno perchè non siamo sposati.|`|HL9rSbBmaa	beh ognuno fa quello che vuole... se una donna non desidera figli che non li faccia.... in quanto all'adozione, mi chiedo perchè una che non desidera figli dovrebbe desiderare di adottarli...|`|f13a383928f185137c089fa578b6cf92aa	La scelta di avere dei figli, naturali, è una decisione che va presa nella più totale serenità e convinzione riguardo alla strada che si sta intraprendendo,<br>  Se ci sono dei problemi fisici, è giusto che entrambe i partner ne siano correttamente informati e che insieme sentano anche pareri di specialisti al riguardo.<br>  Ma alla fine i figli li devi fare tu e se per qualche motivo non vuoi, nessuno ha il diritto di costringerti...|`|f32U2Eytaa	io posso ma non ne voglio.<br>  e credo che molte donne facciano figli + per " pressione" sociale che per un vero desiderio.|`|79c120aab65106c91b1e607e292292cfaa	Certo che e' una libera scelta e nessuno ti punta contro una pistola per fare figli. <br>  Inoltre se opti per l'adozione dimostra che non sei affatto una persona egoista, anche se a mio avviso non lo sono nemmeno le persone che scelgono di non avere figli.<br>  Io ne vorrei una valanga, ma non per questo giudico chi non ne vuole.

Per qunato riguarda l'adozione, è un'ottima cosa, anzi sicuramente un gesto di nobiltà d'animo...ma un bimbo adottato per quanto tu gli voglia bene, e lo ami non sarà mai come un figlio tuo...presumo comunque che tu non abbia figli altrimenti non faresti domande del genere...fanne uno e poi vedrai che questa tua domanda ti sounerà assolutamente vouta, stupida e banale.

Cx5Zo7IIaa	I've read thast adjusted for body weight differences a baby who has nursed from a marijuana smoking mother get less than 0.8% marijuana mertabolites. Metabolites are whats left after the drug is done metabolixing (just left overs, that have no potentcy; this also what is picked up on drug tests), so the infant is not getting any substantial amount of drug. Your baby is not getting high!<br>  <br>  from Cannabinoids - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>  Quote:<br>  The endocannabinoid 2-AG has been found in bovine and human maternal milk.  <br>  <br>  and Breast milk - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>  Quote:<br>  Mother's milk has been shown to supply a type of endocannabinoid (the natural neurotransmitters which marijuana simulates), 2-Arachidonoyl glycerol.  <br>  <br>  Press About Marni Jackson - Pain, the fifth vital sign<br>  Quote:<br>  The same substance in cannabis that can help people with multiple sclerosis deal with musle spasms, or cancer patients cope with nausea, is present in human breast milk too. Endogeneous cannabinoids, as they're known, are part of the body's own painkilling resources -cousins to more familiar ones like endorphins. Receptors for cannabinoids, located in the brain, spine and peripheral nerves, have just been discovered in the past decade.  <br>  <br>  The endocannabinoid signaling system: a potential target for next-generation therapeutics for alcoholism<br>  Quote:<br>  Endocannabinoids are present in peripheral tissues as well as in the brain, and recently they were found to be present in breast milk.  <br>  <br>  My suggestion for your PPD is to take walks outside in the sunshine, both the walking and sunshine will perk you up.<br>  <br>  All of you who will give me thumbs down blow it out of you @sses, I've spent months researching this and your simply giving me a thumbs down because of your morals not your intelligence.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Aside from being on meds, I do the following to help with my PPD:<br>  <br>  - I set myself a small "challenge" for each day. Nothing major, but something to make me feel like i've achieved something - re doing my nails, washing my hair, tidying my room etc.<br>  - I try and go out for a walk with my daughter every day, even if it's just up the road and back.<br>  - (This sounds silly, but it does work) I look at myself in the mirror and tell myself I am a good mummy.<br>  <br>  I felt EXACTLY the same as you do. I had no bond with my daughter, she felt like someone else's baby, I looked after her cos I "had" to, not cos I wanted to. She's 6 weeks old now and I have literally today only just felt bonded with her 100%. Don't have a closed mind when it comes to meds - there are meds that are safe for breastfeeding, i'm on sertraline and they have helped a lot. They helped "clear" my head. They do help a lot.<br>  <br>  Don't worry hun, things will start getting a lot easier for you in time, you just gotta be patient. Hugs and good luck xx|`|4e67Pdfvaa	I may sound annoying but excersise releases the same hormone in your body that anti depressents release.  Also a healthy diet is actually proven to reduce signs of depression as well.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I know it is hard, but that is great you are getting help from a doctor.<br>  <br>  I've been there, done that (not PP depression, but depression/anxiety/OCD.)  I never wanted to be "put on a bunch of meds" either...and so I would self-medicate like you do as that would temperarily balance me out.  Depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain, and those meds they prescribe restore the proper balance.  I understand it may not be the best solution for everyone, but I am so glad I went that route.  I no longer require the meds or the therapy and am doing very well.  Just keep an open mind until you can talk to your doctor...Best of luck!|`|UUysEV0yaa	You already know the right answers, you just have to listen to yourself.<br>  <br>  Stop smoking, thats the most important thing. Smoking will pass through your milk and into the baby. Its harming your child.<br>  <br>  Because you had signs of depression before your daughter was born, yes you are more likely to develop post partum depression. <br>  You do need to speak up about this. Talk to your husband when he gets home, tell him the truth. It will be emotional for you and him but you have to do it. Do you have family/good friends near by? Talk to them, let them know how hard it is for you and that you need their help and understanding.<br>  <br>  Yes, you need to talk about this to your doctor on Monday. They can help you. Out you in touch with support services/groups with other mums feeling the same way/counselling and yes, maybe medication. But not against your will. Its up to you to decide the sort of help you accept.<br>  <br>  Everyone has good and bad days, especially as a mother to a newborn infant. Its hard work, thats for sure. You are sleep deprived, tired, frustrated, feeling guilty, nervous, even a bit angry. These feelings will get better, but first you have to seek help. And accept it.<br>  <br>  No one will judge you. No one will think that you are a bad mother. <br>  You are not a bad mother, if you were you wouldnt be seeking help for this. You take care of your baby, making sure she is fed and changed.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with everything, I know you will do the right thing for yourself, your baby and your husband.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	First off- QUIT SMOKING THE WEED. It is not only bad for you, it is bad for your daughter and if you are a decent human being which I think you are because you are trying to get help then you wouldn't have it around any baby whether it was yours or not. Your doctor will prescribe you a medication but it's only to help you. I would also advise getting a psychiatrist as well to help you. Don't be afraid to ask for help from other people until you can get yourself better. Remember that she is completely dependent on you and the choices that you make will affect her for the rest of her life. If you need someone to talk to who won't judge you or be harsh feel free to email me. I dealt with depression my whole life and it got worse after I had my first child. I took medication and it helped a lot but I also talked to a therapist and that has helped immensely. Good luck hon and remember to be honest with your dr so that they can help you with everything!|`|x1DIXrNDaa	fish oil helps.. you can google and research it. i take nordic naturals free of mercury because i am breastfeeding|`|AA11018222	Get a part-time job or take on some volunteer work with a flexible schedule.  You might find that being away from your baby once or twice a week will make you miss her and love her more.  <br>  <br>  Start exercising.  Exercising is a natural mood enhancer.<br>  <br>  Join a support group.  Sometimes being around others going through the same thing helps.  You might try something like narcanon or alanon considering the weed.  They talk about alot more than the weed.  They have many different groups in one city for alanon.  You might want to look for a mother's group.<br>  <br>  Relax.  You are doing a great job.  The baby will grow up however they grow up no matter what you do.|`|GNLYxY7kaa	honey, the best advice i can give you is put down the pipe and realize you need some medications. i too have smoked (not pregnant and not breastfeeding!! but as a way to get to sleep at night) and i noticed the next day i felt extremely depressed. i stopped and feel better. i too had post partum depression. i am a stay at home mom and my husband works 12 hours a day. my son also had colic from 1-4 months so it was CRYING all the time! i was going insane!! plus i would cry cry cry and have panic attacks even in my sleep. i too did not want to go on my meds but let me tell you, i am now back to normal. i started off on an anti depressant but it made me irritable and hyper. they added lamictal which is a mood stabilizer and now i am as happy as can be, no anxiety, less depression (yes i still have my moments but is normal), and i love getting out. if you dont feel like you 'love' the baby that is something you need to address. im sure what you are going through is only temporary, just get the help you need to love your child and take good care of them. god bless|`|YQ45AV3iaa	The expectant woman is now the mother of a newborn but after giving birth is more likely to suffer PostPartum Depression (PPD), particularly if you have any of the factors that increase the risk of developing this condition.<br>  <br>  A healthy pregnant woman should not suffer from PostPartum depression but having a medical history of mental illness increases the risk to suffer it, the same as those women who already had any kind of clinical depression.<br>  <br>  Emotions also take a direct part in developing this type of depression, particularly observed in women with perfectionist personalities that simply do not want to accept the baby as is but somewhat discouraged because the baby does not meet all their demands or expectations.<br>  <br>  In addition, the difficulties experienced by the woman during her pregnancy increases a PostPartum Depression risk, including a death or illness in the family, marital stress, lose of confidence, moving to a new home, or any other issue that occurred during pregnancy when women are more vulnerable to stress, anxiety and depression.<br>  <br>  A woman suffering PostPartum Depression should join a support group to reduce the stress and anxiety levels associated with this condition. In fact, there are groups for pregnant women organized by communities and hospitals in which the participants help each other to relief this pain and the isolation that comes after having given birth.<br>  <br>  Communication with your husband, family and friends is also crucial to avoid depression or aiding in getting rid of it and getting back to your normal activities, including having sex plus caring for your newborn.|`|qqiVKUBpaa	Listen to your doctor. And try to be positive, usually ppd only lasts several weeks if that. You'll probably be out of this funk before you know it. Meanwhile talk to a friend or relative about how you're feeling, have them watch the baby and get out of the house! Go get a manicure or something. Some sunshine and fresh air will do you good. Maybe shop for some cute baby clothes for your daughter. Maybe the fun of it all will help you feel excited about your baby girl and feel a connection with her. Do something to nurture yourself and it will help you get through this rough time and be a better mom to your baby.<br>  <br>  Get well soon!

OgzHcNMsaa	I shower every day..but I have let myself go a bit. I used to always have my hair done, eyebrows etc. Now I just dont have the time|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I bathe every day, or every second day.  It depends on how my day goes.  I don't wear makeup, I never did so that is not something I have let go.  I have my hair up in a ponytail most days.  I do wear sweats, but that is because they are comfortable for me.  My husband appreciates me for me, not how I look around him.  However, I would dress up if we were going out somewhere.|`|AA11210211	I did for awhile but then I couldn't stand it anymore,I have a 3 1/2 yr old and a 1 yr and I shower everyday and normally wear jeans and a t-shirt no makeup but I do blow dry my hair and straighten it.I don't get overly dresses up but I am presentable!!! lol|`|F8KmTbqjaa	No I have not let myself go!  I take a shower before my daughter and I go out everyday and put on a little make-up at least and do my hair if I have time.  I also go to the gym at least twice a week.  My husband works 16 hour days sometimes up to 5 days a week so im alone a lot.  Its no excuse to skip a shower for days!!!!!!  I promised myself that I would still make time for myself even if it was only a 10 minute shower while my daughter is napping.............you should too.  It only gets harder to fit time in for yourself as they get older and more demanding!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  As far as sweats go, I have cute like sweat pants outfits with  matching jacket that I wear out, but I don't wear my PJ pants and a nasty old t-shirt out!|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Yeah, definitly.  I used to be someone who showered every day, and now it's every other.  She's 4.5 months, and up until she was like 12 weeks, I also like you would skip two in a row too.  She was very colicky, and I'm a single mom, so I didn't really have time to shower.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I take a shower daily, brush my teeth and wash my face.<br>  <br>  I don't wear make up, I don't even blow dry my hair. Not enough time in the day. I don't wear sweats though, its not my style. I do wear t-shirt and jeans most days though.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	sadly yes the only thing i do is have a bath every night mainly coz i have another baby due and couldnt bear to go into labour un clean!!!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I have three kids. I shower when the older two go to bed and then my hubby can watch the baby who is three months old. I usually am awake before they are so that is when I do my hair. I've never been much of a make up person so I don't do it unless it's a special occassion like a family wedding or gong on a date with my hubby. Most days I wear comfy pants but if I am going out I'll put clothes on. I still like to look nice for my hubby though!|`|6gtgiCS7aa	Well, I am not a stay at home Mom because I don't have kids (yet ... I'm pregnant, though!), but I do work from home. I never wear makeup anyway, but I kind of lounge around in my most comfy clothes (sweats are rarely a good choice in the Caribbean where I live). Sometimes I don't comb my hair much and I keep it pinned up alot (or it gets in the way). When he's home I let it down because he likes it like that. I do bathe every day, though. I don't think he'd let me sleep beside him if I didn't.<br>  <br>  At least make a little bit of an effort. Bathe. Comb your hair. Put on lip gloss when you know he's almost home. All that combined could take 15 or 20 minutes and you may feel better about yourself. But I don't have a 5-month old.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I wear comfy clothes like sweats and rarely do my makeup. My husband doesn't mind. I would rather wear the comfy clothes all day and not look fashionable than wear something nice for my son to get ketchup all over. I have found that if I take the time to fix my hair then I look okay even if I'm wearing sweats.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I need to do my hair and make up in the morning.. I can't stand not getting ready. I would probably go insane, because I get the feeling of laziness when I do nothing with my face/hair. But, I do wear sweats and a shirt that is way too big for me around my hubby.. he doesn't mind it (so he says LOL)|`|SjX72fPyaa	Haha yeah. I wear my pj' all day unless I have running around to do that day, only wear make up when were going out to a bar or something, and there have even been some days when I don't even brush my hair. Today is one of those days! lol|`|GVPhFa3Raa	Yes Yes Yes!! Im Not the Only One! We All Do Itr Im Sure..<br>  Who On Earth has Time When They Are A Stay At Home Mom? Esp With A baby!!<br>  <br>  My Daughter Is 6Months.. I Lounge around In My Pj's All Day Some Times.. hair A Mess.. never Go Out With Make Up On Unless For A Night out! <br>  <br>  I Feel I Have Let My Self Go Sooo Much Since Before I Was Always.. hair make Up Dress Smart!! Even if I Was Staying In Lol.<br>  <br>  But hey.. We All Need Days Were We Do Nothing With Ourselvs!!<br>  xxx|`|EeGgovyCaa	At least you have an excuse to stay home. I have let myself go, but I have to get up for work. Look like crap everyday because I'm too tired to primp my hair.|`|aTyNsdApaa	Yes, but I think it has to do with the fact that I am pregnant with the second and am still having morning sickness. My hubby also works a lot. I think that I might invest in some cute, kinda sexy pajamas that are very comfortable because that is all that my husband sees me in right now. That way I won't feel bad if I don't get dressed that day. I think that once the weather warms up and I am not sick I will start looking better. You should try forming some mommy play groups with neighbors this will give you some time to relax with other moms. I think you will get very depressed if you don't get out and get dressed and feel good!|`|nwuL7M7saa	Usually while I'm home I wear pajamas or something comfortable. I clean a lot during the day, so I usually take like 2 showers a day. I don't understand how you go a day or so without taking a shower. Even if you're in there 5 minutes, at least you're staying on top of your hygiene. I don't usually wear makeup unless I'm going somewhere, anyway.|`|kXkcxT39aa	I showered everyday, but I did wore sweats more often after giving birth.  It's comfortable and the last thing a new mother need is an uncomfortable pair of bottoms.<br>  As far as make up, I don't wear any, but I did have some days that I will just wash and wear my hair, no time for blow drying or what not.<br>  Don't worry, once your baby becomes mobile, you will find yourself adjusted to the routine and have some time to take care of yourself.  Oh and running after a toddler is a good workout too.|`|yDp2hNc5aa	Yes, I have. I know it does sound gross, but when your kids are really young, getting a shower every day is just pure luck. LOL. <br>  I'm starting to wear make-up again when I go out. I don't care if we're just going out somewhere with my husband and I'm not even getting out of the car. I just need to distinguish between "always inside mom" to "hey world I'm outside!"<br>  <br>  Is this your first child? It gets better and sometimes crazier. Especially if your kids are about 2 years apart. But I wouldn't change their age difference for anything.|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	I did at first. Now my daughter is 10 months old and I'm starting to take a little better care of myself. I'm still not wearing makeup but I just got my eyebrows done and I am so excited to get a facial this weekend. I'm starting to wear my hair down which is a vast improvement from my sloppy bun. Our husbands love us because of who we are. After the miracle of childbirth my husband has never thought I was more beautiful despite my stretch marks and sloppy clothes. The one thing I have kept up is showering but only because I take a shower with my baby and husbands help.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	I try my best but some days I just don't feel like it. Hubby works nights so I do ALL the night stuff. Because he works nights and sleeps during the day I can only have a bath/shower of a night time so can't do my hair or anything because it'd wake up baby. I Think he's used to it now anyway.<br>  <br>  I still try and put makeup on when I go out though, let my son play on his mat or in his jumperoo for 5 minutes.|`|08GDBedGaa	well, i still have 3/4 of my baby weight(6months later), i also shower every2 days, i try to get dressed & baby dressed,  even if we don't go out(which we try to do everyday, but its so wintery here in europe)!! but by about 5, it's contacts out, glasses on and tracksuit on!! :) i don't really were make up so that's cool!! :) funny how you change, b4 baby, i spent lots of time preening myself, :)|`|mAJZFmIEaa	i dress the same, my hair is always done and i shower everyday. If my little girl isn't asleep when i take a shower i put her in her rocker and take it to the bathroom with me, she just loves seeing mummy and daddy take a shower. But it will be winter in a few months so i won't be doing that then. And i've never worn make-up.|`|96RRWgQ2aa	Well I'm a single mom and I work a part time job (I live with my mom) but I don't wear make up when i am home during the day taking care of my son.<br>  Usually I work out every day for at least a half an hour, I shower everyday, and I almost always wear makeup when I go out.|`|h90Uobyyaa	I was fully prepared to let myself go- even bought 7 pairs of pajamas so i could just relax but to my surprise no. I shower every morning. Dry and straighten my hair. And get dressed in clothes. Even if im not leaving the house. I just do it as part of my sons routine so its now easy and just part of the day. What a waste of pajamas! lol|`|hitgP4Hoaa	god yea i am the same, i was as a one who  would never leave the room until i had my make up done and my hair done as well always looks after my nails the whole girlie thing, its all gone now since i had my baby well he is 14 months now so im not finding it as hard to do myself up but im only coming back to it now. my boyfriend didn't no what was happening with me with no face on i say he taught he had another women in the house lol.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	I am the same way 100 percent i barely get to take a shower i hate it im always in pjs and just messy hair ...but i promised myself this summer i will look good and try hard but i doubt it will happen lol.
Ya1zZORIaa	Okay first of all, that is the cutest baby in your display picture. If she is yours, congratulations because she is soo cute!<br>  Lol on to your question...<br>  I really like Annalise and Jennifer. Both of those are pretty! I would spell it Annalese though, and if you like that name you might like Annaleigh. That is such a beautiful name in my opinion! Good luck choosing!|`|xglOR1bXaa	Jennifer, Chloe & i like Nicole, not Nicola...|`|cErLq7f3aa	1. Marie Louise<br>  2. Katy<br>  3. Kristin<br>  4. Ellen<br>  5. Annalise|`|YcLImmyraa	I like Annalise, Ellen and Katy. I think Ellen's my favourite, it's so classic and pretty!|`|pCbzhOrkaa	Annalise is one of my favorite names! Ellen, Chloe and Jennifer are also really cute|`|AA10325228	I like Chloe and Annalise|`|5vtVsqx6aa	My favorite out of these is Annalise.  <br>  <br>  My next favorites are Nicola and Katy because they are a little different.<br>  <br>  The others are too common in my opinion.|`|iDgBIpdMaa	Teresa, Chloe, Annalise, Kristin.|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Chloe is beautiful. Eleanore would also be nice spelt Eleanor. Great names :)|`|SoR6DQvRaa	Ellen but do you like Kera pronounced like kara|`|nzXzh8gAaa	i think Annalise is rly cute!|`|757f469b68fd26c1194a8d3761d9b0b6aa	i love the name Teresa.|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	out of those I like Ellen|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Of these, my favorite is Chloe.|`|3S2gw8D1aa	What a cutie pie! Such a cute picture.<br>  My favorite girl name on your list is Katy, I've always thought it was such a charming name. I prefer the Katie spelling, but this would work just fine, with Katy there are so many middle name options that would go nicely. My second favorite is Chloe, very cute name and I like that it's spunky as well. Best of luck to you!|`|YvLVuSEcaa	I love Annalise, but I'm always concerned about how it kind of spells Anal, and how they may be teased...although I considered it for my daughter, but it doesn't go with my last name.  I would maybe try spelling is Annelise?|`|ZlzsuDp3aa	Well on your list i like:<br>  <br>  Kristin. And for her middle name, maybe: Marie, Elizabeth, Nicole|`|2pQUMKb2aa	Kristin Jennifer Chloe and Annalise|`|BhPXehldaa	I like Chloe. Eleanore is my second choice, however I loved Katy Elise.|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	1st off, congratulations if you are pregnnt...<br>  <br>  I like Katy|`|qTKSvULiaa	i like teresa or annalise|`|3d84ec7fe396e7f8d8f95a2831238a5daa	Ii like Annalise, Chole,Katy...my baby girls name is Sophia
kziIf0r6aa	I think it depends on how old the babysitter is, you can get away with paying $30 for a 16 year old but I guess the older they are the more they expect.  If your children are in bed by the time you guys go out for Date Night, and the sitter is there to literally sit and raid your pantry why pay anymore than $30.  If they are expected to feed and bath both kiddies maybe you could think about what you'd expect to be paid if you were sitting for someone.  I think you could even base it on an hourly fee of $10-$15 depends on how long they are expected to sit for and then if you have to drive them across town to their home when you get back.  Tricky one I used to sit when I was alot younger but that's 15 years back now and I would get $30 for a day with two kids under two|`|dr9y4tJsaa	it depends on the age of the babysitter. usually 20/25 dollars for 2 hours or less and 5 dollars for every hour after that. if the babysitter was given short notice you should give a tip|`|OLXv3DEAaa	I think you should ask some other parents in your area how much they pay their babysitters. I used to live in a small town and the average for babysitters was around $5-7 if the sitter was an adult and the kids were awake the whole time. Then I moved to a large city and lowest I ever got as a teenager was $12-13/hr and that was for one sleeping child. It really varies a lot by area and some rates on here could be insultingly low where you live and some may be outrageously high. <br>  <br>  In general though you pay a teenager less and if the sitter is an experienced adult or college student the rate is a little higher. Maybe pay a little more if the sitter will be doing a lot vs just watching kids after you put them to bed.|`|rGci1ehoaa	WHEN I BABYSAT I CHARGED 5BUCKS PER KID PER HOUR... I HAD ALOT OF CLIENTS SO I DONT THINK I WAS ASKING TOO MUCH.. REMEMBER IF THE BABYSITTER HAS CPR CERTIFICATION THEY CAN CHARGE MORE. BUT IF THE KIDS ARE SLEEPING THE WHOLE TIME I CHARGED 20 BUCKS EVEN|`|oiJITSNZaa	The going rate is around $2/hour per child. My son is in preschool where they even use a school curriculum for this rate!|`|gyEfJwItaa	￡8 per hr for both|`|V8wUAVdyaa	is it a teenager?  5 or 6 an hour is plenty for them... or maybe just a standard 30 per night.|`|Rbm99GOcaa	5 dollars per kid per hour and 10 per kid per hour after midnight.<br>  <br>  I am 22 and do a lot of babysitting. I am a good babysitter and now I only go to the houses where I am paid well enough. Some pay be 2 dollars an hour to watch 2 kids and that is not right. Think of minimum wage...you can pay some 14 year old less then that!<br>  <br>  They gave up their time to provide a service for you. Unless your kid is an angel (which I doubt) I would pay them more then you think because you want them to care while their there. Not just ignore the  kids and watch TV.<br>  <br>  Another suggestion is to buy the babysitter food. For example I have this one couple who always leaves me pizza money or buys pizza and pop,chips, rents movies and others things for me when the kids go to bed.<br>  <br>  Believe me if you want a good babysitter, you pay a price. 2 dollars an hour will get you a teenager with her boyfriend over and your kids in front of a TV|`|8U57JQKyaa	I used to babysit like 5 or 6 years ago and I got paid $30 for up to 3 hours and then $10 every hour after that. I thought that that was really good.
8a0b3f29a7fc8ca3aea88a0c0237468caa	You should take a test today.  Good luck!!!!!!|`|29def52ac159fbd3d1d0ef706db268a9aa	Anywhere after 10 DPO you can test +<br>  <br>  So test. Good luck!<br>  Ash

Iks1qdElaa	Absolutely, I felt the changes in my body almost immediately. It all depends on how well you know your body. This doesn't mean you're pregnant though. They now have tests to find out from the week after conception. I suggest getting one.|`|8abec49c1ea367f1fcc8f56913503a66aa	Yes it is possible if u had intercouse on ur fertile days. pregnancy symptoms may start at 7 days after conception an breast tenderness is one such early symptom. but  Breast tenderness can be a significant sign of PMS also.|`|3dDGr9kHaa	I am having tender and swollen breasts and have been since ovulating around the 18th or 19th...I feel so sure but then I am worried it might be AF coming.  Only thing is, I don't seem to get PMS symptoms normally.  I believe it is possible you are pregnant but you will have to wait and see just like me.|`|AA11821229	Sore breasts could be anything. You could of slept on them wrong, it could be hormones, your period fixing to start etc etc.<br>  You could be pregnant but, I wouldn't think after only 1 week your breasts are sore. Although morning sickness isnt suppose to start until about the 6th week and mine started a couple days after I got pregnant.
ApQq8ppfaa	If you are his father I don't think it will take much to make him a raging acoholic.

knJbfYNbaa	When they are in the teething process more saliva is produced.  <br>  They use the saliva to make sounds, it is part of pre-speech development.<br>  It is normal and kinda cute except during a feeding!|`|9kIBkiznaa	becuase they're cute|`|AA10313192	learning to make sounds that way|`|KQk8oevaaa	because they are arrogant little brats, my 6 month old did that the other day and I told her as long as she lives under my roof I won't put up with that crap and then she just kinda looked at me like she didn't understand. Actualy I think it is because they are teething watch for low grade fever and have some baby tylenol on hand, ambasol doesn't work, they just swallow it and it can make them nauseous. But I am not convinced that my daughter isn't just being disrespectful.Good luck.|`|f45qYj0Xaa	because there teeth are about to come out and when they chew on the bottle they give it soft on there gum and that helps so the teeth can come out and the baby is going to grow teeth|`|608825b15a0e154019fce4906121ff31aa	its fun and sounds funny!  why not?|`|ijtjErUEaa	don't worry it's completely normal. Mine did it and I wasn't sure why until a tooth came through. Be careful for high fevers and earaches to go along with the teething too.

73f68bc8ffbbc3f6be93b55778882e67aa	You should not be putting cereal in her bottle, she needs to learn to eat on a spoon and she will sleep better if you give her the bath before bed, not in the morining!  That's why she sleeps after a bath, it's relaxing, better to do it at night when you want her to sleep.  Gerber or Heinz, makes no difference.|`|9057d811c051bc48cdeb02a349dfbe9eaa	if your baby is hungry feed her...my daughter was never on a schedule|`|d43AqLygaa	At 4 months your baby doesn't need lunch and dinner. She should only be getting maybe one serving of rice cereal. You should begin introducing fruits/ vegs after 6 months. At around 7-8 months most babies are eating breakfast and dinner. Then gradually introduce lunch as you find your baby is less satisified or hungry in the middle of the day. <br>  <br>  Your baby should be eating around every 2-4 hours (breastmilk or formula) approximately 32 ounces a day.|`|sb1dEaOgaa	I will first say I am an owner operator of a child care for 16 years so this is all from experience. Please never, never put food into a bottle. Children as early as 4 weeks can take food off of a spoon, it just takes time for them to get used to it. Any food in a bottle is a choking hazard, even the specially made bottles. Instead of giving her the cereal in the bottle, just give her milk in the morning and then try a baby food after 1-2 hours. I have used both brands of baby foods and they both seem equal. Try each on your baby and see which they prefer
zZ97JXoLaa	I have 4 kids and I had a very bad miscarriage before my 4the one  I thought I couldn't get pregnant again but 4 weeks later I did and I finally got my girl.

You're body is healing and you might not be in peak condition right now.<br>  <br>  I'd wait, just to be safe.
AA11981363	If you have been regular ever since you had a baby maybe you should test.....I had a baby in january and just started to get mine....test just to be sure.|`|Zop6zF1laa	I think it's normal, but if you'd feel more at ease, you might want to get a test. Ever since I had my baby in December, my periods have actually been worse than they were...more cramps and bleeding. Sometimes it comes a few days late, but I definately wasn't pregnant. But you might want to get a test so you won't stress yourself about it. My birth control is the little raincoats too! LOL|`|AA10345631	I would say that it's normal, your hormones are still a little screwy at this point, but are you breastfeeding?  If so, this would definately make periods irregular or absent.  I had my 3rd baby in March also, I'm breastfeeding and my periods still aren't regular.  If you're not breastfeeding, your cycle should be back on track sometime after 3 months.  If you are breastfeeding, it's a bit fuzzy as to when your cycle would be back on track because hormones depend on how often and for how long you nurse.  Seeing as your period has been on time since birth, I would test just to be sure.|`|d43AqLygaa	Are you nursing? If you are breastfeeding that can delay your periods. Some women do not get their periods again until they wean their babies. <br>  <br>  If you are not nursing, you could be pregnant. You may want to take a test. It could also be your hormones.

kjgonYlgaa	When my daughter was young, and HEAVILY addicted to her pacifier,     (her pacifier was always kept in the same spot [on her window ledge] and before bedtime she would get herself) I switched it one day with a tiny stuffed toy that she had never seen before, and that night when she reached for her pacifier found a little squirrel.  She looked puzzled and asked about her suzie I played along that it must have fallen out of her window and a momma bird took it back to her nest for her babies (she loved to look at the baby birds in their nest at grandma's house) I distracted her by talking about the birds for a little while, while she held the toy.  When it was time for a story I asked her if she thought she would like to use the squirrel to help her fall asleep.  She thought that was a good idea.  We had to do stories about the baby bird with the pacifiers for the longest time but she never even once cried.  Try something like that with your daughter, but you have to be firm with what you choose to do.  If you keep switching back to allowing her to have it she will know she can win.  Throw the bottle away so you can not give in to her even if you wanted to.  She may go a night or two in a fit of rage but in the end it will work.  Tell her you will take her shopping to get a new straw cup and she can pick which ever one she wants (they make some pretty cool ones) and that can be her new special MILK ONLY cup.  If you're worried about your neighbours (which you shouldn't be because you are not harming your daughter, and other people know how difficult kids can be at times) if she is screaming hystaricly and won't stop, put her in her room and you go sit outside your appartment door.  This will allow her to vent her frustrations and will give you some grown up time (chatting with all your neighbours who pass by) Whatever you do don't give in once you decide how you are going to break her of her bottle. You and she will both be frustrated but very soon she'll forget all about it.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	she is going to keep screaming because she knows thats how she gets the bottle.<br>  endure the screaming a few times and if necessary go to your neighbors and explain what is going on.be apologetic.  they will understand, and after a few times she will stop.<br>  <br>  But the bottles in a box and on the box write "if you give her one, she will never stop wanting one"|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	cold turkey is the only way to do it|`|QqFPNti4aa	Have her give her bottle away to another baby.  And tell her that the new baby needs it now.  Or maybe let her pick something out from the store that she can sleep with instead of the bottle.  If that doesn't work then you may have to let her scream for a while.  Don't give in though once you start.  And nobody is going to do anything to you for trying to get your child off the bottle.(ie: neighbors)|`|0ky4TktEaa	It's really very simple. Take some advil and prepare yourself for a prolonged time of screaming fits. If you're worried about the neighbor's, spend the night at a family member/friend's home where her fits won't draw the wrong kind of attention. When it comes down to it, you just need to tell her no and stick with it. As of now and to her knowledge, screaming long enough and loud enough will get mommy to give her the bottle. You need to be willing to sit there and let her have her fit until she realizes she truly is not getting that bottle. You may have to go through this a few rounds until she understands. Your biggest thing is making sure you don't get lazy and cave in even when you've had a long hard day and don't want to hear it.|`|oiJITSNZaa	it's definitely time for you to get down to serious business and make your child obey. After all who runs the house you or the child? Babies are to be weaned off bottles around 1! A transition would be a nuby soft tip cup that is similar to a bottle then graduate to a sippy cup and so on. Stop letting her win the tantrums....she already knows if she throws one then you will give her what she wants. If you don't want a spoiled lil brat in 5 years then discipline now. It's never too soon.|`|LNLV5rysaa	Amen!!! My daughter is 26 months and I'm going though the same thing. She has a scream that can shatter glass when she gets pissed off enough! The longest I have been able to go is 2 hours with the screaming. Ear plugs, asprin, and a good book. I still caved. We've thrown the ba's (bottle) away, cut the nipple, switched to a slower flow nipple (she just bit a bigger hole) switched milks, I have even put vinegar in the bottles. She threw the vinegar ones at me and told me 'milk'. Talk about stubborn- best of luck someone once told me to fill the nipple with mustard then put milk or whatever in the bottle, place  plastic wrap on the bottle opening then screw on the nipple. I can't bring myself to do it. Sippy cups get thrown if I have milk in them. So I give up...as long as she doesnt take the stupid thing to school I'll be fine. Dentist say's she'll probably need braces anyway (small jaw). No cavities or build up. My thought is atleast it's not a pacifier---those are just ugly in a preschoolers mouth...atleast the bottle can be emptied and left at home.  Good luck!
eXsR8Gx5aa	If you use cloth nappies and breastfeed - nothing at all<br>  if you use disposable and you formula feed - quite a bit more|`|RXAEGB7kaa	the first year you have to buy milk powder ￡7.nappies disposable ￡5,terry nappies ,plastic pants ￡35 for starter kit in mothercare.baby wipes ￡3.when baby reach 6mths you have to buy baby food.i got twins and i was spending ￡60 a week .|`|4iXL4C6paa	let me see:<br>  <br>  diapers $10<br>  baby food $20<br>  wipes $10<br>  baby bath and etc. $10<br>  bought him a jumperoo this week $75<br>  <br>  $125<br>  <br>  ....I guess that is pretty much all for this week but it changes weekly, he is only 5 1/2 months., but yeah it can get pretty expensive.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	It all depends on your lifestyle and choices.....but babies dont "cost" anything, caring for them does and it is for 18+ years not a week :)|`|N0KRZ9sXaa	cost all depends on how you would bring the baby up.. breast is not only best but cheaper than bottles and their is no need to clean bottles and warm them up, nappies you can go for disposible ones which are easier but in the longer run cost more and not good for the enviroment and the re-usable ones really good but if you havent the time abit harder, things also to consider how far do you live from drs and hospital do you drive or will you be using other ways of transport which the costs do add up! Then you get the unexpected things you have to buy.. their is no amount to say but they are not cheap!|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	My daughter was the first grandchild so her crib, changing table, carseat, etc. were bought at baby showers. I breast feed, cloth diaper, a use coupons like crazy. Some weeks we don't spend anything. I make laundry detergent which costs me 2.00 to make 160 loads worth and I wash the diapers in this.  A few cents to wash and dry the diapers 2-3 times a week. Baby cereal is like 1.75 and lasts at least a month. Baby food is probably a 1.00 a day but sometimes I make her baby food which is way cheaper. It's really all about how you raise your baby. Do you want to buy a new toy every week, bottle feed, have the most expensive disposable diapers. I think you determine how much it will cost.|`|KDb96QS7aa	There are so many variables.<br>  <br>  Try this: <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/babyCostCalculator.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/babyCostCalcul...</a><br>  <br>  This will at least give you the estimate for the first year and you can divide it by 52. Breaking it down weekly doesn't make much sense since there are so many big purchases (like a carseat, stroller, etc...things that cost in the hundreds but you only buy once).|`|ZlzsuDp3aa	Diapers, Milk (if you use formula) <br>  - When you have doctors appts, its a copay.<br>  - New clothing<br>  - Toys<br>  - Furniture<br>  <br>  About a week: Id say $250, 300 dollars .|`|DFAS6jRRaa	Well nappys $15 a week, formula $30 a week, clothes, bath products, wipes. Its alot. Could be 50-60 a week easily. It depends how you do things.|`|z6IekuwSaa	I got all the stuff she needed clothes and furniture wise at the baby shower. All I had to buy was diapers and wipes. So just about $80 a month.

If they are born with a disease that needs medication. if you breastfeed or bottle feed

aab30902c32aa18d4eeead9019224c2aaa	On a trip, no big deal as long as you have a normal father-daughter relationship.  Especially no big deal, as two other sisters will be in another bed in the same room.<br>  <br>  If the idea bothers you, though, that's what's important.  Check to see if you can get a roll-away bed at the hotel/motel.

I never saw any problem with sharing a bed with either my father or mother.  For that matter I was the youngest of three children who was the only boy and I slept with my sisters until I was a teen.  My sisters were good to me and never did anything that would be inaproprate.  Parents and siblings do not pose any problem to me.|`|kziIf0r6aa	Yes sleep on the floor I think there comes a time when even Dad should see that it weird and really shouldnt be done.

Jonica is really weird.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|2fae7dd0a04dbed0171cdbe8a5530620aa	no... i wuldnt put the fathers name in a baby girls name because it dosent sound or look right... he can pick a name but having his name in it is not cool in my opinion. because in the future it can come back to bite. jonica is not a ver good name.. sory. wha about Janay, Janelle, Josiline, Jayel... im pregnant with triplets and  the dads name is Jonathan... i wuldnt name my kid Jonathena,,, or Jona..... mb Jhenna... but not with his name in it.|`|3GIXfwTdaa	I think it is really cute! Congrats!|`|6Gix1D8Qaa	what about Joanna or Joni I don't like it (sorry)|`|9afb18471eb585337f9884ac9c9a89e8aa	I think it should be pronounced with a softer J to make it more feminine. This way the name "John" doesn't come out in Jonica so hard. : )|`|AA10976473	I like it! It's really original, and there are so many cute nicknames that could come from it. Snaps to you for trying to name her for her dad ..That can be hard to do for girls. :)|`|BL2HITQaaa	I like it...I also like Joni Paige.|`|FyikOA0caa	not a good name if u ask me. wut about something that starts with a J and has your name in it|`|JULpvEG9aa	UM NOT ALL THAT CRAZY ABOUT IT BUT OK|`|MiWhfnkGaa	I like it actually! Would her nickname be Joni (joe-knee) or Joni (John-ee)? <br>  <br>  I like the combo, of course my name is Paige so I might be a little biased. :)  <br>  <br>  Good Luck with your baby girl!|`|Pp29pcRVaa	it stinks.|`|mzfG5mraaa	its not bad, but i wouldnt name my kid that.. its creative though|`|qc6DoZEsaa	um. i dont know. its okay. i think it might be better if it was like johanna, thats what it reminds me of. i think its good your naming her after the father though. and it is a good original name. GO FOR IT!|`|wv33H8QQaa	its ok. i dont really like it. i knew a girl named johnny-may<br>  but it was spelled Jonni-Mae. looked more female. named after her father, john and her mother mae.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Just wait to have a boy and name him John<br>  <br>  I dont like the name Jonica at all- it sounds too masculine.|`|AA12343985	Sorry hon, not crazy about it.|`|42da507b8f3750dfe4a116227bf70752aa	i have a female friend whos name is joni pronounced Jonny and she hates it and if you name your girl this everyone will call her joni (jonny)|`|AA11927595	its different. Im not sure if its a good different or a bad different tho.|`|Qjho2dd3aa	I kind of like it but not that much|`|b721320cfcaaf3f39ec1642828d8a203aa	i like paige jonica better i think jonica is going to be hard for others to pronounce and a hiunder to your angel
6a6c83f0712736b72dcc0dab2a8ad50faa	Yes I have used it and yes it did work great, he didnt have the side effedts but watch your baby close fir it.<br>  For people who have never had a baby with GERD, they have no idea what its really like.  My baby screamed and cryed all day and night long, even woke up from a nap in a shrill scream, It wouldnt have mattered what formula we used.  GERD can damage your babys throat so if shes been diagnosed, I would try Reglan|`|909ba7c765e96de54c9f1a6fd7bdbd5caa	yes, my daughter is taking reglan for same reason.if there's side effects i don't see them w/ my toddler just that it's working for her.<br>  talk to peds first because everyone has different reactions to meds!|`|wRLYHA1iaa	try a formula for Fussy and Gassy Babies - Parents Choice at Walmart was the best one -which is basically Enfimil for under half the price .... but WIC would only pay for the Similac down here which wasnt as good because our son spit up a little with the Similac and it was the Similac Advanced Plus Iron that was causing most of his problems . that and he could not breathe because his Trachea Flap was too weak for him to be on his back so he was "grunting" which meant he was having all kinds of respritory problems simply because we listened to the "make him sleep on his back " nonsense;he could not breathe and was only getting 45 minute naps .. as soon as I put him to sleep on his belly the grunting stopped and he slept 6 hrs at a time ...... also laying your baby on her belly causes gas to dispell so during play time or if she is screaming during or after a feeding give the baby some "tummy time" ..... they presecribed us Zantac but I quit giving it to him and switched his formula to "for fussy and gassy babies" and put him to sleep on his belly and problems solved !!
xoq83Yckaa	Oh man, i could definitely join your club. I've been having the hormone day from hell. i just couldn't stop being upset. Some days i'm fine, but other days i feel sorry for anyone that gets in my way. I was to the point where i just got back into my pj's in the late afternoon and got right back into bed and i stayed there crying my heart out and being angry. Until i felt a bit better a few hours later and now i feel ok.<br>  <br>  I've learned to just let it out and then try to relax. Anything at all that's stressing me out, i just push it out of my mind and i refuse to do anything that isn't absolutely necessary. My partner had to work today too, so feeling alone doesn't help, but he can call me from work, just talking to him for 2 minutes helps. <br>  <br>  Just remember that its the hormones messing with your head and making you feel like crap, it won't last forever, just try to relax until it passes. the people around you should hopefully understand, i just tell ppl later that i'm sorry, i don't mean it and thats its frustrating for me too.<br>  |`|kk8ypSTSaa	aw, we all have those days. take it easy. its your hormones talking! best of luck. |`|RE6GBw0Baa	aww hunni u know its just hormones,<br>  <br>  i get horrible when AF arrives, due to dissapointment and pmt but at least u have an excuse lol.(mines not exactly obvious)<br>  <br>  just take advantage of being a cow 2day, maybe u could ring sum1 uv never really liked and tell them what u think...then blame it on the hormones hahahaha (maybe the MIL) xxxx<br>  <br>  hun just enjoy being a cow.<br>  <br>  but seriously ur hubby and friends all understand and they love u xxxxx|`|140cce30c520501bb06fc1fc9d65ca79aa	I am having a bad day, but I cant compete with yours but you did ask so yeah, I couldn't sleep all night was thinking too much and a bit of anxiety.|`|yAihdqw0aa	i cut myself<br>  <br>  joking joking<br>  umm play nintendo wii<br>  wii sports is fun|`|c9387f79b14133134f45bd7ea7546614aa	Just hang in there..try and take a deep breath and realize that you're feeling crazy and crappy because of the pregnancy hormones.  All of these are symptoms of pregnancy...and that is a good thing.   I find myself crying a lot.. and then laughing at my unstable emotions later.  Take one day at a time and try to do other things to get out your frustration other than screaming. I know isn't it SO frustrating to be sick all the time. I know it gets depressing but it may ease up for you in time.  What you're going through sounds totally normal.  Chances are you'll start to feel better soon..and if not ask your doctor if there's anything they can do about the morning sickness.|`|iAQKD2YBaa	Do you know how much your body and emotions are going through at the moment ?  You have just gone through 19 weeks of the most changes that your body will ever have.  Don't feel bad or try to explain why you are feeling this way, it is all part of your body reacting to all that is going on. I am not going to say it is hormones because I hated to hear that word when I was pregnant (It was like there was an excuse for being upset). Put on your running shoes - not that you will be able to use them for that for the next 21 weeks) and go for a walk or call a friend and go for a coffee. Your feelings have already passed and the best thing for you is to go and look after "you". Maybe even go and get yourself a manicure or pedicure. |`|AZSIoSNoaa	I am having a day similar, only I haven't had a wreck today(yet). Bad days come and go, and the hormones make them even worse, especially for the ones that are around us. Go do something that you have fun doing, use as a relaxer, cause stress ain't good for you or the baby. Good luck, and I will keep you in my prayers. |`|slzx5202aa	Yep i am right there with you. From the second i opened my eyes this morning i knew i was bound to be a devil woman today, i have been in a very bad mood because i didn't sleep very well last night due to severe heartburn. These hormones are really taking it out of me.But it's just something you have to expect during pregnancy.It's all worth it though : ) hopefully tomorrow things will get better.|`|SIK58haraa	just wait till your 36 weeks like I am. Every tiny thing is such a challange. My husband keeps asking for sex and I want to punch him in the face. I have a 3 yr old who needs and wants attention and I feel like a complete failure because I can't take him anywhere. My tummy aches all the time and I just want her out now so life can return to normal...|`|FLFBCVhUaa	Monday wasn't a good day for me. Shame my poor husband puts up with allot. I'm always moaning at complaining to him. Everything that I ate or drank gave me instant heart burn. I was uncomfortable and had serious back pain!! <br>  But today I am in a much better mood. |`|hQ8XgFQJaa	I has a bad day and to top it off I had to sit my english language exam, I really just need a break. Congratulations on your pregnancy, hope all goes well!|`|E3q5Rkrbaa	No, my day has been dandy thank you. |`|7W8ihXA4aa	I had this loads earlier on in my pregnancy.  My hormones were all over the place and i felt utterly crap and really quite depressed.  I took it all out on my partner who in turn took it back out on me and we ended up in a right mess.  It turned out one of the reasons i felt so awful was because my iron levels were so low!  I have started taking iron tablets and aside from the odd day where the smallest thing can tip me over the edge, i feel a lot better.<br>  <br>  To make you feel better i took my son trick or treating on halloween and then dropped him off with his dad (around 6.30pm) to go to a party.  I was shattered and wanted to drive straight home but as i set off the petrol light came on, so i couldnt go the short way home i had to go the long way via a petrol station.  I got stopped at the traffic lights on the way there, queued for ages to get my petrol, got stopped at all the lights on the way home and cried for the entire journey.  Looking back i only added about 5 mins onto my journey but it felt like the end of the world.<br>  <br>  I suggest having lots of chocolate (if you can stomach it) and putting your feet up watching something really girly on the tv.  It always makes me feel better.<br>  <br>  If you feel really down i would ask the doctor to check your iron levels as it can be linked to that.  Good luck and congratulations!!|`|8hLsgGKGaa	Awww honey - I am sure everything will be ok.<br>  I am know deep down ur husband wont take it to heart what u said.<br>  Being pregnant isnt easy for anyone even for those having a perfect pregnancy.<br>  <br>  As for feeling sick, cant eat or drink - try having a lay down and sleeping.<br>  I know it might be abit hard for u right now but u need to relax otherwise ur blood pressure is going to go sky high and it isnt good for ur little baby inside u.<br>  Trust me i know, i am always stressing out cause i am always being sick, been going on since week 6 but if u just calm down and do nothing u will be fine.<br>  <br>  I am 30 weeks pregnant now and i feel like the size of a house and a walking teletubbie so i know how u feel.<br>  If u want to cry, do it, i do all the time - I break down anywhere and everywhere, i cant help it, its just hormons.<br>  <br>  Everyone has there ups and downs every now and again but its normal to feel like crap when ur pregnant.<br>  <br>  When ur husband comes home from work - dont say anything to him, just ask him for a cuddle, there is a chance u will break down crying but he will understand.<br>  <br>  Good luck in ur pregnancy honey and trust me, everything will be fine.<br>  <br>  Love Manda xXx<br>  |`|AA10774554	I'm sure you'll be o.k.  You have a husband who loves you, you're expecting, and you obviously have friends that care about you enough to ask how you feel.  Everybody has their internal conflicts and emotional agonies but they rid of it by surrounding themselves with what's meaningful to them.  And remember it always helps to have somebody, anybody to talk to about your problems.  I wouldn't be surprised if you felt better by tomorrow, and if not tomorrow a few days.  Talk to people and find that solidarity to know your not alone in your doubtfulness and depression and you'll be perfectly fine.  Just call somebody so you don't have to be alone, or watch a favorite show, because taking your mind off of it is also important, to be carefree even for 30 minutes could relinquish a lot of anguish.  Good luck and smile.|`|II2GnkQtaa	honey we all get days (sometimes weeks) like this. Just try to apologize to everyone you yell at Im sure they all understand that you are not feeling quite your usual self at the moment. Sadly hormones can often cause behavior not normal for us so try to bear with it. The bigger you get the more pissed off you will feel so try to bear that in mind. I cope by having a damn good cry and wishing it was over lol
WAls73rvaa	Ah!! i love halloween for this purpose! im preggo too... <br>  <br>  (of course for all these you have to be showing or at least get a fake tummy)<br>  <br>  anywho...my best friend is preggo and she is going to be a nun, her friend (also preggo) is going to be a preggo playboy bunny...<br>  <br>  I am going to be a guy! (i got this idea when i saw a guy jogging *more like crawl/running* down the street who looked like he was about 9months along) Im going to wear some of my husbands pants a wifebeater, paint a beard on me and walk around with a (empty) beer can...oh and i found the funniest hat that says (beer belly on board) |`|5y2gY4Gbaa	It would be cute if you dressed up as baby! Maybe you could get your husband involved with your costume as well. You the baby and him the doting mommy maybe? That would be cute!<br>  <br>  Anything would be cute if you brought the baby aspect into it. I'm sure all your friends would love it! :] Congrats!|`|pULnfsmpaa	I am making my husband be prego with me and i am just going to dress up like a man!|`|xmVGViPiaa	I'm painting my belly to look like a jack-o-lantern.  |`|mTHeHxkmaa	lol my sister went at a pregnant nun when she was expecting its was cute as heck .. |`|AA11795652	When I was pregnant with my first, I dressed as a chubby little boy and my husband was Michael Jackson.  I know, that was wrong...  <br>  <br>  With my second, I did dress as a baby.  I wore flannel pjs I already had that had little rubber duckies on them and I did my hair in pig tails and put big pink rosy cheeks on my face and freckles.  It was easy, I was comfortable, and everyone loved it.|`|6mxSuVhhaa	I'm 32wks  preg to & my husband is going to be Bronco Mendenhall ( BYU Football coach ) My three boys are going to be BYU football players. SOOO that leaves me being a BYU Cheerleader!!!!! I know I'm soooo bad!
kzYHnrLSaa	lol|`|9MKY0IdIaa	hahhaha! nice|`|HIZ1G175aa	lol hmmmmmmm.........|`|aiJ4rL9vaa	well thats why we are having our baby! ;) |`|eXc8ohT1aa	umm whats that ?|`|c4915188681351ae48e3e8dbbb67e2baaa	For some reason, the phrase "routan boom" makes me think of a "root canal".|`|ZncV5gc0aa	We should all buy Caravans! <br>  
clmIFtP2aa	No it is not too early to test.  I got a positive when I was a week late.  If you really would like to know have bloodworks done.  Maybe you just ovulated late in this cycle.  But it is also possible to get a false negative.  Good Luck|`|Yf8E0wlsaa	Most likely correct, but I woudl test again in a week to make sure. you never know, the hormone levels could still be low.|`|abaad89210d63dec4904f2e85346439caa	no its not too early, but you do need to make sure you test the first urine of the morning when you wake up.|`|xmVGViPiaa	A test can always be a false negative.  You should wait a week, retest, and if you are still getting a negative result you should see your doctor... Some people cannot get positives on urine tests.
EN4ltMEWaa	Kegal exercises and more kegal exercises.  These will tone the muscles down there also making it easier for you when it comes to the pushing stage of labor.  You just squeeze ur muscles down there and hold it for ten seconds and keep repeatin, if ur unsure what muscles they are just stop urself while urinating and it's those muscles.|`|UvyC3fs3aa	cross your legs when you sneeze? wear a "light day" pad? talk to your doc and see if there's anything you can do to prevent this. i feel for you though. it happens to me too. i hardly ever sneeze though. it'd be really tough with allergies.|`|FtjtH0FEaa	Sad to say, not really.  It happened to me through-out my pregnancy.  I still have some trouble now.  K's are supposed to help.  Just wear light pads.  It's from all of the pressure from the baby on your bladder.|`|7X5YuURSaa	this happens to every pregnant women.<br>  don't be embarassed.<br>  just pick up some panty liners at the drugstore & you'll be fine!|`|3zcCgB3caa	It's normal. Evertime I sneezed or laughed I  had to pee.|`|XrhesTKvaa	it's normal|`|cnaWWmfVaa	Do your kegals...|`|CVdcrY3kaa	It's hard to control it all the time, get some thin pads and start wearing them to save your panties. Kegels are suppose to help those muscles, but when you've got a baby on your bladder sometimes nothing seems to work.|`|E0Lybd6Vaa	I had twins and when they are pressing on your bladder, there was often similar problems. The onlything you can do really is try one of those old lady bladder pads if you leak out a lot.<br>  <br>  It works|`|BzH9UFaLaa	Boy did you just bring back memories! My sister in law, a friend of hers, and I all took photos at a dance studio every year, and every year for 3 years one of us was pregnant. Every year one of us had a little "tinkle" problem from laughing so much! Okay, here's what you do...kegle (spelling wrong?) exercises and wear a pad. It's normal, I think every preggo goes through it, it does suck, but the kegle exercises should help. Good luck!|`|xmVGViPiaa	That's normal, you should wear a pad and change it several times a day (and never leave a wet pad on).  There's no way to stop it, it's just your baby pressing on your bladder.|`|HIRYscJlaa	I had this same thing and kegels didn't help- so  I invested in panty liners and just made sure I always had some in my purse and one on my panties and anytime I leaked abit I would just change it...|`|xdInBhLRaa	use pads, and work on your kegals, those helped me keep from leaking if ever while pregnant.
EpwTo0Xiaa	you could be pregnant or it could just be one of those late periods if it doesn't  come in a few days you should go to the  doctors|`|oWLD8ucJaa	well my period should be start torromow (every 24 days)... i had sex every days with my boyfriend with unprotected.. i might be pregnant too! so u r not pregnant cos u took pregnant test already|`|AA10186411	You could definitely be pregnant. |`|alv31wBlaa	sounds like a period to me girl .
ZVeGEdfUaa	They have a brand out called Yo-Mama (seriously), it contains things like dha that help give your baby a better start while in the womb. You can find it next to the other yogurts at the grocery store. l hope l was able to help!|`|xmVGViPiaa	Try to find yogurt without artificial sweeteners in it.  Other than that all yogurt is safe and probably very healthy to eat daily as it has calcium and vitamin D in it.  Just be careful of the sugar content, don't go too overboard.|`|kRQDm9Oiaa	Yogurt..yes. Eat pawpaw too.|`|LMc23g9Maa	Yogurts are very good for you, no matter what kind.|`|L8peUnIPaa	Any in moderation. Artificial sweeteners should be limited but so should real sugar containing products. <br>  OB/GYN RN & mom
jXG0m5zsaa	Because in some states it is again the law for a 20 or so guy to have sex with a 16 year old girl. Later in life a few year age difference or more isn't a big deal. You are talking about minors here. There is a huge difference in the maturity level, social skills, knowledge, etc  between a 16-17 year old girl and a 20 or 23 year old guy, |`|9y8Gd55haa	Well I got married at 17 to a guy that was 20.....we first started liking each other when I was 13, he was 16. we have been married for over 2 years and are as happy and in love as we were then. Don't listen to people that say stuff like that...just because you are young doesn't mean you are stupid :)   <br>   <br>  BTW..the age of consent in most states is 17, some states its 16.|`|c9387f79b14133134f45bd7ea7546614aa	You're forgetting one thing and that a 20 year old with a 16 year old is illegal (at least here in the US).  Unless the younger person wants her boyfriend to go to jail she should just say "NO" until she is 18.|`|FxJqovdzaa	my boyfriend is 20 and i am 17 we got together a month before my 17th birthday and he was 19. we will be together for a yr monday. we love eachother and to me that is all that matters and he is finally getting used to the fact we will be having a baby here in 4 months.|`|SslNP4qdaa	Not for nothing but, girls are more mature than guys are so naturally a girl would be atracted to a guy a few years older than her,,,,,but 16 is a little young to be with someone over 20...and not to mention against the law...|`|xmVGViPiaa	Guys in their 20s prey on teens because teen girls are easy to manipulate into thinking these guys are such wonderful guys.  Believe me, I know a few of them.  You may not be one of them perhaps your boyfriend is one of the few sweet ones (but keep an eye on him), but I know a guy who always dates girls in high school (and he's 23) because when they're working retail and making minimum wage, his job making $11 an hour sounds real good to them.  They start thinking he's making all these big bucks.  The fact that he is a lazy bum and stays with my boyfriend as a roomie mooching, with part time hours at work - seems just fine and dandy to the teenage girls as long as he is taking them out to dinner and buying them little cheap odds and ends.  No woman my age would put up with that crap - we want a man who will support a household (or help) and be a real adult... Whereas in most cases teen girls are not looking for that or do not understand that mindset yet (again I'm not saying all but a lot of them do feel that way - I'm sure you know plenty of girls in school who would date a guy just for "money" and petty gifts).|`|O0cteXxYaa	People are mean. Certain people do not think someone who is 16 or 17 has any clue about "real life." However, if these young people's parents allow them to date, then I see no problem with it. Don't let people being ugly get to you. No one has had a perfect life, no one is going to be the perfect parent, and no one is right 100% of the time. Best of luck to you and your boyfriend and the baby. :)|`|ZxpLfpx4aa	well only reason I can come up with is because its against the law and because people will be people... why is it bothering u so much... if ur life is wonderful WHO CARES what people think... YOU NEVER SHOULD CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK!!! People arent living your life for you, him or your child. You three need to go on and have a happy life... screw people!
6eaWRGaqaa	I agree with the person above. Some of those ideas seem not possible. Like an elevator would only be big enough for two people and what about low and high tide at the beach? I'm pretty sure everything will be washed away.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could dress us in Disney Character costumes and go to McDonald's, Burger King, or even a formal restaurant.<br>  <br>  -Catherine|`|mY26IlAaaa	Or Go to any beach |`|115BfzMFaa	ha ha. i doubt a few of them are actually socially acceptable ie. cinema and elevator ideas. but they sound fun. would the elevator be big enough even? <br>  why not all dress up as celebrities and go for lunch at mac donalds or pizza hut. see all the looks you will get then. |`|273e527afee76a6be1d3b1e5404fa9aaaa	Do you have time for all that???
AA11543189	it will take a month or two but yes you can I had the Mirena and it took me 7 months after removal to conceive|`|xmVGViPiaa	Yes.  You will ovulate before you get your period and you will probably not know you are ovulating.  Use a condom or get back on the depo if you are not wanting to get pregnant.|`|HIbkrTkJaa	with those shots u don't get ur period... my cusin took this shot and for 5-6 years she did not have her period once! she is now back on the pill and cant stop bleeding! I would advise u not to take those shoots and stick with the birth control pills... it's the same with the chip that they put inside u. i dont recomend u useing that either...|`|aDVoSo10aa	about birth control help u source|`|2QZWadQSaa	you were NEVER taking a contraception: you were taking an ABORTIFACIENT<br>  <br>  you could have been, and likely were briefly pregnant before: silent murder of fornication|`|qtiGDD6iaa	usually it will take a little while longer to fully wear off, keep an eye on it but i doubt that you will be preggy
9tNr1RMfaa	I'd say you are pregnant-- unless you have some hormonal problem. I have heard this is possible, but I think it is pretty rare. <br>  <br>  If you don't trust the brand, why not buy a test that is a different brand?? Thats what I did... I bought a 2 pack of equate tests and both were positive. Since they were generic I bought a 2 pack of Clearblue Digital to make sure. They were both positive too. I was shocked. lol.|`|05zXmWe8aa	You're definitly pregnant. Congrats sweetie. God bless =)|`|xmVGViPiaa	You are pregnant.  To get 2 false positives would be really really weird.
BChEQB1Xaa	Hi sweetheart, this sounds like a difficult situation, he obviouslt doesn't understand what it is like to be raped, maybe you need to sit with him and talk to him about it. you don't need to go into details, but try and let him know what you are going through. Sorry to say this, but he really doesnt sound like he's a very supportive person to be around. You need support and understanding and a shoulder to cry on. Like i said, try to talk with him, but if he gets stressed tell him you need some space, there's no point in carrying on with someone who doesnt understand or at least tries to understand. Make sure you also have the support of your family and/or doctor aswell. Good luck, and remember its YOU that matters, make sure you look after yourself.|`|uf6efp0Naa	Abusive and controlling men are clever, if someone has a chink in their armour they will spot it.  <br>  <br>  I know you love him, but don't let him have control all of the time.  Is counselling an option to talk through what happened to you last year as you aren't happy at the moment.  <br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|CT3QyHSQaa	hey honey<br>  i know how you feel<br>  but i'm sure you're boyfriend loves you,i think its irritating for anyone to see someone continusly crying<br>  please try to understand his feelings to,that is if u want this relationship to work<br>  if he is really violent with you then leave him,he does not deserve you|`|kAdgwDFqaa	Sounds like you need to just move on.  I'm sure that there is someone out there that will make you happy and is not abusive.  You deserve better.  GOod luck|`|GbGrS9YBaa	I'm Sorry to be honest, but clearly, he is no good for you.<br>  He doesn't understand, and seems like he never will!|`|5507858478baac68ed69511bef8b1860aa	why are you with him..?<br>  <br>  you sound like your attracting the wrong men, surely after a miscarriage and rape you would want time alone to be with yourself and build your confidence up and get over the emotional trauma you went through.<br>  <br>  you sound like a friend of mine who cant be with out a man and due to that always attracts the wrong men who only want one thing.<br>  <br>  my advice- dump this bloke, make a pack with yourself to stay single for a year, go to your doctor get some councelling for the rape/miscarriage, and start to build your confidence up. dont stand for men treating you like crap! you deserve better but you have to demand it first and then you will attract a decent bloke.|`|Yk7k23YSaa	Over the years I've learned how best to deal with these things.  It's funny that so many men, in trying to 'deal' with emotional women actually do too much.  It's really easy to over-estimate the amount of nurturing a woman needs when she's being emotional.  Having experimented with this phenomenon over time I've realized that the absolute best thing to do is just to hold you close and be tender.  It's also never a good thing to say things like '...stop crying' because issuing a command to stop crying isn't helping your partner to get through it and I'm sure you'll agree.  Emotions are illogical and messy and sometimes you just have to let them run their course without doing anything more complicated than hugging.  Hugs rock!<br>  <br>  I know it's not much, but it works for me without fail.  Who wouldn't like a hug from a big teddy bear?|`|c62a95c6696d81427b76aa335ba9d509aa	There is no real way to make someone understand the pain you feel if they have not gone through something similar! Also if he is hurting you physically or mentally you should really consider finding a better partner, you deserve much better then to be hurt by someone... It is not right of him to grab your chin very hard when he is trying to get you to look at him or stop crying, that is rude and is not going to help the situation. Honestly I think you can get much better and should dump him if he doesn't even attempt to understand why you are hurting. Good luck!|`|BlasLJUMaa	listen sweetheart<br>  you have been through a really bad time. so its your turn to have someone be nice to you. So please go to your doctors and explain what has happened. and he or she will put you in touch with the right people to talk to and care for  you, But first of all you need to dump the boyfriend.He is no good to you, i think you need so time on your own.<br>  Thinking of you, things will get better promise.you need a professional tho.your worth it.<br>  winnie x|`|273e527afee76a6be1d3b1e5404fa9aaaa	he is not a man!<br>  <br>  A man puts his woman before himself!<br>  <br>  dump him! whatever your problem might be he should understand and be logical not like some jack ***.<br>  <br>  He wants you only for fun time, and doesn't want to know about your problems, that is why is so aggressive, i'm a man myself and i know.|`|BEgoqBrGaa	Emily it sounds like you have a lot of stuff going on I really think you need some qualified help rather than  here where we dont know the full circumstances, good luck|`|8NCkVYXEaa	He sounds abusive. I'm sure thats not what you want to hear but you asked. Dump him and focus on yourself. |`|R8qr8fnfaa	i know some girls that had a miscarriage. i do not understand what you are you are going though , sorry no man will .  i can only give a dry shoulder to cry on . if he cant be there for you with out getting stressed JUST DON'T GO TO HIM FOR THIS . i am not saying to leave him . you should talk to your mom or your sister about this . just think that everything will be ok  , try not to think about it much . it is not good for to be like that .   if he is hurting you in this relationship maybe he is not good for you .<br>  please take care of yourself..|`|ijxTsW3Paa	You dont sound like your having a good time of it at the moment. Maybe you got with your now boyfriend too soon and you have not dealt with the hurt and pain from the last one. Maybe you should consider counselling to help you.  I wouldnt like the way your now boyfriend treats you and  i think you know what you need to do there you dont want to hear it but you might want to seperate from him for a while till you sort youself out  and then you might realise hes not boyfriend material. <br>  I hope you get sorted out and everything goes ok for you. Best of Luck.|`|0c330dc5c7e321c8e8dfd2f50ecea522aa	well that isn't the way to help you. He doens;t sound like realy greta guy hun. Tyr to write down your feelinsg in a journal and tak to frind if  you need tocry. Some tiem swe women just ned to cry. My hubby wheni cryhugs me and hold ms till I calm donw and tells me everything will work out and sometiems i just cry really hard so hard iget the hiccups I thin you need a new man but fr now try goingt o good frineds house she'll listen to you and probably undersatdna lot better.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Unfortunately at the end of the day a man never really CAN understand that sort of pain, and to be honest we can't blame them for that.<br>  My partner does the same thing when I'm really upset, gets stressed and often times will even shout at me to get me to calm down simply because he gets so upset that he doesn't know how to help me.<br>  This isn't frustration with me, it's frustration with himself. <br>  In saying that, physically grabbing your chin can be upsetting and triggering, and the last thing you need is to be reminded of that sort of thing. Perhaps sit down with him when you're completely calm and explain that when he does that, he's not only getting your attention, he's making the situation worse. He may simply not realise how it affects you.<br>  At the end of the day you can't change him or his behaviour, he has to change it himself. Explaining the situation may help... but he has to want to treat you better.|`|51Ib0kxVaa	Sadly I think somehow you have attracted yet another man who is wrong for you.  Probably you need to be on your own for a while in order to get help for the miscarriage and other stuff and find professional support.  Right now you do not have the capacity to cope and deal with him, and frankly he is not able to offer the right support for you. This is a very hard time and I am so sorry you have found yourself in this situation. But on balance, it may be best just to let him go.|`|oyoW6UJnaa	u sound like your a magnet for abusive men.................u need to look at why u let them behave the way they do|`|hUbETXKpaa	your getting yourself into a nasty trap, your ex raped you, your new boyfriend has done alot to hurt you!<br>  <br>  your only 15 and already your picking the wrong partners.....id suggest you move on in life and concentrate on YOURSELF...because at 15 ONLY YOU matters!.<br>  <br>  im 21 and have been with my partner for 7 years which is a Looong time for people of our age, we met in school and got serious pretty quick, i love him with all my heart but i do wish that id met him later on.<br>  <br>  we have a 2 year old daughter together she was unplanned and came as a massive shock, she changed our world and made us have to grow up in an instant.<br>  as much as we love her we have missed out on alot.<br>  <br>  What im trying to say is please don't throw your youth a way.<br>  <br>  you had a miscarriage, that was not your fault it happens to 1 in 4 pregnancies, you need to use that horrific experience to make you stronger, now is the time to get some guts and become an independant young women,  finish school and go to college and live happily in memory of your lost child.<br>  <br>  perhaps instead of depending on your new boyfriend speak to a councillor becausee it sounds like you are depressed and that's understandable.<br>  <br>  I know its easy for me to say because i don't know you but i would reccommend you run from this relationship FAST.<br>  <br>  Please make the right descision x|`|kfCVRyVjaa	Sweetie, it sounds like you are on a really bad roundabout of relationships here.  If this new man is in ANY WAY being abusive towards you, you need to get out of this relationship now.  This means anything verbal, physical or mental.<br>  <br>  I think you should get some counselling to deal with the rape and miscarriage.  Of ccourseyou're hurting over this.  You've been through a horrific experience.  Please go and see your doctor and get a referral to see a counsellor.<br>  <br>  You need some time on your own to work out your issues and I think that you should now try to turn to your family for assistance rather than this man.

xmVGViPiaa	When I first became pregnant I had cramps that were like mild period cramps for an entire week.  I did not have back pain but that does not mean that you won't or shouldn't, that may be a normal symptom for you.  It does sound like you may be pregnant, hopefully your results tomorrow turn out to be what you would like them to be :)|`|E0Lybd6Vaa	I had twins and never had early symptoms quite like this.<br>  <br>  Maybe it was just an illness or you strained yourself

Some people unfortunately have it the entire 9 months, I hope this isn't the case for you!  Good luck.|`|sHjuOVcgaa	I had morning sickness until 20 weeks.

Its weird but chewing gum helped me.<br>  Good Luck |`|u16njooqaa	it's good to take metoclopramide to help you lessen your feeling of nausea. ask your doctor about it. do you just feel nauseated or do you vomit too? how many times?  take vit B complex and eat food at frequent intervals but not heavy. avoid oily, spicy and fatty foods. avoid dairy. see your doctor coz if you are vomiting too several times then she might check your blood for any problems.  you might have to be admitted if it gets worst and you are losing your appetite and are not getting enough nutrition for the baby.

l6LUNx9yaa	Honey, you need to see a doctor. Most likely you've contracted either a bladder infection or a urinary tract infection (UTI). <br>  <br>  Bladder infections can be caused by a UTI that gets out of hand, by drinking in contaminated water (like lake water accidentally) or even by swimming in dirty water if your immune system is down. However, the later is less likely because while pregnant your immune system tends to strengthen.  <br>  <br>  A UTI can also be caused by contact to dirty water, but more likely than not, it is caused by additional pressure to your tract system. Even having sex can cause a UTI if there is too much friction.  A baby will put pressure on your bladder and tract system because your uteris is growing to hold your baby bun.  This pressure commonly causes UTI's in pregnant women.  <br>  <br>  Antibiotics may be needed to treat the UTI or bladder infection. The best thing for you to do also is to drink plenty of water and cranberry juice (you may even go 50% juice 50% water if it's too strong).  Make sure you're dubbling your intake of fluids. Instead of 8 glasses of 8 oz of water, you should be getting at least 16 glasses.  Not only will it flush out your system, but it will help your body keep hydrated and increase your blood flow to your baby. <br>  <br>  Also, make sure you're not holding it when you have to go to the bathroom.  Make many trips to the potty throughout the day.  It will relieve pressure on your bladder, and tract system, and will prevent you from getting future infections while you are pregnant.|`|jK9H6PHiaa	go to the doctor. my obgyn told me when your pregnant your more likley to get a uti or yeast infection than you would normally.|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	it sounds like you have contracted an infection so yes you should see your doctor.....  NEVER swim in a lake while pregnant!!!!!!!!!!!|`|xmVGViPiaa	You need to see your Dr right away (within the next day or two) -- you have a bladder infection, which can be dangerous during pregnancy.  It is best to stay out of that nasty lake until after your pregnancy is over.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	You might have a UTI or yeast infection.......or both.  I would call your OB, and inform him.  He probably can call in a perscription for something, or tell you something safe, to take over the counter!  Good Luck!|`|5Jn3Wkbeaa	Sounds like a UTI. Go see a doctor whenever you can and get some antibiotics. A lot of pregnant women get UTI's. They hurt, but it'll be ok.|`|mxCb5K5kaa	sounds like you ve got urself infected. go get urself checked up.it could vaginal infection which should be treated ASAP in pregnancy n be careful from next time|`|dzmFtzKHaa	Dont worry too much.  It sounds like a simple infection.  As the other said.  <br>  <br>  *Stay out of the nasty river.*|`|5d8be8c6129e8e057c6dea1e207df5e6aa	yep, dont take a chance when youre prego! :)
lck2hBSJaa	you will have an easy time losing the baby weight<br>  i like your description of how you look lol/.|`|DzHOggxsaa	I'm unsure what i look like.. lol this was funny though.<br>  I'm 18 weeks and i've gained 9 pounds so far (all in the belly)<br>  myspace.com/107063808 for my pic a little larger.|`|Hf9snNyzaa	People keep telling me that it looks like I gained it all in the tummy... but a few others have also said my butt has gotten big... I was pretty little when I got pregnant sooo I think I look cute... with clothes on that is lol|`|L42LJ1P4aa	Eh.. I wish I looked skinny. I definitely have a baby bump on my tummy and super huge breasts. Mind you, they were large enough. Now they're just ridiculously huge and making my back hurt so badly.|`|xmVGViPiaa	I'm pretty thin and my baby is low sitting.  I'm 29 weeks.  I guess I don't look like a toothpick though, I've noticed I've started getting a little bit chubby around my arms area - that doesn't make me happy :(|`|MtvwSBipaa	Similar, but a slightly fluffier toothpick.  <br>  <br>  For some reason my bum and boobs seem to me like they're fluffier than normal.  My pants fit alittle tighter in the rear and my bras are a lot tighter as well!  My fiance has no complaints about either of those things.. hahaha.. especially since pre-pregnancy I had like NO boobs.<br>  <br>  I weighed about 115 before I got pregnant and now weigh about 127.   I'm 22 weeks as well.  <br>  <br>  I'm curious, are you concerned about this or are you happy about it?  <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd be quite pleased that all I had gained was baby bump.<br>  <br>  I bet by the time you hit full-term you're going to look kindof amusing.  A friend of mine was like you, sticky stick and then this HUGE baby BUMP!!  I kept wondering if she was going to fall over.  It was rather cute. <br>  <br>  After birth her boobs got huge with milk (normally she had almost no boobs like me) and her belly stuck out for quite a while, about 3 1/2 months, because of the uterus needing to go back to its original size -- but after that she was back to sticky stick.   The good part though was that her boobs never went back to as small as they'd been.   I hope that happens to me! <br>  <br>  Some people gain a lot of weight -- water weight sometimes.. and others just unlucky slow metabolism.. <br>  <br>  We're lucky.  :)|`|ioZeveazaa	lol, I wish I was a toothpick with a marshmallow. I am almost 19 weeks and I weigh close to 140. I gained about 15 lbs
bdc33dbec2eaf9d225a2269e8e00f01baa	from personal experience you will be in their 3 days unless you have some complications and it can be longer. You will probably be swollen from all the IV fluids. You will be required to void before even contemplating going home. You will be in a lot of pain!!! and to top it off you will probably need all the help you can get with the baby. You will probably sleep as much as the baby so take advantage of the pain medications. Besides that good luck|`|5dRFku3Yaa	I had my son via c-section on Oct. 9, and you are right about the baby and visitors taking up most of your time. I got lucky because I was only in for two days. My oldest daughter stayed with my mom, and so it was just myself, my hubby and the baby plus visitors throughout the day and evening. But the last night my hubby made me send my son to the nursery so I could have one final night of uninterrupted sleep. Boy was it worth it!!! I would definitely recommend that you do that. Oh and as for the pain, it is almost unbearable, but Vicodin became my best friend. Also, the nurses will come in at all hours of the day and night to check your blood pressure and temp. That will be totally annoying. Other than that, all I can say is just to relax and take it easy because once you get home your all on your own. Congrats and Good luck!!|`|b2992f2a2ea3caa3f8cc3cb7eed730fdaa	Make or have someone make some meals to bring to you, nothing like home cooking, hospital food is not good. Maybe a ipod or CD player for the TV can get real boring. Bring your baby book I.E. Baby's first year and start reading up on the great things ahead. Addresses for your birth announcements and start getting them sent out. #1 REST and enjoy Your new girl. Good luck|`|gx4s68s8aa	I had my baby late Wednesday night and then I was discharged on Saturday and they wanted me to stay another day.  So you might be there longer than you think.<br>  <br>  Bring a good comfortable robe or two and easy to slip on slippers.  The nurses will want you out and walking the halls in short bits frequently.  This will help you prevent a blood clot. <br>  <br>  You might want to bring your baby book so you can fill it out while your baby is asleep.  But honestly I doubt you will feel up much else.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your baby girl.  Take care.|`|Ezkn5azdaa	usually you would be in there four to five days. I would suggest bring some books to read. But I would rest when the baby is sleeping. I would sleep. Right now you need rest and it would help you with the healing process. I heard you would need to walk around if you don't then they would keep you in there longer. They could offer you any pain medicine if you want it. |`|zQAWuMN4aa	I was in the hospital 5 days, 4 nights. Had the option of going home a day early but I said no.<br>  <br>  Puzzle books, books to read, portable games. A notebook to record stuff and a camera with lots of extra batteries. A list of phone numbers so you can talk to people. Although the first day you won't want to do anything. But it gets a little better day by day. The nurses where I was were EXCELLENT. There's 2 little kitchens in the whole post partum area where the patients can grab snacks & drinks if they want. I was able to put my daughter in her rolling bassinet thing and walk around the halls of the post partum section as much as I wanted. And I did. Slowly but I did because it was something else to do.<br>  <br>  CONGRATULATIONS and good luck!|`|J9Tbun7naa	The time flies... most of the time, you will be busy with the baby or visitors...and if not, you will probably want to rest. <br>  When I was awake and bubs was a asleep and I had no visitors, i played on my laptop. I had taken millions of photos of my daughter so spent alot of time uploading them to my computer (so I could take more lol).<br>  I also spent alot of time ringing/messaging people to let them know.<br>  <br>  Just take a good book if you like reading, a deck of cards..anything you want to do in your spare time<br>  <br>  Good luck and congralations|`|eI02IpWdaa	well you wont be able to move for the first couple of hours...u wont be able to get out of bed for the fist day either..the second day they want u to get out of bed and maybe even walk if your up to it. the pain wasn'tt that bad for me but i guessevery oness diff...the give u pain meds if ur feeling pain... im not sure if everyone was like this but the first day u pee in a bag (forgot what its called)...also i was on a diet..i cudnt eat solid foods or have juice.. only jello and chicken broth for the first 2- days...till i made a bowel movement....good luck|`|K9kN68fwaa	I was there for 5 days but it can vary, The first day I was out of it and wanted to sleep but the stupid nurses come in and check on you every 15 minutes!!! And thank god that only is for the first day. So pretty much most of your day you are spending time talking to doctors and nurses and rating your pain level on a scale of 1-10. Also make sure that you ask a nurse when the soonest you can stand up and walk around. The sooner the better. I took care of my baby the whole time I was in there and I am here to say let the nursary watch her. You need as much rest as you can get. Plus they can get your baby anytime you want. Enjoy that luxury while you can. the second day you look forward to all of your meals. I know I did. You'll probably spend most of your second day calling everyone to visit, if they haven't done so already. The third day is usually picture day for your baby. And this is where the first cute outfit that you have purchased your little one comes into play. Make sure to purchase a newborn outfit. For some reason none of my mommy friends informed me of the newborn size and my daughter was wearing 0-3 month clothes and her outfits swallowed her whole. Not to mention her hat ended up looking like a chefs at since it was also too big and I insisted on having her hat on in her pictures so they tied a rubber band on it. The fourth day you are more than likely going to get more visits from your doctor and they will want to know what pediatric center you would like to choose for your child.

veWLulnfaa	You shouldn't wake a sleeping baby. When your son is hungry he'll let you know. He's probably only taking a few onzes at night because he's more interested in sleeping and doesn't need the extra milk.<br>   I was given the wrong advice by a midwife at the hospital and was told a baby must never go 6 hours without feeding but as soon as I stopped waking my baby for feeds if I felt she was sleeping too long she sleep right through the night, for 12 hours, and its been the same since. Do what you feel is right though.|`|mCF4wGjdaa	Hi wife and mama,<br>  just like you, your babies will only ask for food when they're hungry - and they will let you know that they're hungry!!!!<br>  Force feeding when you think they ought to drink can damage their digestive systems. <br>  <br>  So, worry less and enjoy more - you don't need to do anything to make your baby feed - it just happens naturally.<br>  <br>  What does disturb me a little, is this oz etc. How on Earth can you measure what is coming out of your breast? <br>  <br>  Blessed be.<br>  <br>  Karma Singh|`|k29RA4XMaa	If he's having wet diapers at least 6 times a day, doesn't seem lethargic, his soft spot isn't 'sunken' in and is gaining weight, then let him be.  <br>  <br>  If you seem to be really worried about it...call the pediatrician just for reassurance.|`|FfqzM9uyaa	he's a good weight. babies are designed to eat when hungry, so he will wake and cry when he needs to be fed. I'd leave him alone and let him tell you. i'm a firm believer in following your baby's lead. they are good at screaming at you when they need something!|`|AA10106791	I think  if he has about 5 to 6 wet diapers then you should leave him alone. But he doesn't have that much wet diapers, then you should wake him up about 2 to 3 hours. I mean my doctor told me a baby should eat through the night about 2-3 hours when they are breastfeeding.  So if he haven't enough wet diapers then his weight is probably bigger then it suppose to be which is a good thing anyways.|`|AA10946089	I wouldn't wake him. My dr. did tell me to not let my daughter go more than 4 hours without eating, but at night, I think that's a little different. If we want them to sleep at night eventually, why would we introduce feedings? As long as he is healthy, which it sounds like he is, I wouldn't wake him - let him cue you in to when he is hungry!|`|a8IBqr5Jaa	it seems af if you r concerned to your baby's hunger.dont force feed him.babies have their own wake- sleep patterns, hunger patterns etc.if they are hungry they with just 1 expression of crying will inform you. you the mother you will know his patterns.pls dont force feed him.he himself will alarm you of his hunger.|`|F7HBPnD8aa	i would feed on demand its not like hes under weight he will wake when hes hungry he might start taking more formula each feed and going longer between feeds|`|3h8aqxdZaa	Dont wake a sleeping baby to feed unless like your daugher they have special needs.|`|U3jS5k9eaa	I would not wake a baby to feed them (unless premature or docs orders). If he is hungry he will wake and scream and you wont be able to get the bottle ready quick enough. Happy sleeping :)|`|AA11775891	I think if you're concerned, wake him up every 4-5 hours, (if he doesn't wake up on his own before then!)  I think I've read that  a newborn baby shouldn't go all night without eating.<br>  <br>  Enjoy this time with your kids! It'll never come again! :-)
okh3hL8taa	The FEDERAL age for working any job without a work permit is 16.  In order to get a work permit one must be working for the city/county they live in and have their parents fill out a form that asks questions about the family income.  If the family income is too high the child will not be given a work permit.  Work permits are basically granted to kids from families that are below the poverty level.  <br>  There are many things a 14 year old can do however, Babysitting is only one, there is yard work, helping elderly neighbors around their homes, dog walking, taking care of pets for neighbors who work all day. Door to door carwshes or door to door Dog washes.  One just has to use their imagination.|`|xmVGViPiaa	I'm not sure what Arz is, but I live in AZ and I know the age to start officially working is 16 years old.  Maybe your daughter can do baby sitting for neighbors or friends if she is good with children?  Or help do odd jobs for friends/family/neighbors?    Make sure it is for someone you trust, though.|`|CGYFq4qPaa	babysitting and household chores.  16 ???|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	If you mean Arizona, it's pretty much 16.  There are a few jobs available for 15 year olds, but not many.<br>  <br>  Has she thought about some volunteer work instead?  The Humane Society or an animal rescue organization?  Just a thought.

HnqRAqtTaa	Mine didn't.|`|AA12041870	I did, and they had to have a job to pay their own insurance. |`|F7tyzrMzaa	I'm a 14 yr old sophomore and skipping grades so my dad's pretty impressed already. Besides that, he said that if I want a valid license then I can't get anything lower than a C in any classes until I graduate. If I get one C then I have to make up for it with three A's in a row. <br>  At the moment I'm on a 4.0 GPA so it really doesn't bother me. I seem to be on the right track. I did argue with him that having a high GPA doesn't necessarily mean you're a good driver.<br>  He said that's not the reason he was keeping an eye on it, it was because having a drivers license is a privilege up until I'm 18, so he wants to make sure I've earned it.<br>  I'm already learning to drive though, because we live on Wright-Patterson AFB so there's plenty of room for him to teach me.<br>  Besides the grades, he just wants to make sure I won't end up killing myself or anyone else when driving. If you have a child trying to get their license, good luck!|`|jSzaiuzdaa	4-0 fool!<br>  <br>  <(^^,)>basscreator|`|LolctYwBaa	Yes!|`|ujodkfVgaa	Yes. 2.76 (I think, I believe that's making honor roll).|`|AA11469947	No i didnt tell mine that...they did good in school anyway ad kept a high GPA...so when they were 16 they both got their drivers license and a car...I think you want to make sure your grades are good MOSLTLY for yourself and second so that if you want things ur parent cant use that against you...liek saying ur not doing good in school...keep ur grades up anyway do that for yourself not becasue u want a reward...|`|R3VtphWuaa	i am a younger teenager and my parents required me to hold a 3.3 gpa because that's what was expected of me at the least. what you want to do is take a look at their grades and see what their gpa is, and add .1. thats what my parents did to my brother|`|AA10091485	not necessarily a gpa<br>  but required to maintain good grades/ a/b range<br>  and try my best at everything<br>  and be a responsible well rounded person that they raised me to be |`|o13oejiuaa	No, a license has nothing to do with their GPA, a license is necessary.|`|d8023b2fabb3330b02673c650f1b5c8baa	Having a license requires maturity.  If you child is mature enough to make the right decisions, then yes.  If your teen doesn't make good choices then they can wait|`|ms5vSkVlaa	I'm just 14, but I think that parents should make sure their kids are safe drivers, which doesn't necessarily mean they have a high GPA. |`|dDPFWyPjaa	I just had to have all my classes passed with at least Cs
OxFV92hJaa	It means your getting close hun! Could be "back labor", or it could just be your body getting ready. Either way, your almost there. G'luck on a quick easy labor/delivery! Hope it goes as you wish. Congrats in advance!|`|3fk6bTMxaa	Most likely your baby is dropping into position. Use warm baths to help your body adjust to the new position. Best, G<br>  <br>  As you become closer to the birth you may lose some or all of your mucous plug, you will have more discharge, your water may leak or gush, you may feel your baby’s head drop lower in your pelvis giving you more room to breath. As your baby drops you will also feel the pressure to urinate more frequently and may feel a dull backache as your body adjusts to the new positioning of your baby. You will begin to feel impatient and excited about your baby’s impending arrival. You will also feel ready to have the baby right now. This is part of nesting to help you look forward to labor and to get you moving and active. None of these signs mean that your labor has actually started, just that your body is preparing for birth, which takes weeks to prepare for. Keep in close contact with your health team during this period. Always telephone your doctor or midwife if you have any health changes during pregnancy or any questions or concerns about your pregnancy. <br>  <br>  True labor pains are constant and rhythmic, even during early labor, occurring every fifteen to twenty minutes. After a few hours, the contractions occur about every five minutes. False labor occurs when the painful contractions diminish in intensity after a few hours and labor does not progress. The best way to tell the difference between true and false labor is to drink two glasses of water and sit down or lay down on your left side to rest for a bit. The contractions will subside if this is false labor or the beginning of premature birth.|`|8IPLqfzLaa	It may mean nothing other then the baby dropped and you are uncomfortable. I have been having the same problem and getting up alot more to pee. I have always said that I get more sleep after the baby comes then in my last month! You tend to get so uncomfortable that nothing really helps.|`|AA11102589	Possibly preterm labor. They say usually your baby will come two weeks early or two weeks late. Try timing your contractions.|`|AA10949064	It could be that the baby is dropping and you are feeling more weight on your abdominal and back muscles.
ly59dQ3gaa	I went through the same thing.  I lived off of peanut butter and toast for the whole first trimester and the last month of my pregnancy.  On days that I was feeling 'ok' I ate my regular peanut butter and toast along with Campbell's tomato soup.  <br>  <br>  To make myself think I was eating somewhat healthy, I bought only organic peanut butter and Ezekiel bread.  <br>  <br>  Try it!|`|xmVGViPiaa	For some people that happens and can be normal for this pregnancy.  I do think you should mention it to your dr though when you see him/her next.  Just eat what you can manage to keep down and make sure you are getting enough fluids.  Hopefully you will start feeling better soon - it is almost over with!|`|4ba98b8af74d061dc95b4b1fb03b2ff7aa	That must stink... but at least push fluids and whatever your body is accepting.... at least you can eat yogurt and applesauce and drink milk....  Good luck. Congratulations on the baby... It will be worth it when you hold him/her....having kids is about alot of sacrifices  guess you are learning this early on lol...

Same with Ruby. I also like the name Kaitlin but it is a pretty commonly used name. Same with Isabel.<br>  <br>  The name Charlotte isn't too bad either. I don't really like Summer as a name. <br>  <br>  My mom used to have a cat named Ebony so I would never use that name.<br>  <br>  I don't like any of the other names. Indianna wouldn't be too bad but it reminds me too much of the state. I would never use the name Clover. I guess Amethyst is cute but I wouldn't use it.<br>  <br>  For the boys....<br>  I only like Conner, Nicholas (mostly as a middle name) and Isaac (also mostly as a middle name). <br>  <br>  I know Rory is a boys name but it reminds me of a girl because of the show Gilmore Girls.

I went to the ER yesterday (at 10 weeks 1 day) to be sure nothing was wrong... cause I didn't feel 'right'. I just told them I was having really bad cramps and they did a full check up and ultra sound to make sure it wasn't ectopic.

Ultrasounds have become "stronger" over the years.  Certainly they have a very valid place in pre-natal care, but we don't need developing cells being subjected to scans more than is absolutely necessary.<br>  <br>  I am sorry I don't have the reference to the article, but I'm sure you will find reference material on the web.<br>  <br>  Why would you be worried?

KlJHZRSiaa	It's possible to conceive with low progesterone, but sustaining the pregnancy will be the issue. Your baby needs progesterone to maintain itself while the placenta is being developed. Then in the second trimester the placenta makes its own hormones.<br>  <br>  However, progesterone will not do you andy good if you're not ovulating, so that's the biggest issue you need to attend to first. Then deal with the progesterone question later because once you're ovulating properly, the progesterone issue might actually solve itself!  Luckily, there are several things that your doctor could do for ovulating, including a prescription for Clomid which can help a lot.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately there's not much you can do on your own in advance of seeing the doctor for some basic tests, but ensure you're taking a balanced multi-vitamin each morning. I'd also suggest a daily 100mcg of vitamin B6 which is good for regulating hormones naturally. Best of luck!|`|NUhvtbYCaa	I actually have the same issue.  I got pregnant twice last year, but unfortunately both pregnancies ended in m/c.  After the second m/c my doctor ran many tests, they all concluded that my progesterone levels were low.  I'm currently taking progesterone supplements (suppositories) and have yet to get pregnant again.  I also started on Clomid this month with Estrodial (estrogen)...now I'm in the TWW.  According to my Dr. I shouldn't have a problem carrying to full term.  If for some reason this doesn't work for me after 6 months he will refer me to a fertility specialist.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  I wish you the very best.  Keep us posted!|`|9e0QfljBaa	the dr can give you something to bring up your levels my sister was the same way she started taking it and was pg within the month

DS21ekeJaa	I'm 46 and would shoot myself if I got pregnant now! There is more to motherhood than being able to deliver a baby and the raising of this child should be the primary concern. If you deliver at 60 and are 76 when you are teaching this child to drive- don't you think you're reactions will be affected? Or at 78 when they graduate high school?  Don't you want to be healthy and vital when they get married instead of worrying about whether Alzheimer's will be your new best friend? 50% of adults over 85 have Alzheimer's Disease. You will not remember your child, much less your grandchildren. |`|xmVGViPiaa	I wouldn't agree with a 50 or 60 yr old woman having a baby... She is getting older and in many cases may not be able to run after a toddler and take care of a baby as efficiently as a younger woman.

This may be why you are sweating a lot more while working than you usually do.  <br>  <br>  You should discuss your lifting with your doctor.  Try not to pick up loads heavier than 20 lbs, and take more trips if you have to with lighter loads.  Use your legs when lifting, and if you don't feel comfortable lifting something you should seek help from a coworker.  If you can use a dolly with wheels that will also help keep a lot of strain off of your back and muscles.  Drink a lot of water since you are sweating and if you begin to feel tired then you need to sit down and take a break.

On top of that I started to have a big distaste for any kind of meat.  I was afraid I wasn't taking in enough protein (even though I know the baby does not require much that early during the pregnancy) but not eating protein is not good for me either.  So I told my doctor and she recommended drinking Ensure high protein.  I usually drink it in the morning and it helps provide me with a bit of energy and stops my nausea for at least for 2-3 hours.  You can ask your doctor about it.  I think the downfall of drinking this stuff is that you can pack on weight fast so I stick to only one a day.|`|xmVGViPiaa	That's completely normal hun.  Just try to eat, I know it can be hard.  Eat ANYTHING you think sounds faintly good.  I could eat a lot of watermelon and other fruits that were light and watery and they would stay down - along with toast and nuts, things light like that.  Try to stay away from foods with a strong smell they will make you sick.  It'll go away soon, you just have to force food down for a while - it makes eating the most dreaded activity of the day (then going to work doesn't seem so bad!).|`|9y8Gd55haa	Oh its normal!!

I do not have an appetite. <br>  The thought of me eating chicken or steak or my normal foods make me sick. The doc tells you to eat 6 small meals a day... what do you eat with an appetite like this? So, I found something I can eat... and I have been eating cereal for about 6 weeks now. The smell of anything makes me sick... the worst part, Im in my second trimester and its supposed to be over by now. I am sorry you lost your appetite, but its nice to know I am not nuts. lol<br>  Eat toast, things that dont smell, completely bland. Plain potato chips... and definitely ginger snaps for that morning sickness. <br>  Good luck, I hope the app comes back soon for you and I both!

xmVGViPiaa	A few years back I went nearly a year without having a period, my Dr kept saying my hormones were normal but my period just wouldn't come.  Finally, it came - and my periods have always been regular besides that freaky instance....<br>  <br>  Though the pregnancy chance is there for you - hopefully they do a blood test on you and you get the results you are hoping for.  Your symptoms sound kind of like they could be pregnancy symptoms but often times pregnancy symptoms can be symptoms of many other things as well.  :(|`|QnVWA8ycaa	i cant even tell u only the doctor can...it basicly sound like stress annd if u were in a hot bath then of course it make u want to poo.. it relaxes muscles.... but check with the doctor|`|0MMOaHTfaa	obviously something is going on.  If they did a blood test after missing 2 periods it would have shown up if you were pregnant by then.<br>  Have you taken a home preg test?  Do you even think you could be preg?<br>  <br>  If you are younger I know sometimes your periods can be off especially if you aren't on the pill because that tends to regulate it.  Also, women with eating disorders will stop getting their periods or very athletic women.<br>  <br>  I 'm not saying any of those apply to you just giving some suggestions to think about.<br>  <br>  Try taking a HPT.  if it's negative you can probably rule that out and will have to work with your doctors to figure it out.<br>  <br>  good luck
Fy9S6hjIaa	I had gestational hypertension and was on bed rest for the last 5 months of my pregnancy.  Begining at about 35 weeks I started having a little protien in my urine and having frequent headaches.  I ended up being induced at 39 weeks with preeclampsia.  So just watch out, take it easy, and try to eat healthy and drink lots of water.  <br>  <br>  I know it's pretty scarry, so good luck and try not to stress too much.<br>  <br>  (Another cause for protien in the urine is a UTI)|`|A7025pm1aa	You need to call your doctor and talk to him about that. I had a friend lose her daughter due to protein in her urine. Please call your doctor and find out whats going on. Please let me know what the doc says.|`|AA10149994	This is a question for your doctor to answer.. ask what is going on why he is not concerned and what it means for you? after all you should trust the doctor in charge of you and your babies health.  you have all the rights to know what is going on. remember your are paying for his services makes sure you are getting every thing you deserve. 
AA10151959	When I was young and in college I mapped out my whole week and found I had 57 hours of time that was not delegated to school, sleeping, eating, etc. But I never got anything done.

LOL It's not really a graph but my calender.  I have three boys and 5 sports and a wonderful husband who is a firefighter/paramedic.

We had a relaxed and enjoyable weekend.  That's what a weekend's for - why graph it out and get technical about it.

Then about 8 days before my period was due I started getting nausea, especially after eating, and I felt I couldn't eat as much.

VgSVSwhVaa	According to HIPAA Laws, doctors are not allowed to run any test without prior consent of the patient or the patient's power of attorney. If they were going to test for pregnancy, they must ask you first, or you could sue their pants off. |`|cw42LOLBaa	No... they only test for what they say they are testing for.  If you want them to test for pregnancy they can.|`|ZMFeQG7yaa	In some cases, doctors will do pregnancy tests when you go in for any issues that result in needing a urine sample. If you want to also have a pregnancy test done the best thing to do is to mention it to the doctor.|`|fPX1lD8uaa	They may.  You should have asked your doctor if they test for pregnancy... I'm sure they would have told you. 
OvTznP6Eaa	I got one with my last pregnancy right around the time I found out I was pregnant. I'd never had one before.|`|LJvWipKMaa	When you are pregnant, you have an increased risk of developing a urinary tract infection and as you know sore breasts are a symptom of pregnancy.  i think a trip to the doctors is needed because if you are pregnant then your water infection will need to be treated early on. good luck x|`|GjuRYsITaa	it mat be a coincidence. my last two pregnancy's before i found at i was at docs with urine infection, so maybe you are do a test|`|WXSvozQ8aa	Doctor maybe? a pregnancy test????
ddfa35f688c4a1a8449b269c785e8793aa	1 in 3 women experience some bleeding during early pregnancy, often the cause is not known and in most cases the pregnancy continues with no effect on the growth and development of the baby. It could, however just be your period! I'm surprised the doctor didnt do a pregnanct test to be honest. Why dont you a try a home pregnancy test? All the best.|`|N46yWUxJaa	listen to the docter|`|8tT1kv6Qaa	hi, its highly unlikely that you are pregnant but only a pregnancy test can tell you that, did you know that women during a period only actually loose an egg cups worth of blood the rest is the lining of the womb, i loose the brown stuff for a about 2 days then it turns red, everybody is different so no one person can tell you whether is right or wrong, you say your trying for a baby, you need to be patient if its going to happen it will, the more you get worked up about it the less likely it will..<br>  <br>  good luck i hope it happens soon for you!!|`|AA10995552	well sometimes periods are weird|`|JohaTA7uaa	If you are bleeding at all whether brown or red, you are probably not pregnant. The brown is normally at the start or the end and is normally old blood. You can have an implantation bleed which can happen just before your period, but not many people experience this. I guess just wait another week and see what happens.
13863a5ef0163f33e54809320ce35862aa	I was on loestrin 24, and it barely stopped my bleeding. I missed one pill and took it 8 hours later when i woke up, and i had already started bleeding again. i got put on ortho-tricyclen which is stronger than that and it worked just fine.

KTdTXqNJaa	All babies have them! The small, circular, soft spot on top of your newborns head, which is actually called the fontanel. What you may not know is that there are actually two fontanels on your newborn. The anterior fontanel is on top and the posterior fontanel is at the back of the head. <br>  <br>  Soft spots are placed where the skull has not completely closed at birth. The anterior fontanel is about two inches wide and may not be closed completely until your baby is 18 months old. The posterior fontanel is only about a half inch wide and will be closed by the time your baby is three months old, much earlier than the anterior soft spot.|`|3v3HnW2laa	as they get older it gets smaller and smaller|`|MZNfj9Eoaa	yes, as they get older it will become hard because the cartlige will be replaced with bone.

21ad3baf31c3926f8f6f1bf7f94a9d54aa	I would pay minimum wage per hour. Babysitting is a hard job when it's not your own child. And you want to treat the person caring for you baby with respect. Why anyone would pay less than what companies pay is beyond me. I started babysitting when I was 12. I earned 40 dollars a day for working 7 hours. And that was working for a family member. I would have expected more from anyone else. You shouldn't pay as much a a daycare, but don't rip the sitter off. It's your choice, but remember...  you get what you pay for. If I ever hire a sitter for my baby, I would pay at LEAST minimum wage, if not more.|`|Cu8svhwAaa	I don't charge any specific amount for ages, just a flat rate of 2 dollars an hour per child.

lfvXmv0oaa	It depends on who the person is and if the baby is sleeping when you leave. I babysit for a couple, but there daughter is already in bed when  I get there. I just check on her ocassionally and get paid $5/hr while doing it. If the baby is a wake I charge more like 7 or 8/ hr. I get family members to babysit my own kids for free, I also trade sitting with my bf. It works great.|`|bWvqj955aa	We pay our babysitter $8.00/hour but I think $6.50 or $7.00 would probably be fair, especially if it is a teenager. <br>  <br>  I know about the budget.  It kills me to pay someone $50 everytime my hubby and I want to go out for the evening.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FdpIt4Hbaa	I think it's good but on the weekends you may wanna go up to 6.50 come on it's the weekend and they do stuff so if they can give it up to babysit then i think that's cool|`|pdVaE3Gfaa	depends how many hours.  5 hours = 25 so if the babysitter works 5 days it will be 125 a week. Its not that bad|`|tRsph0cCaa	I would ask around to see if friends or a family member would watch your baby because they will charge less. I do think it depends on the level of difficulty of watching your child, if he/she is sleeping through the night and eating on a good schedule and is a relaxed baby I would say that 5 dollars is good, also any high schooler would be thrilled to make some money but make sure you know the person well becuase I would never trust my babys safety with someone I do not know well. Also explain to the babysitter that you are on a tight budget and maybe tell her you would take her to a movie or dinner one  night as a thank you.
UPHTowRYaa	Yes, it's pretty normal...your uterus is shrinking and trying to firm up after the birth.  But, if it continues for another day or two, or if the sensation changes drastically, call your OB.|`|bWvqj955aa	Girl, I was sore for 3 weeks! <br>  <br>  If you develop a fever, you definitely need to go see a doctor immediately, as it could be a sign of an infection.  <br>  <br>  One question I would ask is if you are nursing.  If so, you will have some minor cramping/tenderness for awhile after delivery.  Your uterus starts out the size of a pear and stretches almost unbelieveably.  It has to "contract" to get back to normal.  Nursing stimulates that contracting big time. I had contracting for about a month after delivery.<br>  <br>  Everyone's experience is different -  if you really feel like something is not right, go with your gut instinct - it never hurts to get checked out! <br>  <br>  Good luck with your recovery.|`|A3ETTA0taa	First--congratulations!  Second, I think it is normal shrinking of the uterus and/or repositioning of the colon.  The colon actually sits up on top of the baby in utero, and has to migrate back to normal position, along with everything else that got squished along the way.  I wouldn't be too concerned unless it is excruciating.  Try lying on your stomach if it is gas.<br>  <br>  P.S. I assume you did not have a C-section.|`|c56d3e81605e0594bdbef8c5e2e5d37baa	Totally normal...it is like your abs just went through the workout from H*LL and your OBGYN was the drill Sergeant! Just give it time. Even after a really good workout you are sore for a while and you were only working for an hour or so. If you are still sore in a week, then you might want to call the doctor.|`|f2sJQGTWaa	yes, it is normal.  Its from the muscles contracting.  Everything was stretched quite a bit and it takes your body some time to adjust.  You should be fine unless you begin to run a fever, have foul smelling discharge, or the pain becomes intense.  In that case I would go to see you OBGYN or at least call because in this case you could have an infection.  Moderate tenderness alone is not a sign to be concerned,|`|ziyfB20Iaa	yip its probly your belly going through a bit of a recovery stage... if it is really painful or carries on for too long then contact your doc.  it may be that you have just strained your already weak muscles with lifting baby and your other child... i know i hampered my recovery by being super mum one day and lifting too much stuff and the next few days i was in agony!!  try and take it easy (if possible with 2 kids!!)
KtocQ22Aaa	Remeber not everybody is perfect and everyone does things that they will regret for years to come.  The withdrawl method (pulling out early)  is ineffective 85% of the time.  So, there is an 85% chance that you could be pregnant.  You need to take a pregnancy test and you need to ask your boyfriend if he has had sex before.  If he hasn't then you most likely wont have an STD.  From now on remain abstinant because that is 100% effective in preventing pregnancies and STDs.  You also need to talk to your boyfriend and your parents.  Your parents might be mad but they will come around.  Also, please DO NOT choose abortion.  There are so many families who are unable to get pregnant and you can help them by giving your baby up for adoption.  Your life is not ruined.  Having a baby is a miracle unfortuanately, you may have to have that miracle before you are ready.  I hope everything works out and remember everyone makes mistakes.  Good luck: )|`|jdRKZe18aa	Little late for regrets I'd say huh?<br>  The word stupid, thoughtless, too young & immature to be having sex if you can't be responsible enough to say NO... you can't take BACK being pregnant but there will always be another chance to DO IT with him so tell him if he can't WAIT then you aren't interested!  <br>  <br>  Start carrying your own condoms, decide WHAT PART OF NO don't you understand to tell him next time....  You also can't take back an STD, HIV or a regret THIS BIG.... I think you oughta rethink the idea of you even having sex right now don't you?   <br>  <br>  They have a morning after pill at Free CLinics or Planned Parenthood but it might be too late for that now too...<br>  <br>  Haven't you seen those commercials on TV lately.....<br>  Stop - PAUSE - rethink before it's too late???? <br>  Come on girl - be smart - HE can't control his D**K so YOU need to control yourself for both your sakes!|`|en7wgVfyaa	Your parents have an idiot for their daughter. Go ahead and screw up your life. You are just another statistic.|`|8d9SvoJiaa	get your self cheked out at the clinic or doctors for any sti's then wait untill you miss your first period after having sex (4 weeks) then take a pregancy test or you could just go to the doctors to do a home test after  about 2 weeks after having sex and they will tell you sooner <br>  if you are pregant you have 3 options <br>  .give the baby up after giving birth<br>  .get an abortion<br>  .keep the baby<br>  once you found out whether you are tell your boy friend <br>  then tell your parents <br>  if your not my advice would be to go on the pill so you have no chance of getting pregant untill you want to <br>  good luck oxoxo|`|oT7rqBItaa	That was really stupid next time insist that he uses a candom and don't allow anyone to force you to do that.You can store your own as well just be more responsible.I don't know what you can do I guess you can do a blood test to see what you have not contracted or contracted|`|okh3hL8taa	This is what happens when children start dating long before they are mature enough to do so.  You shouldn't even be dating let alone have a boyfriend.|`|AjJZQJ1Qaa	stupid! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?! just take a pregnancy test. if ur pregnant- your life is pratcially going... going... GONE!|`|5yDN37Qhaa	Saying "he cant control his dick"<br>  or calling you "stupid and immature" is so not appropraite.<br>  <br>  Ok, WE ALL have had unprotected sex sometime in our lives.<br>  Just take a breath, and make a plan.<br>  You're afraid your pregnant? Ok, if you miss a period take a test.<br>  Afraid of STIs? Visit a healthdept for screening.<br>  <br>  If you are pregnant? Your life is FAR from over. There are all sorts of options...<br>  If you have a STI? Luckily, some can be treated.|`|3yL1CcwXaa	First off don't have sex if you don't have a condom ever!  Next hopefully you don't miss your period and come out pregant due to pre-ejaculation, wait for your period to come if not go to the doctor. <br>  Good Luck to you and please make positive choices.|`|2gwizWoSaa	Go to your local planned parenthood.  Bring a couple girlfriends for support.  Everything should be free, due to the fact that you are under 18.  They will test you for whatever you want and even give you free birth control.<br>  <br>  Dont hold on to regrets, learn from the situations :D|`|4Vtrbu89aa	First off the "pull out" method is not safe because you can get pregnant from the pre ***. Also, you should go to a doctor and get a pregnancy test and std tests done! use a condom!|`|34ZcgJ80aa	jaja that happened 2 me and look i have a big belly now ..yeah i might feel good  4 them but u see it leaves us pregnant buy a test!!! good luck|`|Ah4Jbg3Paa	Go to planned parenthood to get tested for pregnancy and STDs. NEVER do that again.|`|N7TYbaoXaa	go to the doctor and get an HTP you are stupid<br>  waut until you are married do not ruin your life<br>  Tell your parents that you were stupid and you need there help|`|d0t4VGJHaa	its funny that kids try this cos the precum is actually the part with the sperm in it i doubt ur pregnant tho|`|r58tQP0Paa	as it says in the bible ABORT your regrets|`|aYM4BBFPaa	umm do what track lover says. and pleez if u r pregnant dont get an abortion!!!!!!!!!(o and REALLY, DO NOT DO IT AGAIN)|`|AA11072566	G2 THA D0CT0R AND HAVE A TEST DONE.....AND NEST TIME DONT BE STUPID , THINK BEFORE U DO SOMETHING!...
8d9SvoJiaa	its very possible that you could <br>  go to the doctors and get a home test to see<br>  or wait one more month and do a pregancy test|`|s3KI0sh9aa	Yes you could be but why don't you seek advice?  Go to the chemist and buy a pregnancy test or go to your GP.  Sore boobs doesn't always mean that you are pregnant neither does being bloated.  Seek advise and next time if you don't want another baby use protection!|`|u6tW9Wejaa	take a pregnancy test?|`|zD2NWrIzaa	unprotected sex equals big risk of pregnancy|`|xmVGViPiaa	You could be pregnant.  You should wait until your period is due and then take a HPT.
7Df7ULt2aa	that was the baby...and the twiching sounds like muscel spasums|`|xmVGViPiaa	Twitching in your abdomen could be your baby moving, depending on how far along you are.<br>  <br>  Twitching in your muscles could be a sign that you are not getting enough B vitamins.|`|758cDKEFaa	it sounds normal.<br>  but ring your hospitals maternity ward or midwife to double check.<br>  they are always there to help if you are worried or concerned about anything.|`|QnVWA8ycaa	BABY MOVEMENT.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	I am 36 weeks and 4 days and lately have had twitching in random muscles in MY body too not baby's lol...I think it's probably just cause so many vitamins are being taken away from us to go to the baby so it makes our bodies neurological systems do weird things, like have random muscle spasms. but it's not related to abirth defect---my baby doesnt have one they say. and I feel ehr move a lot too. sometimes her arm twitches and then my arm twitches it's very weird but funny.|`|uCLenopbaa	how far along are you?<br>  i'm pretty sure thats normal; because sometimes i feel that too.<br>  <br>  i'm 17 weeks tomorrow :)<br>  <br>  but i dont think i have felt the baby move yet- unless its the twitching idk.  i'm gonna ask my doctor tomorrow when i go to my appt.
PLK1p8cUaa	Unless your doctor has said not to it is usually safe especially if this is activity you have always done.  Safety issue is with equipment since a big belly can get in the way or cause you to be off balance but if you are concerned ask your doctor.  Good luck.|`|qA9JtQBMaa	I am a big believer in listening to your own body.<br>  <br>  Pregnancy is not a disability and unless you have complications there is no reason why you can't do light gardening work.<br>  <br>  If you feel up to it, then go for it - but stop if you start getting tired or sore and not too much physical stuff. Weeding is perfect.|`|MPNrL2uOaa	I wouldn't suggest it. Just be sure that you aren't over exerting yourself. You are very close to your due date so be sure to get plenty of rest and be careful. Also make sure you are drinking plenty of water when you go outside for a while. Just don't overdo it and you will be fine|`|xmVGViPiaa	You can do a little bit, but the moment you start to feel tired you need to take a break.  Make sure you drink plenty of fluids, too.|`|mABkbUG2aa	Just don't put to much strain on yourself. When you feel the least bit tired rest and drink plenty of fluids.|`|AA12360723	no|`|osCXgQZQaa	No I think you should taking it easy. Yard work is too strenuous for someone as far along as you are. Especially with the humidity of the summer.|`|84V4BuBsaa	i dont think so but if you really are concered i gest say when in dought throw it out or ii this case when in dought dont do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  hopr hid helped.|`|lX1Awuybaa	I wouldn't but if you are not working hard and your hydrated and keeping cool ( wearing a hat etc ) you should be fine. I am only 7 weeks though so I'm not far along like you!|`|es2IF5sFaa	no are you crazy not raking or weed whacking how about chillin out before the baby gets here hubby can do that or hire landscapers|`|ZhHfNrWuaa	no, you should not be doing anything that is strenous.
lA5Xi8qpaa	I didn't get a positive result til I went to the doctor 5 days after my missed period, all the HPT's were negative.  Good luck to you!|`|xmVGViPiaa	I found out I was pregnant about 18-20 days after I had sex, and even then it was a very very very faint positive line.  You should maybe wait another week and test again (I know it is hard, but that's really all you can do) or maybe see a Dr for a blood test.|`|ind1DKdraa	I would definately think you should have a positive by now. I would retake just in case your hcg levels just weren't high enough to show a positive. Also pms symtoms are often similar to pregnancy symptoms becuase our bodies produce the same hormones for both.|`|48a180567840ee2feac4a3775b4c87cdaa	Two weeks after unprotected sex should have been enough time for the test to show positive if you were pregnant.  However if you had a period then most likely you are not. Wait 2 more weeks then test again.|`|a4d04cdc560a7f7e939d240d530150cfaa	I got a positive result a week and three days after unprotected sex.  I had implantation bleeding about three days after that. <br>  <br>  Every woman is different, however.  I would guess that a pregnancy test two weeks after unprotected sex might be on the verge of too early.  Why don't you take another one if you don't want to wait till you miss your period???<br>  <br>  I know it's frustrating, but NO one can tell you whether you're pregnant or not for sure ... only a pregnancy test or a blood test can tell you for sure.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you get the result you're looking for!|`|VSBsTMqcaa	both pregnancies - 2wks after conception. BUT you must use your VERY first morning urine upon waking up. it's the most concentrated one with the highest level of pregnancy hormone.<br>  good luck!|`|nw7Yty8raa	Did you test before or after the implantation bleeding?|`|3a4e347ffda97fce6c93d4cd724fd7f3aa	i got my positve test 3 days after my missed period around 18-22 days after sex|`|uy6LSQ41aa	3 days before my period which may have been like 16 day after i had sex so i would sorry but yeah wait and see to be extra sure get a blood test|`|7rR11xZmaa	14 days with all 4 pregnancies|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	I got my positive result 9 days after sex, which was 3 days before my missed period.|`|GAxJNvxmaa	i got a positive test when i was 5 days late.
sUysQCxDaa	Having a baby is very exciting, but it changes your life completely! Wait until you guys are married, older, and sure of what you want in life. What if after you graduate, you decide you'd like to travel, teach overseas or volunteer in another country? With a baby, you won't be able to. What if you decide to go to college. It will be a lot harder with a little one! What if you decide to get married and have kids? Then you can do that. But wait to see what you decide to do before you rush into anything.<br>  Money is not all you need to be good parents-- you also need a stable home, and a lot of patience. Being a mom is wonderful, but it is hard work. So go with your gut and trust yourself-- now is definately not the right time. Wait until you are older and you will be a better mother, and happier with your choice.|`|xmVGViPiaa	You obviously are not ready to have a baby - if you were ready you would not even have a second thought about it.  Get through school and enjoy some of what life has to offer first (college, independence, money for yourself, traveling, etc).  Having a baby is a lot of work but it's so much more rewarding when you are older and independent and can have your own place, and the respect of your family and friends.|`|yDnz6Um1aa	well if your not ready dont do it, me and my boyfriend are about to be juniors and we are trying to have a baby but nothing is working so we are giving up, you really have your whole life in front of you, at least wait till your out of high school so you dont have to graduate being the size of a house, good luck.|`|tSjql8Tdaa	Just tell him straight if he wants a baby tell him to go have it himself. You sound like you have a sensible head on your shoulders you realise what you would give up if you had a child so dont let him ruin your future for you.|`|E9XEBA2vaa	Do what you feel is right.There are some people that can do it.If your up to it I can't object to your decision for I am 18 and have a child I was 17 when I had him and I dropped out of school when I was 15 and now I will be going to college this fall.Good luck.|`|ZhHfNrWuaa	You are too young, you have plans for the future, wait on the baby until you are ready. Your boyfriend probably won't stick around anyway.|`|a12ab3a1bf2d92640005610964029538aa	you already know it's a mistake so don't do it. babies aren't something you can save up for like a puppy. no matter how much you think you have something will come up and you will always need more money. your friends will leave you and go to college and your boyfriend who is obviously not the brains in your relationship will take off with someone who can go out and enjoy life rather than sit at home with a baby. i'm honestly not trying to be mean it's just that i really hate to see young people get in over their heads. not only do they suffer but so does their families and the babies that are born to them. babies are a blessing but one that can wait until you're older. go to college and then worry about children when you're financially stable. at 15 there's no way that kid can support you and a baby. he can't even work full time.|`|mroesp8Kaa	haha he doesnt have enough money saved up to make a baby im sure....do you or he realize how expensive a baby really is? Besides...its your body,and your life....You should go to school,get your education,and start a good well-paying career before you decide to have a baby....if he wants to have one now...he should find a new guinea pig...remember he can bail whenever he wants,its a lot harder for a mother after having the baby to give it up...and youd be stuck doing it alone....tell him if he wants to take care of a kid to start babysitting...when you have a kid you cant just hand them off to someone else when  they start to drive you nuts...you have to deal with them|`|FlZ37aAzaa	u better tell him people in hell want ice water, and that you are not ready, babies are not toys you can not get rid of them when he is done playing house, its your body and your choice.....you may want to think about the fact that anyone who is pressuring you and is not stable(money,full time job, education) may not have your best interest at heart...good luck|`|JX717tMpaa	I know he wants a baby buy if are not ready then I would not get pregnant.|`|wrkb6X81aa	DO NOT DO IT<br>  <br>  college will be completley out of the question|`|253c517c4642790de2ec89f7550391a4aa	WAIT!!!!!!!!!!If you are 17 that means he is 15?<br>  Please do not follow the path of ignorance!<br>  no matter how much he has saved up,babies are totally expensive and i cant imagine that he has a minimum of 50,000 dollars saved up which is the minimum you will need for the period of pregnancy and the first year of the babies live minus yoour own expenses.<br>  Note also that a baby is not a toy..it is a life human being that need s constant care and affection and attention,you are practically a baby yourself and your boyfriend is even younger.<br>  your chances of going to college will be ruined,and am sure your baby daddy will not stick around to fend for you so what wold you do then?<br>  please give it careful thought and at least wait till you finish high school then revisit the idea though i woul dsuggest that you actually wait till you fifnsh colege when am sure you will both understand and appreciate what having a child is about and be more responsible..<br>  though i doubt you guys will still be together by then!<br>  please take your time and dont let anyone rush you into anything...<br>  good luck|`|6TgpAPmTaa	Babies are a huge responsibility. Both of you are young and he is even younger. If you think you can handle it, by all means go ahead. But remember your going to have sleepless nights and wont be able to do a lot of things because you will have to care for a child. He may want a baby now, but once its here I think he will have a whole different perspective about it. He is still young and will have to give up a lot of things. One of you might have to quit school to help raise the child. I would try babysitting together and see how that goes. Make sure you are definitely sure about this because it really changes your life.|`|7bWvn9oIaa	I got pregnant at 16 and had my daughter when I turned 17. My suggestion to you would be to wait as long as you can. Not only does it take money but having a baby takes up all your free time. Right now I'm in my second year of college taking care of a two year old and trying to work at the same time. I hardly have time to spend with my friends and me and my daughters father are no longer together. I'm just barely making it through what should be the highlight of my life. I don't regret having my daughter because if I didn't have her I wouldn't push myself to want more for us but if I could go back I would have waited until I was done with college and had a good job and someone that i could spend the rest of my life with. He may think he wants a baby now but can he wake up every two hours for a feeding, can he buy clothes, diapers, formula, and every little accessory a baby needs. When he can't handle being a father will he leave you to take care of that baby by your self?Just wait!!!|`|bpYgd1zBaa	Tell him he can have as many kids as he can carry to term! :)<br>  <br>  Seriously... motherhood is forever, and your junior-in-high-school boyfriend may not be. Take some time to explore who you are as fledgling adults while you can -- you have many, many childbearing years ahead of you, and your baby can benefit from all you can learn about yourself as a person before he/she enters the scene.<br>  <br>  The fact that you're asking here tells me you have apprehensions about the matter. Talk to your boyfriend about them. If he wants to prove himself as a man, he'll be willing to wait AT LEAST until you've both got diplomas before trying to start a family. As lots of mommies I know will tell you, it's a hell of a lot easier than trying ot get them after you have kids...|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	He's too young to be daddy, and you're too young to be a mommy!  Don't let him pressure you into having a child!  If he won't respect your wishes, find a new love.|`|7xit1ogxaa	You use protection, you both are way too young to care for a baby if you are 17 and he is only 15. You need to finish high school, go to college, get married, and then think about having a baby. He may have a little money saved up, but honestly it will not go very far with what little education you two have at the moment. Babies are expensive, and until you have one you will truly have no idea how much money is needed.|`|TyiPJwsMaa	He sounds like a control freak.Ever heard of Tom Cruise.You need to finish school.What if he gets tired of you in a year?I think you should think about it for a year.I have never heard of a guy who wanted a baby at 17.This is weird and he sounds like a nut job.Sorry.|`|J6IOqzL0aa	dont be stupid this is a really bad idea. finish school and enjoy some of life first. Your bf savings will be used up in 2 seconds and then you will be screwed. There is nothing to keep him from leaving you anyway.|`|0e5f335b9ef0261a7abf1e33c21789b8aa	Then tell him to go have one............just not with YOU!|`|Dc3rr8B9aa	Having a baby while you're still in school/college is just out of the question. It's toooooo much work. College is NOTHING like high school, and it makes it even harder to care for a baby in between all those mid-terms, finals, projects, etc. I'm in college full-time and 28 weeks pregnant, trust me, nothing can prepare me for the stress I'm gonna have after the kid is here. It's just not a good idea. It wouldn't be fair to the baby if you neglected him/her to do homework. <br>  Babies are very expensive. I'm glad to have my family for whatever I need help with.<br>  <br>  Good luck and make the right decision.
BH43OgWFaa	Yes I do!  It's so weird.  It mostly comes and goes, but I've noticed it always seems to be worse in the evenings.  I just make sure i have some preggy pops to suck on or something sour because it helps with the nausea.  Good luck and hopefully it will pass soon!  :)|`|10bc1594147d9c6591dca7e48c5e3522aa	I'm not 100% sure i am pregnant yet, but i get sick at night more than in the day. and heart burn like WICKED around 1am .... makes me not be able to sleep and tums don't work.<br>  <br>  Hope your morning sickness doesn't last too long!!|`|sFI8Wjwyaa	I had that with my first son too. In the first few months and then it went to morning noon and night. UGH!! Good luck!!|`|eFk4erZoaa	yes I do but I work during the night so it's like my morning.|`|2HX9sIwpaa	yeah.. its really weird to.|`|xmVGViPiaa	Yes.  From about week 4 until week 11 I was sick 24 hours a day.  I am now 12 weeks pregnant and the nausea has gone away for the most part but I still get waves of bad nausea in the morning and at night.  Nothing really helps except for pretzels, preggie pops, water, and sleep.  Eating a protein and a carb before bed can help (I eat toast with cheese on it, or a piece of cheese with pretzels, or yogurt).  At least for me.  I hope you are feeling better soon -- remember this will all be worth it in the end!!
TkDJxRmDaa	With amnio, there's a chance you'll miscarry a perfectly healthy baby.  My wife and I were faced with this exact same dilemma, except your odds were actually BETTER than ours.  <br>  <br>  My wife asked, "If the baby has Downs, what can we do to cure her?"  The doctor said it's irreversible.  My wife said, "Well then, why the heck would I want to risk killing the baby just to satisfy my own curiosity?  I mean, won't I find out when the baby is born anyway?"<br>  <br>  She said this baby would be loved regardless of whether or not she had Down's.  She declined all further Downs-related tests and six months later, she gave birth to our daughter.<br>  <br>  A 100% healthy baby girl.<br>  <br>  If you know you'll love this baby, just relax and have a good pregnancy.  Assume that your baby is fine because, odds are, there is NOTHING wrong with him/her.  <br>  <br>  And this same thing has happened to at least five other couples that we know personally, which makes me wonder if they do these unnecessary tests just to make more money off of us.|`|FvVqFFrNaa	girl, I am there with you. I am 25 and got a 1/497 result. which is abnormal for my age so i go in tuesday for another sonogram. I wouldnt get the amnio if I were you. It is risky as they go into the baby's living environment and take out fluid. Remember, the Downs test has a ton of false positives. My boss got a 1/20 and had the amnio and said it was a nightmare. Her boy does not have Down's. she told me with her 2nd she didnt even get the test because it was just too much stress over nothing<br>  <br>  edit: they say the risk of autism is 1/150. They are chances with everything, but think of it this way. even if they are right, if you had 250 babies, 1 would have Down's. Thats a very small risk :o)|`|Q7FniHtuaa	Neither.<br>  Ultrasounds can show certain markers for DS, there is no reason to do anything more invasive to test.  With an amnio, there is a risk of miscarriage.<br>  If the little one does happen to be born with DS, yes, there are challenges to face, but also remember that children with DS are the most loving and giving, and can live rewarding lives.  :)<br>  I wish you all the best.|`|L050cg11aa	You have to decide if it's going to matter whether or not your child has Down.  If it isn't going to matter, then why do the tests that put your baby's life at risk?  They can't do anything about it anyways.  I read up on some Down forums and found that the tests the docs do really aren't much help.  It seemed that some were told that their baby would be normal, and wasn't, and some were told that their baby had Down, and turned out to be healthy.<br>  <br>  My daughter had several markers for Down but I decided against getting an amnio because I would have and love her regardless.  A friend of mine got bullied into having an amnio and ended up losing the baby because of it.  The, by the way, perfectly healthy baby.|`|bWvqj955aa	The blood tests they use to determine "markers" are very unreliable.  Your midwife should be able to verify that for you.  Mine came back with abnormal showings for Spina Bifida, a neural tube defect, as did a friend of mine...  we both have perfectly healthy 2 year olds now.<br>  <br>  Does it really matter anyway?  Regardless you will love your baby. <br>  <br>  My M-I-L swears that the amnio is what caused her son's seizures... I'd advise against it.  Too much risk for no reason at all...<br>  <br>  And as hard as it is, try not to worry about it too much.   Stress is not good for either of you.  That blood test stressed me out so bad during my last pregnancy, I will opt out of it next time.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  :)|`|pGj5rQONaa	First you have to ask youself if it matters if your baby has Downs.  If you would want to abort your baby just because it has Down's, then you should get the CVS testing. <br>  If you will love your baby no matter what type of DNA configuration it has, then dont have either test.  Both types of tests have a risk of miscarriage or stillbirth.  <br>  The other reason to find out before the baby is born if it has downs would be to start looking into special education preschools and such.  But, I dont think that its necessecary to do all the intrusive tests to find out 7 months sooner than you would if you just wait til the baby is born.  <br>  We had a "scare" with our second son for the possiblity of having Down's.  I did all the research and decided just to wait and see.  From the ultrasounds we saw a nasal bone and feet that were not clubbed, so we figured he would be fine, and he was.<br>  P.S. I'm also 23 and have two kids with the same partner... we are both young, its not likely that the baby will have down's.

I have four kids, and three of them have medical training. When my eldest so, who is a doctor, finally passed his medical license, my classmate/doctor, best man, best friend, and godfather of my second child, also a doctor,  has this to say for my son: : Tell him not to get married yet ( after twenty-six years of schooling), because when he  takes his residency training, also called specialization, which needs another three years, it would be hard for him, or his wife, and even for the kid. Wow ! I was thinking he'd say he can manage to get married already! Now, can you imagine how hard it will be for you and your wife to realize your dreams?

Though I was a little bit older than you when I had my daughter (16) I can still tell you that you are making the right choice! My fiance was killed in Iraq two years ago an since then she has been my world. People will tell you that you are making the wrong choice, that you are to young, and that you will ruin your life. Please do not listen to them. You may have made a "mistake" and gotten pregnant so young but the first time you see your children will make it all worth while. As for your education, It will be beyond tough, there will be long day, and even longer nights, the best advice I can give is to pray, all good things come together in the hands of the Lord. A Ph.D is just about ten years off school, have you thought of doing anything else? There are many high paying healthcare careers that require only an A.S or B.S degree and you would be able to support your girl and children much easier, and after you have you feet on the ground it would be much easier to go back to school for that Ph.D.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck and all my prayers,<br>  <br>  Cowgirl|`|JA5ecFCFaa	My best friends sister just grad from highschool with a 3 year old.

Where the heck are the parents in this? Did they not teach their kids about sex and what could potentially happen if they had unprotected sex? <br>  <br>  Reality: a 14 and 15 year old are just not ready to deal with a baby let alone 2(there are adults who are not ready!). I have a 15 yr old girl (step daughter) and a 15 year old son, and there is no way at their age they would be capable of raising a baby, they have far to many other things on the go. Like being a teenager.<br>  <br>  These kids should be enjoying their high school years. It is going to be hard, it is hard enough when you are older and sorta secure financially to raise kids at times. At 14 I don't know how you can so confidently say you are keeping the babies. You have no clue what it is going to be like once those babies enter this world. It is going to be hard....you will have to make sacrifices. I sure hope for both your sakes and for the sakes of the babies you  both finish school, cuz life will be a whole lot harder if you don't.<br>  <br>  Something both you and your girlfriend should consider doing is taking parenting courses. Seriously you are going to need to figure out how to raise these babies. Someone is going to have to provide all the necessities of life for these babies. Are you going to work and go to school? Will that be enough to support 2 babies? Or are you going to expect everyone else to take care of your babies?? <br>  <br>  What happens when you decide a year down the road you want to be a teenager with out responsibilities again? or if you or your girlfriend decide you want to go out and have fun with your friends?( i am not talking about 1 night i am talking about many nights!) What do you do with the babies? Do you get your parents to baby sit while you go and have fun? Do you pass your babies off to who ever? Being a teenage parent is not going to be easy, it is hard, ask someone who is one, and some of them will tell you they miss being a teenager and they wish they could do the things their friends do.|`|EALy7X7Gaa	wooow,, well first of all i'm glad you two are keeping the babies =] and taking responsibly for it but raising two kids on your own is going to be tough especially since your kids yourself and have no idea what your doing. i suggest having your girlfriend take some parenting classing and maybe you join along with her ,, also make sure to tell your parents your going to be needing alot of help and support from them in the near future.<br>  i hope everything works out =]|`|sLkYSdoBaa	wow.....i dont know what a PHD in medical check ups is but if you are talking about being a doctor then you have 4 years of high school, 4 years of medical school, a year as an intern, then resedency for the field you choose which can be from 3-5 years before you finish school. i hope you guys have very supportive parents to help with all this. good luck|`|F2ib6LSfaa	its going to be tuff no dout about it but where there is a will there is a way congratulations on the baby's and good luck with everything|`|8f203173daa65e2f8761ca39597e0ba9aa	thats life dude, you play you pay, welcome to the real world
IzavWfCgaa	Anne Frank is now such an icon after her story was published and people began to read it.I read it in school this year and it was really amazing.I'm sure that when your daughter is old enough to understand that book she will be proud to be named after such a role model.The fact that Anne Frank is your hero should make your daughter even more proud of her name.Plus Annelise Marie is a beautiful name.So no way would it be stupid to name your daughter after her.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck with your daughter in the future!|`|MlLEOvAaaa	Not at all!  I think it is a beautiful way to honour such a remarkable young lady.|`|bMZ7lOfVaa	No...I think it's a great name. I grew up reading Anne Frank's books and I loved them. It's a good person to name your baby after.|`|dwFOTwKtaa	Not at all...it gives her name a purpose and when she learns who she was named after she will most likely research Anne Frank and learn all about her which is good because Anne Frank was a tremendous inspiration to millions.

Who wouldn't want to be named after Anne Frank, she was such an amazing person that went through so much, but still stayed strong.  I'm glad that her story changed your life.  I'm sure if she were alive she would feel so blessed knowing that her sorrows and her strength give people hope even today.<br>  <br>  Congrats and I really do love the name!!!|`|z2leU9Ogaa	Annelise Marie is really pretty.<br>  if you idolise someone as much as you claim to then go for it.<br>  if she was your aunt you would do it but because shes a little famous you're thinking twice about it.<br>  if you and your partner are both happy with it then go for it !<br>  good luck : )|`|CdTP1UtVaa	Non sense!<br>  <br>  I have seen many 'inspiration' names people give their kids, and it's always something dumb, like Kendlyin Rosy..<br>  <br>  But besides how great she was for you, she has a beautiful name.

Her hormones are a little off the wall at the moment, and she's feeling like crap most likely  as it is. I would be very upset if someone flirted with my husband while I was pregnant. It's kinda disrespectful overall. She really needs support and isn't feeling sexy either. It's almost mocking saying' hah I'm thin and can act girly because I'm not pregnant'<br>  <br>  it could've made her feel alone like it was just her and the baby and that no one is respecting her feelings at such a fragile time. And since she's had the baby she wants and needs to feel like she has a loyal husband who will help her and stay by her side.<br>  <br>  I would tell her that you didn't realize that flirting would upset her so much during this, you really valued your friendship, and truly miss it.<br>  <br>   hope things go better for you|`|xmVGViPiaa	Sometimes when women get pregnant and have a child the relationship with their husband gets stronger... I have become much more attached to my boyfriend since I became pregnant and I know we will both feel even more strongly about each other after the baby is born.

She will either accept or not, and there is nothing you can do but move on if she does not accept.  She may also be very busy with her new baby.  People change a lot during and after pregnancy, it is a huge life-changing event for most people.|`|3jH7EWTFaa	Well maybe she only acted like she was okay with the flirting. Maybe she just finally got really sick and tired of it. There is no way of telling when she will get over it, you need to just stop flirting with her husband.

Obviously something is very important to her.|`|g2IUJaZCaa	Just because your best friends does not give you the right to flirt with him.

Maybe the way things use to be don't sit right with her anymore. I understand what you said about the fact that it USE to be okay. Try not to be too offended, because really, flirting with each others' spouses isn't the best thing for friends to do anyway, don't you think?  She apparetly does now, so if you are prepared to respect that and truly want to be friends again, yes, call and apologize, and tell her you won't do it again, your friendship is more important. <br>  <br>  The reason this may have upset her so much this time could be because she feel her husband may really like you, and at the time,she was pregnant, and when you're pregnant, you're at least 2 things- emotional (irrational) and territorial with your man! <br>  <br>  Truly though, best of luck getting things back to normal.

Just muster up the courage to sit them down and tell them the truth...Tell them you know they are mad but you love them and really need their help and support right now...they will come around eventually...Goodluck|`|ro7oUXtQaa	If ur bf is willing to stay with u no matter what there is no reason to be worried. try to tell ur parents, and tell them that ur bf is going to stay w/ u. i don't think that ur parents will kick u out, after all theyll always be there for u no matter all the mistakes u make.|`|E0Lybd6Vaa	You better hope they don't have him charged for rape. <br>  <br>  They are going to find out sooner or later.<br>  <br>  Of course they may be disappointed, but there should be no reason why they would leave their child out on the street.|`|FelNy3txaa	write them a letter. and tell them that you do not want to abort the baby or put it up for adoption. tell them you know you made a mistake, even if you didn't, its what parents want to hear. and let them know that you are really sorry you lied to them about having sex and that you wish you would've been more responsible. ask them to support you and tell them that they only need to talk to you when and only when they have actually calmed down, whether that means they need to go take a drive before they talk to you or what. but let them know telling them was hard enough, but you really need them. because at 5 months you need some serious medical attention, just tell them. its going to be hard and you both are going to be upset, but it has to be done and you need to do it. they will know something eventually when you are sitting on the toliet pushing out a kid.|`|UwN2elTMaa	I was in the same boat as you...just pray he is loyal to you but Just tell your parents they will respect the fact that you told them.  waiting any longer isn't fair to your unborn child...I dont want to sound mean but you baby needs prenatle tell your parents you have something to tell them and say you will tell them tomarrow or something like that and have Alex with you and if you freeze have him say it to them. It will be very hard to tell them but trust me after telling them you will be better off|`|EN4ltMEWaa	You both need to be there to tell ur parents and do it soon.  You will feel so much better to get it off ur shoulders also they will be able to help you, I highly doubt they will react as u think although they will initially be upset.  Once ur parents start thinking about it as their future grandkid they will be excited.  They will prolly be most concerned about u finishing high school and the father being around for you.|`|xmVGViPiaa	There's no secret to how to tell your parents.  You just have to tell them.  They may not take it the way you think they will, and if they do they may get over it and start thinking about your baby.  I really hope you have been seeing a Dr and taking prenatal vitamins, and if you haven't been, then it's very important you start doing that now.|`|Lja64RnUaa	ok calm down.  you are not the first 16 year old to have sex and get pregnant.  your parents love you and will love your baby.  however,  this will be a shock and they may freak.  sit them down together, and calmly tell them.  i would suggest not having your boyfriend there.  your parents are going to want to hear your plans, finishing school, jobs, babysitters, etc.  think all this out before you talk to them.  but you HAVE to tell them soon.  good luck!|`|aEUuP5lsaa	ill help you.<br>  DONT COME HERE TALKING ABOUT IT.<br>  honestly ... we can't help you.<br>  YOU had unprotected sex.<br>  YOU knew the consequences.<br>  YOU did this to yourself.<br>  no body on here can help you.<br>  you have to be able to grow up and tell your parents.<br>  you should have thought about hurting them before you had sex and got yourself pregnant. They should kick you out to show you what your doing to yourself. You obviously wanted something when you did this, so grow up and take it. Your 16, you should have known.|`|afd088f7879ccc24f0e69fd1c1cf6619aa	If you are already 5 months, you dont have long before everyone will know. And plus, you need to tell your parents, yeah, they will probably freak out at first, but they will come around. Believe me, if my daughter came to me, I would be very upset, but I love her and would help in any way possible. Tell them!|`|jPC6OzHGaa	Look Love,<br>  Bring everyone togetter. .<br>  and Tell them You Have to Do it anyway So just do it as Fast as you can..<br>  <br>  trust me if there going to kick you out, there gonna do it when ever you tell them,  Most Likey You wont  get kicked out...<br>  <br>  Good Luckkk Sweetie =/|`|g95rMYYwaa	well it will be worst if u tell later but i,d tell them now no matter how scared iam because i hope u went to see a doctor or something .. your parents will only be mad at first and they probaly wont kick you out my mom  said the same thing and now theyre buying bab stuff|`|EPYTZyYgaa	I would write it in a letter, and tell her to call you after she reads it if she is going to support you.  If I was that scared, thats what I would do.  Are your parents uppity? is it going to hurt their image in their eyes? If they aren't they will probably be ok once they get over the shock of it.  I would just encourage you to continue your schooling.  Don't give up your chance for educating yourself just because you have a baby coming.  I did that, and I severely regret it.  Now, I am busting my butt trying to make ends meet.  So good luck with the baby.  Just tell your mom the baby will bring more love into your family.|`|IFz8GcrPaa	All young people are scared to tell their parents. I was, because I am 20. I am engaged and was before I found out I was pregnant. I am the baby in the family, and I kept it from my parents for 4 months. When I told them, my mom was more disappointed, and my dad was 'not pleased' lol as he said. But after a day LITERALLY they got over it. I figured it just gave them another reason to spoil the poop out of a grandchild. My sister has a girl that is 1 1/2, my brothers son is 10 months, and Im next. There isnt any other way to tell them, other than TELLING them, really. I know its scary, and what im saying may not even help. But, you would be shocked at how things turn around and how they want to help you.|`|VvM3ysEXaa	i know exactly what youre going through. i was pregnant at 16, so was my mother. the best you can do is sit down with your parents and the father of your child for a talk. be calm, this will show your parents you are being mature about it. whatever you do, dont fight with them. keep your cool even if they lose it. a good parent will be there for you and support you. if they kick you out, its their loss. just know there is always help. i dont know where you live, so i cant give you specific numbers. but planned parenthood is a good place for help. also make sure you are connected with a hospital and have an OBGYN. if you dont have insurance, dont worry. the state will hook you up with insurance. good luck!|`|Y3JLz5XHaa	I'm glad the father is supporting you. I'm sure that in your community, there is a Planned Parenthood that can help you find some assistance being a teen mother. And it is EXTREMELY important to be seeing a doctor. Teenagers are at risk for more complications during pregnancy without prenatal care.<br>  <br>  That being said, before you tell your parents, is there another adult in your life that you could tell first? Maybe an aunt or a teacher? That adult could help you break it to your parents or at least be there for the fallout if they stupidly kick you out. I hope they don't, but I know it happens.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you. Please reach out and get some community support. It is so hard being a teenage mom.|`|hdRgPMAkaa	Ok it always is the best way to be Honest. I am a mother and my daughter was pregnant at 17 she also didn't tell me she hide it from me for 4 months. I was heart broken she didn't tell me either, I would of been upset at first but I would of talked to her and her boyfriend about it. She than turned 18 and moved out and to another state so she could be near her boyfriend. She than send me a text message telling me. PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!!!! I than called her and told her I love her and we would get through it, Now I have the most amazing little grandson ever, She is a great Mom and the daddy is great too. But you and Alex need to go to your parents and talk to them like adults, you are going to be a mommy yourself soon and you need to act like one. So get with Alex and set up a good time SOON to talk to your parents. Good luck to you|`|LWzrCu5caa	Depending upon the state you are in,   it could be statutory rape.   Your 20 year old boy friend could be in big trouble,  specially if your parents decide to press charges.<br>  <br>  Probably too late for an abortion,  so you are going to have the kid.   Your parents will figure it out pretty soon.    You had better have a plan on how to tell them than just saying, "Mom and Dad,  I am pregnant."     <br>  <br>  I suggest you seriously consider putting the kid up for adoption.  If you start now,  you can arrange for a nice couple to get the kid right at delivery.  They also might be willing to pay the bills,  which may be a major concern of your parents.    <br>  <br>  On the really weird off chance the 20 year old who "really loves you" says he wants to marry you,  he had better be able to support you.  That would be a good thing to figure out before you agree to marriage.   I bet he will not make this offer.  <br>  <br>  On the other side,  if he refuses to put the kid up for adoption while at the same time refuses to marry you,   your choice is simple.   Give him the child.    That way you can finish school.|`|cji3A8EOaa	calm down hun. i know what you are going through im 15 and i just told my dad that i was pregnant. your parents might get upset but thats normal for them. you just have to make them see it the way that you do. i took me awhile to tell my dad im almost 2 months now and i told him just the other day. just explain things to them and hope things turn out for the best
b48e9d7f6ac0d95898f67523de6b6cf4aa	Yup.  I just had my 3rd and the pain started much earlier than with my 2nd child.<br>  <br>  I never had that pain at all with my 1st child.  With my 2nd child the pain started at the beginning of the 3rd trimester...<br>  <br>  With my 3rd child I had the pains starting at around 17-18 weeks!!!<br>  <br>  The more children you have, the easier your pelvis spreads and the sooner we feel it!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|PQuevuSVaa	yes it is very normal.  i started having pains on my pelvic area during the 3rd month of my pregnancy.  every woman is different and every pregnancy of a woman is  also different.=)  enjoy your pregnancy! congratulations!=)|`|xrNDC6VRaa	Isnt that called that stretching of the ligaments down there?<br>  I have this and its not always pleasant mostly like menstrual cramps :( and sometimes Im even moody as if on my period...<br>  Sucky... yet so worth it when they make it into the world finally lol...|`|E0Lybd6Vaa	I had multiples and and yes, I had pain during month 4-5|`|xmVGViPiaa	Yes that is perfectly normal.

b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	First time out the gate I wasn't working and my husband was making about 35K a year. Things weren't that bad. This time around our income is about 80K with our second child. They both are in daycare and it's expensive. It was enough. No I would not have waited because I believe money isn't the cure-all...if your relationship sucks money means nothing. If it's great you can make it work with next to nothing. I wouldn't change anything.|`|gx4s68s8aa	Without stating exact figures- My husband a I waited until we owned our own home and he was making enough for me to quit working once our baby was born.  For us it is important for one person to be home with our child especially until she goes to grade school.  I am glad that we waited until then.   Daycare is great, but I really wanted to be able to stay at home with our child.|`|JQcIwPXJaa	We made about 72K  a year, but I stopped working when I was 34 weeks pregnant and our income dropped to 30K. I decided not to go back and now we're at 33K. It's really hard, but we feel that it's important for me to be at home with our kids. It's a lot of work to live on a tight budget, but we make it happen and it's worth it. I wouldn't change anything.|`|cO10vvWsaa	Well, im pregnant right now and my husband doesn't make much, he makes like 800 dollars a week. im currently not working, Im just a full time student in college, but finishing in 2 years after 4 years of nonstop college.<br>  <br>  This is enough for me.

We used my income on all out bills and baby things and used half of his income to save so I could stay home and finish school.  When I quit working, it was only $20,000 and that was a real strain on us, but it was decent.|`|7xit1ogxaa	I am due this fall. My husband currently brings in $2500/month and I bring in $4000/month.

We had enough saved to where he took about 3 months off. He then started at a temp agency making $6 an hour! lol...we still had savings left over to live on untill he was hired on with the company and within 90 days went to 12/hr. It was more than enough for us to live on. Things were really cheap here...we rented a place for 235 a month. Then bought our first new vehicle a month after the baby was born. Bought our house when she was 21 months old, on an acre of land 2 miles off the second largest lake in the state. We now have 2 kids, and I'm 15 weeks 1 day with our 3rd and last. He's making 700-800/week.....and we're doing beautifully financially. If I were also working....I don't know what we'd do with all the extra income other than invest, buy another property, pay this one off sooner than we planned (8 years left to payoff now, at the rate we're paying it off).

tifwOvBxaa	I agree with the other comment. Seems like your Dad has a lot of problems mentally, and they way he treated your sister and now you is not justified. I would not have him in your life anymore. You and your sister did the right thing about your step brother, That is so disgusting bi-polar or not what he did to you. I would tell your Mom to call you for now and and stay in touch with her through emails if you can. Just try not to stress since you're pregnant, and avoid any sort of conflict for now on. So sorry you had to go through such a hard childhood.|`|r4G15EhBaa	I'm sorry this is happening to you. Try not to let it stress you. I just want to know why your mom is still with your dad if all this has happened? I wouldn't talk to either one of them but that is me. You just need to take care of you and your baby. Good Luck and Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|xmVGViPiaa	A lot of people have fathers who are jerks, you aren't the only one and you can't let it get to you.  He probably doesn't understand why you feel the way you do about your half brother... If anything you should just tell your mother to call you, maybe code it so that she calls and rings once, hangs up and then calls again so you know it is her and not your father calling.  I wouldn't have any more contact with your father if I was you.
JPrUz4LJaa	Yes! Pre C u m can get you pregnant too! Be Careful!|`|xmVGViPiaa	Yes.|`|5Jn3Wkbeaa	Yes. Pre-ejaculate|`|dzmFtzKHaa	There is always a risk if you are having unprotected sex.  He doesnt have to *** in you. There is a such think as pre-ejaculation.<br>  <br>  Protection everytime is the best birth control.|`|mxCb5K5kaa	YES of course.even if u do it once "unprotected "  you risk urself|`|cpg03T2yaa	You may get pregnant even on the first time, I did. You may want to take a morning after pill within 72 hours from the time you had intercourse. That will weaken the sperm that's in you and you will hopefully not get pregnant. I would get on birthcontrol and condoms next time because you will be faced with more questions. 1) Do you want to keep the baby? 2) Can you afford a baby? 3) Do you want to go through abortion? or have $ for it? 4)Are you ready to be a mother? etc. These are many questions you have to ask yourself. Also you have to think of other consequences such as STDS/HIV/AIDS, just because it's your first time doesn't mean you can't catch something. Also you may not be able to see just visually if the guy has an STD/HIV/AIDS.
GB1fJSPpaa	its really up to your body when you get morning sickness. Generally for most people I know it takes a few weeks, but for me it started within a week after I ovulated. Even though I had all the symptoms I waited to take my test until I missed my period. I was scared to be disappointed since I had two previous miscarriages and a lot of negitive tests. I'm 38 weeks now and ready to pop any day. <br>  <br>  Sometimes its not all in your head, sometimes you just know. Its different for everyone. I'd probably just wait until youre a couple days before your period and take an early pregnancy test. That's only a suggestion though.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Morning sickness can come on pretty quick.  Wait until your missed period and take a test.  Good luck!|`|xmVGViPiaa	Yes.  I got morning sickness about 7 days after I conceived.  Some peoples' bodies are more sensitive to the hormones than others... Just eat as long as you can!  If you get morning sickness anything like I did, you'll not be able to eat anything you want to for about 13 weeks, so enjoy eating what you want to while you can :)  I hope this is it for you!  It really sounds like it is.|`|qBrBvvedaa	It is definitely possible.  I started feeling symptoms about 2 weeks after we conceived.  My first symptoms were severe aversions to garlic and lunch meat, nausea, and I was just so tired all the time.|`|0C9LhSAGaa	sure sounds like it.. it sure is possible..give it another week or so and take a test! i so hope u are! lots of baby dust to you hun!
xmVGViPiaa	Yep!  I've had this since I was 4 weeks along and I am now almost 15 weeks pregnant.  It's such a bummer having to force yourself to eat -- but you have to get through it.  It will get better, just make sure you are keeping something in your tummy at all times.|`|YJETYdcOaa	I'm 6 weeks right now, and I'm experiencing the same thing. It makes me feel good to know someone else is going through this. I don't feel sick necessarily, just really nothing sounds good to me. I may even feel hungry during the day, but I'll sit there and think of ANYTHING that sounds good, and absolutely nothing does. I'm worried I'm not gaining weight like I should. I think it's really fine, and that most of these weird eating habits, like food aversions will go away in the next trimester. Good luck with all of that. Sorry I can't help, but at least you know you aren't alone!|`|U6opk5qraa	I'm so glad I read this question and these answers. My husband thinks I'm crazy because he'll suggest things for dinner and I normally have such a strong appetite but nothing sounds good at all. I've been sticking to things like pizza and breakfast foods - because they don't sound terrible like eveything else. I think it's totally normal as I had a friend tell me she experienced this in pregnancy as well.<br>  <br>  You're fine.|`|qM1FNpqPaa	Completely normal.  I didn't have bad morning sickness, but I had zero appetite.  Sometimes only 1 thing would sound even remotely good to me, so that's what I would eat.  Your appetite will pick up later!|`|j64urmgvaa	call ur doc good luck|`|9lKUHgTCaa	yes this is normal.at some stages of preguanty, you will have an appteitte, and at some stages you'll have no appittte what so ever
AA11543189	you sound pregnant try first response it worked on the day of my missed period|`|xmVGViPiaa	2 weeks after your period is generally the most fertile time for most women.  So you have a high chance of becoming pregnant.  ASAP find out about plan B, most pharmacies will sell it to you over the counter and if you take that as soon as you can then you may be able to avoid pregnancy.|`|i0kM6Rn2aa	Yes. You should be concerned. Take the test when your next period should come. <br>  <br>  Your parents are your parents and they will love you regardless, though they might be a bit disappointed. <br>  <br>  If you're too scared to ask your mom to get you on the pill (which means you aren't mentally ready to be having sex, but that's not going to stop you, clearly...) try telling her your period cramps are really bad and you're irregular. A doctor will put you on the pill automatically for those symptoms and you don't have to tell your mom you're sexually active.  And have him wear a condom, as even with the pill you can still get pregnant.|`|yZr1zfh9aa	well. first of all if you had unprotected sex today then go to planned parenthood and ask about the morning after pill. it should be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex and your parents wont have to know. and for pete's sake hunnie with all the ads about wrapping it up and the aids epidemic you couldnt just go to planned parenthood and get FREE condoms to forego this whole thing? wrap it up!!|`|IqopZc0qaa	I would be concerned if you don't get your period within the next few weeks.<br>  <br>  As for telling your parents...that's a tough one.  It all depends on the situation.  Are you in high school? College?  Do you know who the father would be?  Are you together?  One night stand?  Engaged?  <br>  <br>  For me, I was engaged when I got pregnant.  I thought my father was going to be pissed.  I didn't know how to tell him, so I just gave him the ultrasound picture and let him figure it out.  Once he knew what it was, he looked at me (I had tears in my eyes) and he gave me a hug and told me it will be alright.  He really surprised me.|`|aDVoSo10aa	womens and teen health source|`|Xm4swiPhaa	Oh gee... I remember this......  Yes it is possible to fall pregnant now....  If you dont want it then go and ask your doc for morning after pill ( and the pill as well for future ) and if you do then just wait and see.<br>  <br>  As for your parents..... tell them as soon as you know you are but also know what you want...  I wanted to keep my baby ( i dont believe it abortion) and people kept telling me I was too young and to get rid of it. So Know what you want first so you arent rail roaded into doing something you will regret.<br>  <br>  They may be hurt, dissappointed and mad but they will come around and if they dont, there is lots of places that will help get you on your feet.|`|AA10229894	Yes you could get pregnant.  See about getting Plan B, the morning after pill.  You can take it within 3 days of having unprotected sex.  If you are 18 then you can get it at most drugstores without a prescription, if under 18 then you need a prescription at the drugstore, or try Planned Parenthood.  If you don't, then wait until you miss your period to take a test.  As for your parents, the best way is to just be honest and tell them, of course they are going to be upset and disappointed.
Wjdpm4xNaa	yes, the areola around the nipple gets bigger and darker....i noticed it at about 3 months or so...|`|r7dYHFLtaa	Yes..<br>  Like when you're about 4 months..|`|nw7Yty8raa	LOL! Mine looked bigger...they were always huge and hard...and I don't even nip out when it's cold!!! I noticed 2 weeks after conception...and went and bought a pregnancy test...4 positive tests later...I finally believed I was pregnant...still LOL!<br>  <br>  Best of Luck|`|e58e350901ca0d8b8e9821d3543ab129aa	Yes!  I'm not sure when mine got bigger.  Maybe 3-4 months.  They also get darker.  Here is some good info.|`|xmVGViPiaa	They can and it varies from woman to woman.  Mine started changing a few days after I missed my period.|`|d8TgfgCgaa	yes...and darker mine started changine about 15-20 weeks...way bigger lol|`|B8UgPYNsaa	yes they do quite big!|`|hKuvL8u4aa	yes mine did and i would guess it would depend on your horomones
8fX7iv07aa	My friend's daughter had the samething happen, I know it scared you very much, but you cannot predict it wether it will happend again, it's like playing the lottery.  <br>  <br>  So just keep your kids healthy and warm, keep them clean and everything they touch clean.  Wash their bedding and pillow cases often along with their clothes and blankets.  Also give them chewable vitamins daily as well along with some fruit if they do not like vegetables.  If this is not normal to you its time for a change.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have Motrin/Tylenol with a thermometer with you at all times, and memorize your pediatrician's phone number.<br>  <br>  Overal focus on making their immune system stronger!  Good luck.  My kid is 4 and has had 8 ear infections since she was born, so I am extremely a germ-o-phobe.  But you gotta love your kids, so its all well worth it!|`|SU8z0TUoaa	This happened to a friend of ours. Their little boy got a fever, had a seizure, stopped breathing and died. It was terrible. Not trying to scare you, but please keep some children's liquid Tylenol on hand as well as a good thermometer. If she ever acts sick or looks flushed, like with red rosy cheeks, check her temp. Once she gets to 5 or so the danger should be past.<br>  |`|vDmWMQ7Faa	When my brother was I think 9 months old his fever went real high and he got a seizure. Then a few months later he got another one. Then a few weeks prior to that one got another and that was the last one. He is four now and is doing fine but when he gets sick we are very cautious. They eventually grow out of it the doctor said its just when he was a baby his body couldn't handle being sick and just lost control. So dont worry but be cautious! Also i hope the doctore told you what you do when your daughter gets seizures. |`|beGSQMAYaa	My son had a fever seizure last Dec. After his first CAT scan and EEG the doctors said nothing was wrong. But my son kept having seizures for months after when we least expected them and some times in his sleep. The doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy this year in June. I hope your daughter comes out ok and  that it was a one time thing. I know how you feel it hurts so bad to see your child sick and there is nothing you can do about it.
go3lmCv6aa	If your last menses was on 09/12/08 (assuming that was the first day) you could be experiencing ovulation....which usually occurs 14 days after the first day of your last mensus; and can cause some of the symptoms you are describing.   <br>  When did you have unprotected intercourse?  First Response, which in my 4 pregnancies has been very reliable and accurate wouldn't pick up a pregnancy until around the 5-7th of October. I don't know any other methods other than a blood test at the doctor. Hope this helps.|`|0jDKsz3Baa	I know it's hard to wait..we all have to go through it. Wait until right around your period and take an early detection test. If your period is late you can go get a blood test.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Nope.  Just wait until your period is due, and take a test.  First Response can detect pregnancy up to 5 days before a missed period, but it's not very accurate.
qygYwdRpaa	A little pamper kit you cant go wrong after having a baby its lovely to have a bit of time to yourself with some lovely smellys etc ahh that's really sweet of you she is lucky to have a sister like you.|`|AA11131747	You're a sweet sister.  After I had my baby, a friend brought me some silky nursing pajamas, which I greatly appreciated. For one thing it was nice to have easy access for nursing, and for another thing it was nice to actually wear something "sexy" for a change after being pregnant all those months.|`|AA11795652	Food!!!  My mom brought over tons of groceries and my mother-in-law brought over dinners she made for us and take-out.  It was nice to not have to worry about what to eat when all our energy was going to the baby.  Time!  Sometimes, all I want is a nice long shower and to know my baby is being held and taken care of while I do that.  Your time would be greatly appreciated.|`|WnWO1iHSaa	A "coupon" she can redeem for your time or services!  What about a coupon saying you will come fold her laundry? Or load the dishwasher, vacuum, hold the baby while she takes a nap, etc.  Those are the "presents" I wanted when I had my babies!  But if you are set on giving a tangible gift, I think a gift certificate for a massage or manicure would be nice, new pjs (for sitting home cuddling baby in) or a gift basket with girly lotions and bath salts.  You are a very nice sister too! |`|aWU6YCH3aa	Old Navy has Mommy and Me pajamas for the mommy and baby, they match its really cute. <br>  Or make her a cute little coupon for a nap, in which you'll watch the baby or a few hours to herself.|`|ed1fd474ffe907b183e2991c2f9b248daa	Perhaps a pedicure or a massage. Aren't you lovely?!|`|icBCnR2baa	How sweet of you :) You could give her a present of some "her time" pick a time in advance and arrange to babysit while she goes out and has some time to herself or maybe to get things done she doesn't usually have time to do now that the baby has arrived. Or offer to do some chores around the house, it may not be an actual store bought gift, but small gestures from the heart mean so much more than purchases from a store and she can use these now. Good luck.|`|7c5ex252aa	one of the best gifts you can give is to bring her over a few meals after the baby is born, easy stuff she can keep in the fridge/freezer and heat up.  either that, or give her a gift certificate for a massage, cant' go wrong there, she'll love it after having the baby!|`|AA12037596	What about some really nice bath foam so she can have a good soak when she gets some free time to herself,as every new mum knows these times are few and far between,or treat her to a manicure and pedicure,just something to make her feel pampered.
B9Yfgjcbaa	I know that I have two children. The first one was conceived in January and born/due in October.  The second one was conceived in December and born/due in September.  If I go by my own experiences, if she was due in August she conceived in November.  I would say there is a chance you are the daddy.  I would get a lawyer and demand a DNA paternity test, because if it is yours, she shouldn't keep it from you if you want your rights.  That is my advice.|`|PtfaM7jEaa	take a DNA test you have a right to know since you had sex with her<br>  tell her that you will pay full price for the test.<br>  <br>  EDIT: you should of not had sex with her then just because you felt sorry for her. and that is the concenquences of sex if the child is yours|`|BIC5BlAHaa	petition the court for a DNA test. I think you are a stand up guy. you know there is a chance that you are a father and you are taking the responsibility like a man should. I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK AND GOD BLESS!!!|`|1dCWMzbraa	There have been crazier things that could happen... anyway. If she took the plan b pill (morning after.) You should be ok. as long yall ended on a good note- no reason for her to lie to you about it being someone elses.|`|50413e6060a85c241ba6435845a4cc2aaa	This is the consequence of having sex. That is why you should use protection. If you have sex again, use a condom, otherwise get ready to be a dad. <br>  <br>  That being said.... the only thing you can do, is demand a DNA test. But she is insisting you aren't the dad and she might not co-operate. But if you think it might be yours, and it could be because you had sex within two weeks of her and the other guy, get a lawyer and pursue getting a DNA test from her. If it is your child, you have paternal rights. <br>  <br>  Good luck. Im sorry you have to go through this. I would be worried too. |`|d8dec7383aba64c8eb7690aa6175958faa	Wow.. That is crazy. Good of you for wanting to know so bad.. :]<br>  But I would say there is definitely a chance.. But the only way you can really know is convincing her to do paternity test to put your mind to rest.. |`|yazSQ41Laa	It's not yours|`|jtnS02Vxaa	I don't know what state you are in but you can probably obtain a legal court order for a dna test it's ashame there aren't more men like you out there....good luck and research it on google |`|qzG0uQMJaa	This sounds like a legal question, and since I don't know what state you are in, since all states have different laws, then you should seek the advice of counsel.  In the State of California, for example (I am an attorney here - and I can only speak to California), you can file a paternity action and demand (and the court would force) that she/baby submit to a buchel swab DNA test.  Then, the reality is or may be, if the child is deemed yours through DNA (never sign anything unless it is virtually certain.e.g., 98-99% DNA certainty... but even then, even if the child was deemed yours, since she doesn't want to be with you or share her kid...there is always the potential that she might keep the child from you, then you'd get embroiled in an ongoing dramarama 18 year battle over custody, visitation and yes, child support (which can be extremely hefty, if unpaid can force your drivers/professional licenses suspended, and basically wreak havoc on the rest of your life.  If she says THE BABY  isn't yours...believe it.  It probably isn't. SHE WOULD KNOW... Trust me, she can garner $$ from child support if she pursues the right dad and zippo if she doesn't. SO....SHE KNOWS WHO DAD IS... So, on that note, stop worrying, stop putting your whozit in places it doesn't belong without protection and NEVER believe a girl that says she is using birth control!!! ALWAYS WEAR A CONDOM!!!!  Even when you marry, you should ask yourself, can I put up with this person's "funk moods" if she actually hated me...and we had kids together, meaning that a person must be responsible, reliable, mature and emotionally stable,  most of all - before you should even consider having a kid.  Having a child is the most incredibly wonderful and rewarding thing you could ever do, so don't ruin it by having to split the baby and force that poor child to bounce between households and split parents.  It stinks.  BE RESPONSIBLE...AND HAVE KIDS AT A MUCH LATER DATE....Enjoy your youth!  Run as far away from that girl and her baby as you can!!!|`|xmVGViPiaa	I do not think the baby is yours because she broke up with you 2+ weeks before the date of conception.  It is very possible that she just had someone else lined up right after she broke up with you.   I'd think she would tell you if the baby was yours - it sounds like she is confident that it is not.
GoWfIZ0gaa	Your first mornings pee is the pee you pee when you first wake up. So perfect for you. :)|`|6lyvhRLsaa	Go for it!|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Perfect time!  Post the results.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ahh darn!  You will get that possitive soon!!  Now get some sleep!|`|cd09ff87fa181897142ac9977c80c9fcaa	Please know that the test is not a 100% accurate but pretty close...<br>  <br>  and YES under the conditions you have mentioned the 1st pee even if before 5 am is good for the test. or the second pee will also show you similar results of your condition since the tests measure the amount of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (commonly abbreviated as hCG) in the woman’s urine. Different brands of tests are formulated for detecting different levels of hCG, meaning that some tests are accurate earlier in the woman’s cycle than other tests that are calibrated to detect higher levels of hCG. Thus, testing too early after conception may mean that the woman’s hCG level is not yet high enough to be detected by that particular test.<br>  <br>  Take the test but for 100% accuracy i would recommend visit your gynec / physician and getting a blood test to confirm your condition<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|AA10847776	Perfect time for it! GL! =)|`|es6l59Unaa	 i would say yes!!!!! when is the last time you went to the bathroom|`|20s7t80uaa	You just woke up, so go ahead and take it.<br>  It's what you're supposed to do, doesn't matter exactly what time it is.<br>  just as long as its the first time you've peed this morning.
1IDSGM71aa	I don't reccomend you try castor oil. I've heard that sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and either way it will give you the runs or something. The best ways I know of are sex and nipple stimulation. If you try nipple stimulation, be very careful! I've heard it can cause very strong, very long contractions. If you do decide to do it, rub one of your nipples for about five minutes and see what happens. Try that about once an hour, alternatig nipples, while still going about your usual routine. If after a day,or half a day if you're really anxious, it hasn't worked, try the nipple stimulation and sex together. If that doesn't work, your baby probably just isn't ready to come out yet, sorry. Good luck, be careful and congrats on the baby!|`|AA11102589	I heard stimulating your nipples is a way of self induction. Also drinking castor oil wil help.|`|5geiAsVKaa	Just tell your Doctor you would rather wait and try to do a natural labor.<br>  If you do need to be induced at the last minute , if there is complications , then tell them that would be ok. <br>  Go with your gut, it's your baby and your body!<br>  Doctors like induced, it fits into their schedule better. 
DYJOpfvraa	Hello-<br>  <br>  I tested this morning and got a BFP. I'm 3wks and 5days. My expected due date is June 17th 2009<br>  BTW, this baby is my second one. I'm so excited! Yay!<br>  Congrats to you!<br>  EDIT: So far I haven't had any symptoms. I'm hoping I don't get morning sickness. With my first I had 'all day sickness'.

CwUeQ5ERaa	Yes, a group of friends I had got into this crap with one girl (I just hung out with the group, 'cause I really didn't have nobody else, lol) and she spread a rumor about me. Well, there was one girl I hung out with, and as soon as junior high came around, she got where she rarely would ever speak to me, and then it got to where she wouldn't speak to me. At all.<br>  <br>  I also had a friend that I had since kindergarten, and we barely even speak anymore. I guess we grew apart, but I say that if your supposed "friends" are treating you like ****, then they're aren't real friends.<br>  <br>  Find someone else to be friends with, that treats you respectfully and someone who doesn't treat you bad. I had a few "friends" like that before, and trust me, I'm happy I don't hang-out with them anymore. It would probably be for the best if you were to break away from them.|`|HnqRAqtTaa	Yes, because they were two-faced douches and I was tired of their $hit. I'm glad I did. They're starting to loose all they're other friends now too. All they have left is the sluts who are just with them because "they're hot" and and the boys as selfish and self centered as they are. It's really funny actually.|`|PbFmWqzoaa	Yes, I did it once. Every time we go out, we end up unhappy. Every outing, she's lecturing me. She looks down on me. I don't want such a friend. I feel friends should be people you feel happy hanging around with. So I told her, "Let's not meet anymore." I feel bad, but still I feel this is what I should do.|`|EqHhsVVIaa	I have. I was sitting with the "Popular" girl group in my school. I was actually part of it. I enjoyed being with them. But after a while, I found out their true colours. Which I didn't like at all. They were mad and told me not to come "crying back to them``. The funny thing is, I never have. I found of that I was better then them. And didn`t enjoy seeing other people get hurt! Good for u for doing what was right! :)|`|q3yQFJ9naa	i had this happen to me. my best friend started dating this guy. she never made time for me cuz she was always with him and her friends. i didnt like who she was hanging out with so i went back to my other group of friends. this went on for a year. i still barely talk to her. she moved to FL over the summer. i thought maybe since her BF is going in the marines she might talk to me again. nope that didnt happen|`|TeunOsMyaa	yes last year my whole group. and because they treated me like **** and they said alot of stuff about me to people which made alot of people hate me. which they still do. but not i just dont talk to them anymore|`|273e527afee76a6be1d3b1e5404fa9aaaa	Well yeah!<br>  Its a long stupid story.<br>  <br>  Who could hold alcohol the most? its just stupid, we talk now but we are not as close as before.<br>  <br>  If they treat you bad give it right to their face, friends should respect friends.|`|hwWghZY8aa	allot..and i dont have anymore friends..i just have friendly people|`|0c330dc5c7e321c8e8dfd2f50ecea522aa	if theya re being taht ay you shouldn't be friends with them. You need firedns who aren;t so quick to jugde and male you feel good about yourself. Friends are omprtant but  they are not good if they treat you like dirt.|`|6eaWRGaqaa	I have many many times! My school is really small (55 girls), so I have pretty much been friends with all of them.<br>  <br>  In Lower School I was best friends with this group of girls who now think they are "all that". I ditched them because they were obsessed with each other and were always really rude. They always spoke their minds and were really dramatic.<br>  <br>  For 5th and 6th grade I went back to the people I was friends with in Kindergarten, 1st, and 2nd grade. They were really nice, but most of them were pretty immature and they always looked at me like a sl*t if I went out with a guy.<br>  <br>  In 7th grade I became friends with this girl who at first was really nice to me. Then she started making me feel bad about myself. There was a point I felt so bad about myself, she was my only friend (she had convinced me everyone else was mean) and I felt like such a loner. I mean, we always had fun together but it was little things like convincing myself to break up with my boyfriend or that I was really ugly.<br>  <br>  By the end of 7th grade I was back with the group I was with in 5th and 6th grade. Luckily they had all matured by then, so it was fine. Accept this time their group had expanded to the largest in the grade of 22 girls. I felt like I was never good enough to be their friend, but I tried anyway. Pretty soon they were excepting me like they always used to. Now they didn't make fun of me (as much) for making out with guys and whatever.<br>  <br>  In 8th grade the large clique pretty much divided into two groups. I was caught between the two. Some days I sit with one group, other days I sit with the other. We always sit sort of close together, but I am excepted in both cliques so it's all good :)<br>  <br>  -Catherine
AA11705978	Believe me, you can get pregnant at any time...I was 17 and using my period as birth control, (only having sex during my period, it was messy but neither me nor my bf wanted to conceive) a week before my 18th b-day I became pregnant.<br>  Make an appointment and speak with your gynecologist which contraceptive would be best for you, (there are several different kinds beside the pill) in the meantime, be safe and use a condom.|`|HclKftzAaa	there is never a guaranteed 'safe' time to have unprotected sex. you will always risk pregnancy if you have unprotected sex.<br>  <br>  While it is true that ovulation tends to occur at the same time in a woman's cycle, it is also true that every woman is different. So you're 'normal' ovulation time could be different to mine, for eg. Also, a woman is not guaranteed to ovulate at the same time each cycle. For eg, you may ovulate 10 days after your period starts, or your cycle could go a bit longer, and you might ovulate 17 days after your period starts. you can never tell.<br>  <br>  Further more, sperm can hang around in the vagina for 7 days!!! True, it's usually only 3-4 days, but it CAN survive for longer. So, even if you have sex during your period, there is no guarantee that there won't still be sperm alive by the time you drop your egg. <br>  <br>  Heck, some women even drop their egg DURING their period. There's just no way to be sure.|`|yJXX9kLqaa	The best thing to do is learn your cycles then you will have a better idea of when you ovulate and don't have unprotected sex for 5-7 days before you ovulate and again not for 2-3 days after you ovulate. But there is always a chance.|`|sxmQSpagaa	You can get pregnant anytime you have sex, regardless of day of cycle if you do not use contraceptives. You are risking it and need to be responsible about having sex if you don't want to have a baby. You can't have your cake and eat it, too. |`|wwdW2Jqiaa	THEN WHO WAS PHONE????|`|xBW4saqgaa	dont have sex then you wont get pregnant|`|nWeGufPSaa	It will be better to ask such complicated questions to a doctor & when you do not know the answer how you will judge that which answer is correct & which is the best one  Any how<br>  <br>  Take a case that the period of a women as per chart mainly of 28 days to 30 days In exceptional case or due to some disease it can very from 15 days to 40 days but it will not be considered as a normal period days.<br>  Now you require that,Most NONFERTILE  period in a women monthly chart:-<br>  take the case of a thirty days period ie. ...........if we assume that your period starts on 1st march and ends on 5th march then the next TEN days i.e. up to 15th March (5 to 15 march) are the most safe days as NON FERTILISED period after that for next five days up to 20th March i.e. 15th to 20 th March is the Most FERTILE period in a women monthly chart. As a precaution it can be extended for two days more i.e. 14th march to 21st march because egg & sperm can survive for 12 hours as an precaution we should avoid these days when we do not want pregnancy<br>  If we desire pregnancy 15th march to 20th march is BEST PERIOD for FERTILISATION and after intercourse a lady should lye in straight position calmly for at least half an hour. <br>  Now the days 20th march to 30 March is again NON FERTILISED period and repeatedly so on every month.<br>  If your period is of 27 days or 28 days calcuate the opposite days to period. Lower down the ten days to nine or eight or seven as required in both sides. If you can calculate the exact time & date between two periods you can more accurate in calculating the Most fertile period in a women monthly chart according to minutes. Now you can choose the right time not to be pregent. <br>  As an exceptional case there can be any thing a pregency can happen at any time not for all ladied but in any exceptional case (about 1% ) as exceptional lady. There was a chance in UK & this is scientic fact that a lady became pregent without mating with a man during second world war|`|pjnnTTJsaa	With out the pill and protection, there really isn't a safe time.

Just tell her to make sure she's eating right for all that activity, as being pregnant requires more and better nutrition.  As for the job, you may want to get one, better paying job, full-time, so you can have benefits for your family.

At least until your income gets better and you can move out.<br>  <br>  Also, she can probably keep her job and school schedule - but she should be careful.  Stress may not induce a miscarriage but it can have effects on her pregnancy and your baby.  Try to help her so that she does not get too stressed out - meaning, make her time at home as less stressful as possible.  If she finds the work load to be too much (pregnancy can wear your body down and make you TIRED) then she should probably cut back where she can.<br>  <br>  I know towards the end of my pregnancy (I am 29 weeks now so in my 3rd trimester) I am VERY TIRED, I take 1 or 2 naps a day and sleep 12 hour nights most nights.  She needs to get her rest and needs to allow for any symptoms she might have that are not anticipated (sickness and fatigue, which can kill your schedule).<br>  <br>  Most of all being the father, I would just help her out and do whatever it takes to make her comfortable.  Support her emotionally and let her come to you for help, vents, etc -- it really does help A LOT to know your husband/boyfriend is there for you during pregnancy!|`|keGJGAkhaa	Here is the web site I go to... it also has a section "for dad" my boyfriend reads it :) ...

Although these findings are interesting, the many causes of elevated cortisol levels make this association very tenuous as evidence of cause. <br>  <br>  More than 15 percent of documented pregnancies end in miscarriage. The vast majority of early miscarriages are caused by fetal chromosomal abnormalities or other errors in the development of the embryo. Rare causes of repeated miscarriage include blood-clotting problems, abnormalities of the uterus or cervix, hormone imbalances and immune responses that disrupt implantation. <br>  <br>  Some stress during pregnancy is inevitable. No one can avoid stress completely. Although excessive or prolonged stress isn't good for you, it is unlikely that stress in itself causes early miscarriage.|`|aDKXx6bBaa	the best thing you can do is be supportive to your girlfriend and stay in college. The first 4 years wont be as expensive as the ones that follow. Lean on your parents right now and live with them. Finishing school and having a solid education and job skills to lean on will make you feel good about yourself and able to provide for your family. Your child will grow up to respect you. If she has love and support in her life stress from school could hardly have a big impact. The biggest stress is when the babies father abandons you during pregnancy or family issues.
c9387f79b14133134f45bd7ea7546614aa	Ok I was the same way as you..mainly because my mom was VERY sick with her pregnancies and I've been hearing how horrible it was all my life.<br>  <br>  True..some people don't get sick at all.  For me... unlike my mom.... I only actually puked 3 times.  I have the wrist bands too..only I never used them.   I even went on a cruise while I was feeling sick!! <br>  <br>  For me the nice thing when I did get sick is that I'd puke and feel pretty good afterward. For me it wasn't like having the flu where you still feel like crap after you vomit.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is take 1 day at a time... assume you will be fine. If you start to feel sick...keep a bag with you at all times...along with some snacks that might help settle your stomach.      Try buying ginger cookies... ginger is supposed to help block the nausea and it really helped me.<br>  <br>  One of the worst parts of morning sickness is smells. It's like you have super smelling. We had to change to non smelling soap and detergent.<br>  <br>  The good thing is..if you do get sick (which you might not) it might be very mild and there are things you can do to help.  Also most likely you'll feel better after 3-4 months. <br>  <br>  I'm now almost 7 months pregnant and I can eat anything..I'm hungry and feeling great.  Just hang in there. It probably won't be as bad as you think and you'll get through it by taking it one step at a time.|`|YGDoQbs1aa	Well, I must say I wasn't one of the over 70%. I never vomited. I did have nausea though. I found that if I kept some crackers and sprite by the bed and ate a few before I got up the nausea would be significantly less. I found the more carbohydrates I ate during the day helped as well. Fruits are good too for nausea. Good luck and try not to stress about it because that will make things much worse!|`|TlFnIei0aa	Some peple don't get it but I'm six months and still do. I got it bad, it was more like all day and all nigh sicness. I'm just used to it now, i get on with things and stop to have a spew and then keep going.|`|dafae2ae3b86a68e315dfbc92b268dc5aa	It  is  only  unpleasant ,  not  life  threatening .<br>  You  are  Not  going  to  die  so  the  "scared  to  death"  is  kinda  drama  queen .<br>  Too  much drama  and ,  well  you  remember  the  story  of  the boy  who  cried  wolf  too  often ?<br>  People  will  just  start  ignoring  you ,  then  when  something  real  scary  does  happen ,<br>  NO  One  will  pay  attention to you .<br>  <br>  Chill  on  the  drama  queen  and <br>  <br>  What  they  should  have  warned  you  of  was ,<br>  You  are   going  to  spend  years  of  your  life , <br>  Changing  thousands  of  diapers .<br>  <br>  Now  THAT  is  Scary  !<br>  <br>  >|`|zAGCfdquaa	I had an extreme fear of vomiting also, and I was blessed with VERY little morning sickness. But during my first pregnancy, I got over the fear very quickly, almost instantly.|`|A1IisrUraa	dont worry about it alot of people dont even get morning sickness my cousin has had four kids and has never had morning sickness!! |`|OIAtKsQ0aa	Yes I HATED morning sickness!!!!!! I was the unusual one who had it like almost all dam* day some days. But no you wont get USED TO IT, you'll just be able to deal with it after a few weeks. ( in your case it might last longer than that or not even that long)  Like before you even get out of bed in the morning eat a few saltine crakers, dont even MOVE your body before you get those in your belly.  My husband got outta bed to get them for me. Seriously, for me that was the only thing that helped to make me feel better..<br>  OH and dont worry because you prolly wont actually puke all the time, I didnt. I just felt like i was going to puke all the time. I mean sometimes i did but there wasnt anything in there so it didnt last very long.. And dont trip about it, cuz there are alot more Horrifying things about being pregnant than having morning sickness!!! <br>  Good luck!!! |`|xmVGViPiaa	I have a phobia with vomiting as well, but I had vomiting by 4 weeks p-conception.<br>  I didn't throw up every day, more like every other day or every 2 days.  It just becomes routine and though it's still not comfortable you just have to get over that fear and realize you are doing this for a wonderful prize.  I know that doesn't ALWAYS help but it can help you when you start to feel like giving up.  Believe me, I had my days and still do - but I think about the moment I will be holding my baby, the moment I will be able to say that I DID IT, and all of the relief and happiness I will feel at that moment... And my regrets all go away.<br>  <br>  It can make you miserable and make you wish you never got pregnant, BUT you don't have to feel that way.  <br>  Not all women get vomiting, and not all women get nausea.  Some are lucky and get none of that.  Others just get nausea and no vomiting.  Regardless it's best if you keep food in your tummy at all times (just a little and light), drink cold water, and keep well rested.  Sea bands might help you if you start to feel sick.<br>  Just try to relax - good luck and congratulations!  :)|`|0JV3tQm8aa	You may be able to alleviate nausea by keeping some<br>  food in your stomach — by avoiding having a stomach that’s completely empty or completely full. Here are some other dietary<br>  <br>  suggestions for preventing or relieving nausea:<br>  <br>  Eat smaller meals or snacks frequently throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Have a small snack at bedtime and when you get up to go to the bathroom at night.<br>  <br>  Avoid foods and smells that trigger nausea.<br>  <br>  Drink fewer fluids with your meals.<br>  <br>  Generally morning sickness is not dangerous.But if you get dehydrated,it may affect your baby.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps|`|nbSp469Waa	You could be that 30% that doesn't get sick.  I only threw up once with my first pregnancy and that was because the smell of McDonald's made me do it, and I only had nausea for about a week.  With my 2nd pregnancy, my toothpaste made me throw up, until I switched toothpastes, other than that I had no nausea, and with my 3rd I never threw up, had very little nausea.
AA11784984	You can only take tylenol. Stop taking anything else until you talk to a doctor. They can tell you any other medication you can take.|`|ioZeveazaa	I agree with the other replier. You really should talk to your doctor first before taking anything however tylenol is ok to take for your headaches. Use vicks rub under your nose to help you breath and drink some tea to soothe your throat and keep you warm. Good luck!|`|Xc02z608aa	You shouldn't really be taking ANYTHING without the approval of your doctor! <br>  Lemon water helps for sore throats<br>  tea with honey<br>  <br>  you can take Tylenol as it does NOT pass through the blood stream to the baby but IB PROPHEN or anything else is a strict NO!  Tums are also safe.  <br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor before you start medicating next time.  Just cuz it doesn't say anything bad doesn't mean that its good.|`|L42LJ1P4aa	Children's cough medicine doesn't say not to use if you're pregnant because it is intended for child's use and children don't normally get pregnant. You can use Robitussin. In the site listed in my sources, they have a list of meds you can take during pregnancy. I took Robitussin for my cold and it worked very well. You have to buy the regular one though, not multi-symptom. |`|Kq5Y1NaEaa	Well number one don't buy into the pc bs about your body rejecting something that is wrong. My sister was sick/morning and afternoon, poor girl for the first 6months of her pregnancy, and my nephew is the most perfect boy in the world......<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just deal with it, grit your teeth and bear it what ever. Just think about what you have to gain|`|xmVGViPiaa	You can take plain Robitussin and you can take Mucinex.  You can take Tylenol (plain or extra strength but no more than 2000mg a day) for headaches.|`|rsEK17n1aa	is best that you don't take anything the 1st trimester the 1st 3 months are very critical, I know how you feel I went through the samething with all my pregnancies I had a cold like 4 times throught out my pregnancy and headaches were terrible I will just put a cold towel in my head.  but after your 1st trimester you can take tylenol for headaches.  I never took anything for my cold I made my own remedy honey with lemon.|`|Hf9snNyzaa	Tylenol is the only thing most women will tell you to take... cough syrups dont sound like a good idea... When i was three months pregnant I was diagnosed with mono!

It is like it is never ending. |`|582087d67f10400091e1b22b3761b0f3aa	trust me, you will know. You constantly feel like you are going to throw up. |`|PuuFMRcFaa	Sometimes it can be mild and flu like or sometimes it can be like the flu on steroids. Depending on how your body responds to fluctuating hormones you could have only mild nausea first thing in the morning or the works all day with nausea, vomiting, food aversions, dizziness, headaches, body aches.  When it is morning sickness...usually mommy's intuition kicks in too and you just "know" it is the real thing and not just feeling under the weather.   |`|i7EYX1Sjaa	First off it is different every time. LOL trust me I know. The first time around I would wake up and immediately have to run to the toilet. It didn't matter what I did I was sick immediately. Usually would get sick a few times in the early to mid day and then just feel like I was about to be sick the rest of the day. For me that lasted until 7 months along and that was with my son.<br>  With my daughter I was still puking quite a bit but instead of a sudden uncontrollable purge she was more a nasty feeling in the back of your throat and in the deep belly that you just know it's a matter of time. It ended by 5 months with her but it was worse. With my son once i puked I felt better until the next round started. With my little girl I was constantly sick to my stomach, there was never any relief from it until the doctor put me on meds since I was loosing to much weight.<br>  FYI Speak with women in your family since the intensity of morning sickness tends to follow family history. Everyone in my family always got extreme morning sickness. Other women might get a bit sick to their stomach every so often and thats it. One way to know for sure is walk by some strong smells. Popcorn always did me in, I couldn't go near it. Things like cigarette smoke, any alcohol, garlic, french fries, any red meat cooking. All of those would send me running to the bathroom.<br>  Trust me when I say it doesn't feel like a stomach flu or food poisoning. It's different even if it has the same "symptoms"|`|xmVGViPiaa	When I had morning sickness I was very weak and tired.  I felt like I had run for miles.  I would sweat all over my body and my heart would start to pound.  My stomach would feel as if it was filled with fluid and I just knew at that point that I was going to throw up.  Throwing up didn't make me feel better either, I would be nauseous all day and feeling like at any second I would need to race to a bathroom.<br>  It went away when I hit 20 weeks... At least the vomiting did - I still get nauseous all the time.|`|M7jahqoNaa	Trust me, you will know as soon as it hits... Every morning while I was brushing my teeth I would have to throw up (EVERY time).  And a whole lot of smells upset my stomach like perfume I could smell from a block away. And in order to keep my stomach from churning from the smells I would have to eat snacks throughout the day.  Its a horrible and uncomfortable feeling.|`|bFbSXNx8aa	Its different in everyone... but for me it was like I constantly was carsick, just felt queasy all the time and no food appealed to me.  And every morning and right before bed (when I was really tired) I would get a surge of nausea and throw up.  Fun fun!|`|hQuVakVjaa	throwing up or nauseous! <br>  and it doesn't just happen in the morning, sometimes it happens all day!

jsdDgIuRaa	my son used to spit up a ton and it had nothing to do with overfeeding him he would spit up regardless of how much he ate.<br>  <br>  they say the spitting up peaks around 4 months and gets better after that.  my son pretty much stopped spitting up by about 5.5 months or, now he never spits up.  <br>  <br>  the baby will grow out of it and as long as he does not seem upset by the spitting up and is gaining weight it is totally normal|`|LwUBqT3Paa	Your husband couldn't be more wrong. Baby needs to nurse when baby wants to nurse for so many reasons -- for feeding, of course, but also for comfort, and to keep your milk supply at the level he needs. Restricting access to the breast is a recipe for breastfeeding failure; your husband needs to STFU.<br>  <br>  Spitting up is normal. Breastfed babies eat frequently. These sorts of things should be easy for your husband to Google and find out for himself.|`|Zx8uw3I2aa	try him with a little bit of cooled boiled water<br>  my son sometimes acts like hes hungry, drinks milk for about 10 seconds then gets upset, so then i give him some water and he happily drinks it. although he didnt like water at first, hes used to it now :)<br>  but remember, all babies are different, dont take my word that this will work, seeing as thomas [my son] is on a little it of rusk now which makes them more thirsty...<br>  <br>  im sorry i couldnt be of more help.<br>  do what you think is best for your baby<br>  <br>  xxx|`|AA10949064	Babies know right from the beginning when they are full, and when they are hungry.<br>  <br>  My suggestion, try burping him more.  He sounds like he's gasie.|`|Uh89njc7aa	Most likely he just needs to burp.  We burp our 4 month old after he drinks about 3oz (out of a 6oz feeding).  If no burp after about 2 - 3 minutes, we feed him another ounce and try to burp him again?  Sometimes there is a little bit of spit up when he does burp, but that is normal. <br>  <br>  If he still spits up a lot, even after normal burping, take him in because he may have acid reflux.  Although there is not much that can be done for this except wait until your baby develops more, its good for the doctor to see him.|`|85PmFNp3aa	Babies throw up a lot!! Both of my children started  doing this right around the same age (both breastfed)- at first it really scared me, but no.. it's pretty normal, I think it's just them adjusting their appetite/calorie intake. Anyway, if your baby's hungry, feed him. Alot of times it's just a burp that's trapped behind the milk, sometimes my babies would eat ALOT more after spitting up like that, because they had just emptied so much of their stomach contents, that they needed a refill. Tell your husband to chill out, let your baby give you the cues, he knows if he's hungry or not.|`|auNUWQo7aa	If he's hungry...feed him...Spit up does not always mean they are full. Sometimes it just means they have a sensitive tummy. Perhaps a little more burping could help. My baby is 14 months old and still spits up occasionally. Doesn't mean he ate too much.<br>  <br>  You may also consider the thought that perhaps you are being used as a human pacifier. Have you ever tried to give him a paci? Not saying that would be the right or wrong thing to do, its up to you, but perhaps he is just wanting some suckling comfort and he is using you to do that. <br>  <br>  Your the momma, you know what is best for him better than we, or even your husband for that matter do. Do what you think is right.<br>  |`|AA10389891	i am breastfeeding my son also. when he is done eating he will not take the nipple or if he does its like for 2 seconds. then spits it out.  if he is still fussing make sure his diaper is dry and nothing is scratching him. make sure to burp him good. one burp int necessarily all he is going to do so keep patting babys back for a few more mins to see if any little ones come out. hope i helped|`|204f2f141e3ee50b3481fba8e0ce40b9aa	If it's a lot of spit up (more than 2 tbl spoons) then a doctor should look at him but he probably has acid reflux.  You can get baby sized Prevacid and others it will help a little.  He could also be lactose intolerant, try a different formula.<br>  <br>  All babies spit up.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	are you making sure to burp him enough? it could be the type of formula you are using but i doubt its because he is full if he is still crying for more and not pulling away.|`|iyRWN59Xaa	Hubby needs a chill pill.  Babies spit up A LOT.  If baby is hungry, then by all means continue to feed.|`|2451MT2Haa	He is spitting up because he needs to be burped, thats all...I burp the baby until i get 1 good burp and 2 okay ones... some time i stop feeding to get a burp so their bellies dont overfill with milk and air and has room for milk. No worries. Just feed your baby when he is hungry, you are being a good mother. Tell your husband that he just has gas, and he shouldnt be mad. Trust me, spitting up is part of baby life.<br>  <br>  Does he seem like the spitting up is bothering him?? i ask this because the baby i nannied for had a reflux problem, he was also breastfed, we only figured it out because it seemed to bother him when he spit up. We had to pump and use Dr. Browns bottles and Reflux drops. Im not sure, but if you dont think it is gas, and it is still a worry, dont be afraid to ask your doctor at his check up or sooner. Good Luck!|`|xbq4hGJdaa	The spit up is most likely caused from the baby trying to burp on his own and sometimes some formula comes out with the burp! If he was full then he wouldn't let you put the bottle in his mouth any more! My 4 month old son does the same thing!|`|VI9QHJgsaa	Aw your not a bad mother your just worried about your son.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Is the spit up fresh?  Or sour?  If it's fresh, your husband is right that the baby has not sensed that he is full just yet, so he's demanding more.  If it's sour, it's more of a reflux problem.<br>  <br>  When my daughter was 4 months, the dr. had me start her on rice cereal with a sprinkle of sugar in it mixed with formula.  It was really fun trying to teach her how to open her mouth for the spoon, but soon she got a hang of it, and I did, too.<br>  <br>  The point is if you were to give him half of his bottle, that way he's not hysterically hungry, and then feed him a little bit of cereal, then offer a little bit of bottle to finish up, the cereal might make him feel fuller sooner, so that he might not even finish the last half of his bottle, and no spit up, either.<br>  <br>  You're not a bad mother.  You're feeding the baby on demand, and that's what you should be doing.  You're right, too, that baby doesn't know when he's full.  So you let him determine when he is done, and if he spills some out, well, that's the price of selling tea in China!<br>  <br>  If your husband doesn't want him to be fed anymore, hand the screaming baby over to daddy and say, here you go dad.  You take care of the baby until he realizes he's not hungry any more.<br>  <br>  TX Mom<br>  |`|MIqJRlzAaa	Has he always spit up?  If so, he may have gastric reflux.  Two of my nephews had that.  They spit up each time they ate until they were several months old.  It's not uncommon, and as long as he's gaining weight, he'll be fine.  <br>  <br>  However, if he just now starting spitting up each time he eats, I would ask his pediatrician about it.  I don't know if they can develop a reflux at four months when they haven't always had it.  <br>  <br>  Like you said, he pulls away when he's done.  You are a good mother. I would call a pediatrician and double-check to appease your husband.   :)
7AyyBuSCaa	I started my period 1 month after giving birth even though I was strictly breastfeeding (yaaay, I didn't even get THAT little perk :P), had it TO THE DAY every month after until 5 months in- then *poof*.  I haven't had it for 2 months. <br>  <br>  And nope, I'm not pregnant.  <br>  <br>  I have no idea if we're normal or not, but know there's another oddity schlepping around out there. :D  |`|PQop22Tuaa	i only breast feed and had one period and then after this have not had one for 5 months and i am definatly not pregnant done millions of tests and nothing. the doctor explained it can be because i am breastfeeding which lowers your LH hormone and your FSH hormone both of these are whats needed for ovulation.. which can cause your period to stop/slow down... do a test if your not sure, but i have herd this and experienced it myself.<br>  once you stop feeding or start to introduce solids you will find that your period may return!!|`|kxSz1PYmaa	I breastfed my daughter for 9 months and had the 1st cycle and then not another one until she was weened.  Take a pregnancy test for peace of mind, but I wouldn't worry about not having started while breastfeeding.|`|l0nihePAaa	mine have been spaced every 5-6 weeks instead of the usual 28-30 days, started back at 3 1/2 months and now at 6 months. |`|pqhJvzO1aa	In breastfeeding books and other material I have read it says that it is normal to not have your period while you are breastfeeding. So I think I would be normal. Some women who breastfeed do not have regular periods. If you are worried about being pregnant then that a test, but otherwise I wouldn't worry about it. Breastfeeding in itself has some birth control capabilities, but you can still get pregnant while breastfeeding. I am due any day now, and I have been reading up. Every person is different though so I am sure it is normal. Hope this helps.|`|wlEtGs0Maa	Yes.  Your hormones are all over the place.  They say that your period doesn't come for a while when you're breastfeeding... mine came just a few weeks later.  It would come and go as it pleased.... sometimes crazy heavy sometimes barely there.  My daughter is six months old now and it's still all over the place.  Very annoying.  Dr. assures me that it's normal, oh and don't freak if your hair starts to fall out a little more than usual either... all part of the hormonal process.  I only mention it because I notice it starting to happen shortly after my period came....  Apparently there is birth control pills available that are safe for breastfeeding if you really want a regular period back.|`|YfI2iM9iaa	Yes, that is TOTALLY normal! No worries.|`|7QjlDvs6aa	it is possible that you are pregnant  or your body maybe just getting back to normal anything is possible I am breasfeeding also but my son is 8mths old and I have had my period back for at least 6mths an i havnt had a period since sept aswell. I have been feeling different eating more etc and have had a neg test so going to doctor next week just to be sure,  I tihink that you should take a test and if it is neg go to the doctors Good luck hope you get the answer you want.|`|L8peUnIPaa	Yeah that can happen, although it is more likely if you are not exclusively BF'ing. Take a test to be sure you aren't pregnant, but this can happen & you not be preggo<br>  OB/GYN RN & mom
mT162V5Raa	Yes she can, the baby is fine, the same thing happened to me while I was 6 months pregnant, I had a fever and bad cough, I ended up dehydrated, because I wasn't able to keep anything down, so actually ending up in the hospital was better for the baby, your wife and baby need to stay hydrated as well.  All is fine, no need to worry about the baby. |`|aLAmvX5Naa	The baby will take and take from your wife's body until nothing is left. The only person who runs a risk is your wife. Your baby is fine and fed. No worries.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Baby will be fine.  Presumably in a few days your wife will be better, and able to eat real food.  (Think about all the women with severe morning sickness who eat little/nothing for weeks at a time.)|`|3Hm5eJfVaa	Since it's just the flu they will be fine. Baby will take from your wife until nothing is left. An IV is efficient. And thank goodness the flu is usually short lived. Try not to worry too much daddy. She is in the hospital for a reason and they will monitor her and baby very closely. Hope she feels better soon.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	Yes that will work, your wife's body stores vital nutrients all over its body in case of emergencies like this. The IV fluids are keeping her hydrated and allowing time for her stomach to rest. She will be able to get again in a day or two.|`|Ylrc1hkXaa	As long as it is the right stuff in the IV<br>  <br>  I had a friend in hospital who starved for 4 days over the bank holiday because the nurse incorrectly gave her saline and no glucose.
B9lNQxRlaa	LOL - I definatley think you should go for it what a beautiful name, she will be the most popular kid in school with a name like that, but I do agree Anus may be a nicer way to spell it.  Also Anus Socking sounds really nice together.  You should also give her a middle name that starts with S, what could be nicer than having the initals A.S.S. for a name.|`|fUjsE0LRaa	i have to agree with the other answers. <br>  I do beleive that your daughter will be teased at school. Kids are cruel, it is an unushual name.<br>  <br>  If you want to stick with tradition, perhaps keep the name but use it as a middle name, or have 2 middle names.

mz8iilAsaa	Clementine Rose Lehman is so girly and independent! Also flows well and sound beautiful!|`|EIgmm8ilaa	I'd go with Adelaide, I'm really not too fond of either of these names although I think there will be much less teasing on your daughter.<br>  <br>  Similar names that I like are Constantine (Connie) and Adalee/ Adaleigh.<br>  <br>  Congrats & good luck with your decision.|`|faPKwClPaa	NOT Clementine.  Adelaide is better, I guess, but both seem super old-fashioned and names for 80 year old women.  Are there ANY other names you could consider?

Clementine and Adelaide were actually two names on my girl list (my husband vetoed them lol).  People here in America might tease with the name Clementine, but it is gaining popularity.  Adelaide is really pretty, but she might get called Addie for short like all the Addisons and it could get confused with the enormous amount of Maddies.  Either way, I like your choice.|`|KsssaI8taa	They both sound like classy elegant names, I personally like Adelaide Rose better but they are both beautiful names.<br>  <br>  |`|dXMdt3gVaa	Definitely Adelaide and not Clementine.

1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	well, the doc is only 98% sure.<br>  be happy that the baby is healthy, thats the main thing.<br>  plus boys today love the colour pink.You should add some blue and yellow to the decorations.<br>  |`|CMuL7XpKaa	Return what you can, what you can't save for a later baby|`|AA10325228	take back the stuff you can take back, and keep the personalized things because maybe your sister will have a girl later and use the same name.|`|33O7ZTRRaa	My suggestion is to go back and exchange whatever you can.  Most places will let you exchange items even if you don't have the receipt.  For the things that are personalized or that can't be taken back, you can either always save them in case she has a girl in the future or you could always donate them (it would definitely help someone less fortunate).  In your case, I may hang onto them because what if they are wrong.  Ultrasounds are never 100%.  (They usually aren't wrong about boys as its either there or its not) You could try and do neutral colors for her shower (yellows, oranges, greens, etc...)<br>  I'm sure it's frustrating since you already made arrangements for the shower and everything.  Sadly, you never know 100% until the baby is born.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|9CAXUgOZaa	oh lol. <br>  I thought you'd had a sex change and wanted a new name. <br>  Don't I feel stupid.. <br>  <br>  <br>  That sucks..

jNtkhOTVaa	     My husband and I both knew we were ready to have our son because we were settled in life.  We didn't have a desire to be out at bars or parties.  We were ready to just settle down and we both had a deep desire to have a baby.<br>  <br>       We're not financially set.  It's hard to accomplish in this day and age and for a lot of people if they waited for that they'd never get to have a child.  <br>  <br>       It's nice to be able to provide the very best for your children.  I can't buy him the world.  But I am a stay at home mom who loves her baby boy more than anything in the world.  That's all that matters. <br>  <br>       But it does turn your life upside down.  There is never any time for anything but feedings, changings, and hopefully some sleep in there somewhere.  While the idea seemed scary when he wasn't here yet...  it's not a chore to take care of someone you love.  Even when you're running on empty and he's up again at 3 AM after eating only two hours ago.|`|LfopZ7wVaa	no one is ever 100% ready for kids, just make sure ur financially ready and then u have done the things u wanna do in life so u can spend ur time enjoying ur new motherhood life.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Me4kGy3Baa	i waited until i graduated university with my science degree.  that helped me to land the full time job i am in now.  i traded in my truck for a car.  i have loads of money now.  i took a couple vacations.  i have a nice bf, who i'll marry one day.   i don't have my own place, we live with my parents, but in a native culture that's pretty common, so we're happy where we are.<br>  <br>  i went to see my doc. and asked if she can check my charts if it'll be ok for me to try to have a baby ( i had endometriosis a couple years before) because another doctor said i'll never have babies.  She said, everything looked fine, and to go for it.  i got off my pill that day, talked with the bf, told him, i want a baby. he was like Sure! so 7 months later, i found out i was pregnant.<br>  <br>  i just really waited until i grew up, and i am glad i did.  i was 26 when i got pregnant and had her.  i'm 27 now, my bf is 38.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	I don't think you ever really KNOW you're ready.  But, you should BOTH have a desire to have a child and to raise him or her doing whatever it takes to make sure that that child has the best life you can possibly offer him/her.  You should be ready to work however many hours it takes to make ends meet, put someone else's needs before your own, loose sleep, loose your hair/go gray, loose your freedom to do things at the drop of a hat, and loose your mind.  And that's just the beginning.|`|OxFV92hJaa	Once we'd established a good life plan. <br>  Once we were financially able to have me be an at home mom.<br>  Once we'd picked a place to raise our family.<br>  Once we were ready to buy a home.<br>  Once we were finished doing our "hanging out", and were ready to live life at home as a family. <br>  <br>  Thats the short list of important things (to us) that we made sure to do first. |`|AA11078158	We had been married for 4.5 years when we had our first miscarriage--we had waited until we worked out most of our marriage problems to even consider trying, and even then I still wasn't sure.  But being so distraught over the miscarriage reassured me that it was time.  Now  we have a beautiful 5 week old daughter!|`|QM6wiVtVaa	I still have times when I get really freaked out and scared and think "I'm so not ready to be a mom!" and other days I just can't wait for my son to be here.<br>  |`|PoAiGIUDaa	My husband and I have always wanted kids, but I knew we were ready when we were financially stable enough to provide for the baby.
OXSOch9Oaa	Tell her you'd like to wait if it's safe.  It all depends on the size of your baby.  I had induced labor and wouldn't recommend it.  They didn't know my son was stuck which ended in a c-section, but in my case it would probably have ended no differently even if I  had gone into labor.  My mother went through labor and my brother was also stuck.  However, plenty of women have sucess with induced labor.  Just don't let them give you pitocin.  There are now other ways to induce that are more natural and less painful.  Most doctors won't let you go over 42 weeks as it becomes unsafe for you and baby.  Best of luck!|`|mkveZfqOaa	Tell her just that..what you told us.  But I was induced with both my pregnancies and didn't have a c-section either time.|`|61fDnK1Oaa	the only reason you should be induced is for health reasons. If the baby is under stress or if you're at risk in any way then that's the ONLY reason to do it. If you and the baby are healthy then you should wait for it naturally to happen but you shouldn't go over 42 weeks. You just need to tell her straight out that you want it to happen naturally and you don't want to be induced. Ask her why you're being induced and unless there is a good reason then tell her no. Good luck! |`|wnxOXBuKaa	No, No, No, NO..... A doctor WILL induce you WITHOUT good reasoning... They do it on their schedule, not yours. <br>  <br>  Tell her straight up that you want to have this baby on the babies schedule..not hers. <br>  <br>  If she isn't okay with that, then I would make peace with another doctor delivering your baby. Don't go against your instincts. <br>  <br>  <br>  The easiest way to tell her no is tell her that you do not want to be induced unless it is life threatening to you or the baby...she has *no* right to force you into an induction. <br>  |`|L8peUnIPaa	Tell her you would like to try to go natural, but be aware that there is such a thing as too overdue & this too can increase risk to baby's well being, so if you went more than a week past your due date, you're probably going to have to have an induction.  Start walking a lot, sex, sex, sex, & clean that house. LOL Maybe you can jump start that labor. Good Luck<br>  OB/GYN RN & mom|`|frpCK0utaa	Your doctor is probably inducing you for a good reason, and it not safe to want to go against that. Besides you still have a week or so to go, you could still go naturally.<br>  She wouldn't want to induce if there wasnt a damn good reason.|`|xmVGViPiaa	Tell her exactly what you just told us -- that you want to go into labor naturally.  But also keep in mind your Dr will and should induce you if there is a risk to you or your baby if the pregnancy continues much further.  Tell her if there is no risk to the baby or yourself, that you would prefer to have a natural birth with no induction.  |`|07vAXzqTaa	Just tell ur doctor u don't want to induce ur labor only if u really have too . I had to induce my labor cuz my daugther was already 5 days late lol so they had to induce me cuz It was getting dangers 4 the baby the baby  could choke on the core n die. That's y sumtimes is nessesery to do it . If u n ur baby r in no danger don't do it is really painful |`|f4f5K93Raa	You don't have to do anything you don't want to. If you don't want to be induced just simply decline it. |`|vRQaON5Uaa	you should have the choice unless other wise medically. its your body your baby. Most times with your 1st pregnancy you tend to go over due anyways.....|`|AjX1cpAXaa	I have been in exactly this situation.  Luckily my midwife was on my side.  After two inductions I was determined not to have one with my last baby.  You have to be strong and clear and determined.  As long as there is no medical reason to be induced then going over your due date will not harm the baby.  I went over nearly three weeks, which is the absolute limit.  I was due for induction that day.  So what did I do? I had to agree to go to the large hospital nearby once a week to have the fetal monitor put on and my midwife checked me twice on top of that per week.  But I had to find the strength to stand up for myself and what I wanted which is not easy in the face of the medical profession but it can be done.  Talk it through with your husband/partner/birth partner so that they understand how strongly you feel about this and ask them to accompany you to your next appointment to support you.<br>  <br>  FYI I had a safe, 'easy', quick and wonderful delivery ... at home!<br>  <br>  I really really hope that you get what you want as long as it is safe for you and your little one.<br>  <br>  Good luck and very best wishes x|`|Q78l2vtsaa	ok let me tell you what happened to me with my 1st baby and why I think you should do this... I was 1 week over due and was persuaded by my doctor to be induced and that there would be no problems, well my baby was not down far enough so he broke my water to get her to come down and it did not work so since he broke my water and she didn't come I had a C-section and 2 more after that because most doctor's don't want to chance a V-back now adays for fear of tearing. So what I think you should do I get another opinion from at least 2 more doctors.. That is the great thing about this country plenty of OB's around and you have the right to see any of them!!! Then afterwords Make your OWN decision and do it!!! Don't always listen to a doctor they are not always right... and you will soon see when your little one gets here what I mean...
AjX1cpAXaa	You are already 95% of the way to doing what our wife needs - knowing that this is going to be difficult if the news is bad - for you too.<br>  <br>  My advice - from personal experience - don't talk about having another baby unless she starts to talk about it.  The urge to look to the future when everything will be ok again will be strong - but it can make it feel as though you are saying "OK that didn't work out, never mind, let's think about trying again".  I know that is not what you would mean it is how your wife would take it.  If the worst has happened then mourn and think about the baby that would have been and let her lean on you.  It is harder on the woman but it is hard on you too so make sure you have someone you can talk to.  Be calm and quiet and still and just be there for her and cry with her.<br>  <br>  I hope that this is all useless advice and not needed. Really good luck with everything ... tomorrow and in the future.|`|y1JZlSuRaa	As a woman who has had both a stillborn baby and an early miscarriage, don't say we can have another or you'll get pregnant again, or anything along those lines, please.  It will happen for you guys but to hear the words so soon can make it seem as if your ready to move on already as if this pregnancy wasn't as important as it should have been to you.  You and your wife need time to grieve the loss of this child. <br>  Be kind and gentle, hold her and mourn with her. Get angry together and cry together. You can't change it or make it better, there are no magic words, all you can do is let the emotions flow.  Give each other as much time as necessary, and when your ready make sure to talk about how you feel with each other. <br>  I'm sorry for your loss.|`|2eaq8YMYaa	I have never had one, although I've read blogs of women who have.  From a woman's perspective, we don't want a guy to analyze the situation and try to "fix" it.  My best advice is to be a shoulder to cry on- hold her close, snuggle her, give her lots of hugs, and just let her talk about it, cry, and vent her feelings.  Let her know that you are sad about it too and that it wasn't her fault at all. Try to do nice little things like bring her breakfast in bed.<br>  <br>  At the same time, this was your child too, so I hope you are doing ok?  I'm so sorry if it does turn out to be a m/c.  Try to take good care of yourself!|`|xmVGViPiaa	Just be there for her to hold her hand and support her.  If she is miscarrying and this was a planned for and wanted pregnancy, she may be very upset if she did miscarry.  When you get home let her rest and maybe take over some of her duties if you can for a while.  She might not want to talk about it for a while, but if she wants to talk about it then listen to her and support her.  If not, then just wait until she is ready... Some women it takes them weeks, months, etc to get over this and then other women it doesn't bother them as much.  |`|2127cb3cd6d76b0afc40faacb0284333aa	My sister had one recently and her hubby totally dropped the ball - she is feeling like a failure - shes angry and sad and all her baby dreams she had for this one have just gone down the drain (no pun intended)<br>  The only thing you can do  - and probably the best thing - is give her lots of hugs and holding - dont try to offer advice - just mourn with her  - and lots of hugs|`|Efa5EYJJaa	I have miscarried several times. Most men, I have heard, just don't get it. You seem to be a very sensitive and loving husband. That right there will help a lot. My husband never brought it up. He waited until I said something and listened. Don't try to solve the problem just listen and let her cry. She may be angry don't take it personally, she is not angry with you. My husband bought me flowers and wrote me letters. He told me I was beautiful and how much he loved me. I hope that everything works out for the best. Hopefully she didn't lose the baby. Good luck.|`|vRQaON5Uaa	If she did have a miscarriage you need to be there for her 110%, its really rough looking forward to having a baby and then realizing you've lost him/her. Don't push her to do things she doesnt want to do.. if she just wants to sleep.. i'd say let her do so. my best friend went through a miscarriage and was torn apart. the only thing anyone can really do is be there for them when needed. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|isgmgHMuaa	comfort her, stay by her side, let her know this is big for you too. let her know you care and make her as happy and content as possible. it wont be easy, but she'll remember as time passes.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	sorry if so...<br>  <br>  its good that you are ready to hear anything they tell you.<br>  hold her hand when they tell her the news and if she starts crying, comfort her always throughtout the doc appointment and after/before.<br>   she will probably need a moment also to recollect what is happening /happened sorta thing.<br>  <br>  You know obviously whats happening and going on/ emotion and life wise, think of it as if you were her.<br>  <br>  Comfort her no matter what, if it happens tell her , that you will try again, tell her you love her. and its not any of your faults, it could have been something that was wrong inside and god didnt let it get worse. (mis/c happen bcuz of that).<br>  <br>  Your a good person, you will know what to do tomorow ;)<br>  God bless you and your wife xx|`|mkveZfqOaa	How sweet you are.  Just be there for her, let her cry on your shoulder let her talk about it all she wants even if you are turning blue in the face.  :)  Maybe make her dinner and keep house for her for a few days until she is feeling better.  Good luck to you both!|`|Hv6sGOt8aa	Support her...let her(and encourage) crying, mourning, sadness, guilt, and whatever else she throws your way.  I gave birth to a stillborn baby boy in 2004, nothing my husband did or said helped...that is normal.  She will eventually understand that you are grieving as well.  Don't discourage any thoughts and/or feelings she is having, it's all part of the process.  This answer is on the assumption she has miscarried....why do you think that?|`|frpCK0utaa	All you can do is be there for her. Be strong, because if its true, she and you are going to need each other.|`|TlA2z5XJaa	Cuddle her, sympathise with her, be upset with her and be gentle to her.

xPfJG3FGaa	girl i went through the same thing, i still am! I went crazy i eventually was like you know what i need help i told my doctor everything that was going on and they put me on prozac, the thing was they didn't want me to start it til i was in my second trimester, so i waited a little while, but now i'm doing so much better, i still got my problems with the guy i'm pregnant to, the only difference is i don't get as worked up now, like before i would cry and cry and go to every payphone seeing if he would pick up another number, i would drive myself crazy just thinking about what he was doing, now with the medicine i'm more calm, and my mind doesn't just go crazy out of nowhere, i told the doctor i wasn't sure about taking medicine because of the baby, and she toldme that stressin the way i was would cause more harm to the baby than the medicine, ive been on it now for a couple months, but i still need to get rid of this a**hole, he aint no good but it aint easy especially when ur pregnant! But whenever u feeling stressed e-mail me we can try to figure out a way to get over these dumb a** Mother F**ckers|`|MNDvP3rxaa	find a new man. hes not worth your time, energy and stress. and definetly not worth the health of your baby. i know its easier said then done, but seriously if hes not answering your phone calls, and its his baby, hes just a pile of crap. Im not sure if stress can actually hurt the baby, but babies know how you are feeling, and they feel the same way, so calm down, and forget about that jerk, you dont need him. besides, you can just get child support if you need to.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	why are people being mean to you?<br>  <br>  Anyway stress can hurt a baby at any stage of pregnancy. You need to really try to de-stress. I know it can be hard, but anything will help. Maybe a long walk with the ipod, a warm bath, or some girl time with your friends. Absolutely NO talking about your baby's dad. |`|DcffYZo5aa	stress is not go for u or the baby and honestly stressin about him cheatin is not going to change if he cheats ....i was the same way my husband was doin things he shouldnt have early in our relationship and i thought about it day and night what he could be doing ....then i finally realized why am i stressin if he does it than forget him ...and i moved on ...he just decided to move on with me lol .....things only work out for the best when their out of ur hands ive decided|`|xmVGViPiaa	Stress can be harmful in your pregnancy.  Your baby feels everything you feel.  It also is not healthy for you.  Women who are in a lot of stress during pregnancy usually have many more complications than women who don't.  <br>  <br>  You have a baby to think about now.  It's time to evaluate your relationship with the father of your baby.  If there is a trust issue it may be best to just break it off with him.  It's hard to have someone's baby who doesn't seem to care that much for you but it's even harder to be chasing someone around and stressing out while you are pregnant.  You are only 6 weeks pregnant, it's only going to get worse - I am 34 weeks pregnant and I can't even imagine having to chase my fiance around... I don't think I would be able to handle the stress.<br>  <br>  Your baby deserves better -- do what is best for you and your child, you both deserve it. |`|TWyWQKlqaa	being really stressed could hurt the baby.<br>  <br>  To relieve stress you could try yoga, I hear it is very good for that type of thing.<br>  You could also see a doctor because they can sometimes come up with good things to help with stress.<br>  You could start a hobby which is really calming.  You would choose a time where you wouldn't worry about anything, only concentrate on your hobby. My mother picked up knitting. You could try knitting something for the baby - but beware, I actually find knitting stressful at times because if you make a mistake you have to restart your project. It could still be a stress reliever if you don't concentrate on finishing it, just on the process.<br>  You could start a diary to write everything in, sometimes that can help, but it might make you more stressed while you are writting about things.<br>  You could see a pshychiatrist, it is actually really helpful to talk to someone you don't really know about your problems. This would probably be very helpful.<br>  You could get a stress ball.<br>  You could get a pillow specifically for beating up. This can help release the stress in your body, you might feel better after.<br>  That's all the ideas I can think of at the moment, but you can probably find many more over the internet.<br>  I hope you find a way to relieve your stress, and good luck with the baby.|`|3YxowxIPaa	if i knew where u lived i would knock your head off...do not let that man stress that baby. stress can effect a baby at any time in pregnancy and more so now cuz it need u to be as healthy as ever in the first trimester..if hes messing around forget him and focus on the baby and if he got u pregnant and u know that for a fact (not saying u don't) take his *** for child support..its just that simple if u need help theres always someone who can help u. and hes a deadbeat and if ur willing to be with him after hes blatantly hurting u then u know what screw him and turn that anger and frustration into love for your baby. |`|rQGNLkNiaa	yes it could hurt the baby and its not good for you either.|`|0f8Cyn6Waa	Here is some info for you.|`|OcyYvs51aa	it could if the baby is part of the argument|`|9Qlt0yWgaa	theyre still human|`|H1NjIT10aa	Sugar this is a prime example of why you shouldn't be messin around until you have the ring on the finger and the I Do's behind you.  <br>  <br>  Many males are fickle and aren't in it for the long haul.  Write the sucker off your list and move on with your life  for the sake of your child.|`|uODK3d08aa	YES!!<br>  it will harm the baby!<br>  you need to stop stressing!<br>  <br>  tell your man to stop being a pussy <br>  and stop thinking only about himself!<br>  <br>  remind him that he has a baby coming and he needs to take some responsibilities!<br>  <br>  <br>  i wish you a happy pregnancy!!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  
xmVGViPiaa	It sounds to me like pregnancy is likely, however you could be thinking in your mind you are pregnant which can cause you to experience the symptoms.  Every month I would TTC my body would make up symptoms and fool me into thinking I was pregnant, pretty cruel :D<br>  <br>  It may be too early to tell you are pregnant with an HPT.  I could not get a positive til the day OF my missed period and even then it was so faint I had to use a digital the day after to make sure it was a real positive.  Even when I went to the Dr they commented on how light the results were... So I would say it is possible you are too early to get a result.  I would keep testing every couple days with first morning urine.|`|ySUlYRZ9aa	Its not too soon to do a test. Go for it.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	When did you have sex? Conception could be up to two or three days after that.|`|Njf3mot4aa	The HPT should work so i am guessing you are not pregnant.  This could be PMS symptoms.  The heartburn is probably separate as it does happen in pregnancy but not until much later so I would say you are just bloated w/tingling breast which = PMS.
e3xxes6zaa	Six or seven months is nothing.  Get the full term pregnancy belly and have him wear the damn thing around for a week :)<br>  My husband was super sweet and accomodating about my pregnancy so it never even crossed my mind.   However, i worked as a landscaper until 38 weeks and i sure wish i would have handed one over to some of the gals at work! They would say things like "Wow, it can't be too much, you're still with the rest of us..."  Really, i was just working my tail off till the very end, because any job worth doing is worth doing well, right?|`|Me5P0R1uaa	That is a great idea actually. I might get my hubby to wear one when I start to get bigger! :)|`|TzWkvyctaa	No that is weird!!!|`|xmVGViPiaa	It would be funny to see... But my boyfriend already pretty much knows what it's like to be pregnant.  He sees me everyday and he basically goes through it with me.  My boyfriend has also made the comment about me being big and pregnant, but he does not say it in a negative way because he'll also tell me I am beautiful while he is saying it (he usually says it when I tell him I feel like a cow).<br>  <br>  But my boyfriend was there through the morning sickness and now he's here through all of the 3rd trimester symptoms.  I tell him how I feel all of the time and he seems to understand.  I guess he doesn't know exactly how it feels, but he at least has an understanding and appreciation for what it does to the body.  Wearing a pregnancy pack won't give him all of the things you will face during pregnancy either - maybe just a backache.  There's a whole slew of things you may experience from nausea and vomiting to swollen ankles and high blood pressure.... A pregnancy pack won't give him all of those so even so he will have to have some blind appreciation for what you are going through.|`|GrE2oN9Naa	I think it's actually pretty weird to do that. I don't want to experience things men go through, why would I want my husband to experience what I go through? We're different for a reason. =) I would never ask my husband to do that.|`|xPEEnKfeaa	My hubby held pillows that represented the weight of the sac and baby. He also had to act as though he was the one birthing during a weekend birthing seminar we took.|`|BXjUSgLTaa	my boyfriend use 2 talk about how he wanted to get me pregnant so i made him wear it he knows how i feel know |`|2HSXP1vTaa	I have three children and I could not afford a pregnancy pack simply because, every time I went shoping I would say " Awh, that worul be so cute for our baby" and buy something for our unborn child. My husband got a little jelouse of my spending and would end up buying something for himself.  It was cute at first but later became the topic of arguments. I can only tell you the after baby point of view, because I can't remember a whole lot before that.  I remember our second child and how I kept thinking my man is never there, how am I suppose to do everything?, and our arguing endlessly about our habbits and what effect they would have on our children.  Habbits of leaving and not saying anything, overspending on ourselves and not our children, work schedules and trusting eachother to keep the same rules when eachother is not around... the list is endless.  I have to wonder if it takes everyone five years to instill the same values as the "system" has in mind for good parenting into their men or was my husband just that reluctant?  I do know if your man doesn't do a lot around the houes or has some of the bad habbits that I had mentioned... the joy is gone when you find out you are pregnant.  Post pardem depression sets in, the female worries about everything, and if you do not have a kind enough man you may find yourself in tears a few times.  Take the time to really talk out the details of your future relationship.  The hard way is getting married because you have children.  That was my choice and I know now my husband does love me and we do make a good team, but it took about five years.  Five years of bickering, fighting, threatening to leave, all because we rushed into a relationship.  AGAIN...TAKE YOUR TIME|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	My Lamaze instructor had one that DH tried with our first. I was amusing to see what each of the guys in the class looked like with it, and how their opinions changed after wearing one for even a few minutes. I have a great picture of my husband trying extra hard to bend down to pick something up off the floor. Heh heh (just for proof LOL) |`|AA10315542	.no, they are too expensive
3X0t8JrXaa	I don't think anything is wrong.  Your breasts will be sore at times and not at others.  Morning sickness on average doesn't start until 8 weeks...some women never get it.  Every women is different so don't be too overly concerned.|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	You are fine.  The only sign I had was tender breast and I was sleepy a lot.  The tenderness would come and go, some days it would hurt super bad and other days they wouldn't hurt at all.  Congratulations!|`|6ZUnRxV5aa	Consider yourself one of the lucky ones for not experiencing any of the morning sickness symptoms yet. I had morning sickness as early as 4wks pregnant up to until i was 12wks. Every woman is different when it comes to morning sickness & sorness of the breast. Everything should be fine, just make sure to mention to the doctor how you have been feeling.|`|Fa130w6Gaa	That is normal. Not everyone gets morning sickness or even many symptoms.You have the same symptoms as I had for both pregnancies and this one seems to be starting the same. Sore nipples and almost feel narcoleptic at times. lol Congratulations and I hope your pregnancy continues to go smoothly!|`|84b26tbzaa	sure hun everything will be fine, all pregnancy's are different and some mothers don't experience certain symptoms trust me consider yourself lucky but remember you have a long way to go and you may start to experience brest tenderness and other symptoms soon just relax an rest while you can im 18 weeks and my nights are starting to become sleepless i wish my pregnancy was as easy as yours ha ha but you will be ok.......good luck! and congrats!|`|azrKKNfTaa	i didnt get symptoms till around 9 weeks its normal. and my nipples themselves never really got sore.<br>  everyone is diffrent some women dont get morning sickness at all
AA11301623	You know, I had something similar happen to me, too.  I had spotting on and off for about a week and a half that ranged from pink, to a little red, to brown.  I freaked...you don't want to be seeing this, right? You read all the books who say it's not normal but common. Well that certainly doesn't make you feel better, at least it didn't for me.<br>  <br>  But then I read up more on it, and called the ER several times (I think I called them 4 times over it just to be sure), AND talked to my doctor. I was informed this is normal and common, usually associated with implantation bleeding. So as long as you aren't filling a pad in an hour, or feeling any pain, your baby should be fine.<br>  <br>  This occurs to A LOT of women who have healthy babies, so don't stress. I'm sure everything will be fine. Hard to do, I know cuz I worried just the same, but most likely it's fine. If you are worried, do like I did and call your doctor. :D<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|9bUN1AHFaa	I hope this sticks for you too.  Around my 6th week or so of pregnancy I had some light pink spotting that lasted about a day and all was fine.<br>  <br>  Some bleeding is normal during pregnancy, I would see your doctor about it.  It's probably fine unless you have cramping.<br>  <br>  Good Luck hun, I am sending some sticky dust for you!!|`|xmVGViPiaa	Brown blood is not normally the blood you would worry about.  I would mention it to the Dr but try not to worry.  Brown blood is old blood and it may just be that there was some blood trapped that is now leaking out.<br>  If it gets worse or turns red then I would call the Dr immediately.  But many women experience spotting around this time and continue on to have a healthy pregnancy.

She's not stuck up. And it fits her perfectly. She's very girly with just the right touch of tomboyishness. :) We don't call her Vicky. Which could be the downside of naming her Victoria cause people used to want to do that. But we didn't like it so we kept calling her Victoria or Toria.|`|QrOJ8f7aaa	Victoria. I once knew this really annoying girl named Leah and now i cannot STAND that name.<br>  My cousin's name is Victoria though, and she's awesome.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I really like both but I would chose Victoria. It is a classic name that is not over used like Leah can be.  There is also ways to shorten it.

tkSXjqhuaa	I didnt have an epidural, but I called my mom and she said most of the time its a normal side effect and to take motrin, if it continues, make an appointment.<br>  <br>  <br>  Give MY little girl kisses for me<3 haha.|`|u94HOVz7aa	i got a "spinal headache" after my epidural.  it was so debilitating i couldn't even nurse my son i would get dizzy and nauseous every time i opened my eyes. they had to do a "blood patch" to cure it.  which was basically like getting another epidural.  ugh!!!|`|f0c14af9cf77a6bb68c4ffdbb372cdacaa	One of my colleagues was told that she couldn't have an epidural as she suffered from migraines and that giving an epidural would cause extreme headahces after wards however I suffer from extreme migraines and was given an epidural and was fine, I have heard mixed reports though that headaches can be caused by epidurals, something to do with a spinal block or something.  If it hasn't cleared by Monday then I would mention it to your doctor.  Hope you feel better soon and congratulations on your little daughter|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	Headaches are a common side effect of the epidural.  It's normal.|`|KCduHtlqaa	You should make an appointment. Epidurals can cause what doctors would call a spinal headache. Just to be on the safe side you should get it checked out.|`|AA11066099	Hi, yes tell your doctor on Monday.x
QSJorZanaa	Not to worry I have had 6 vaginal birth's and had some tearing with each one of them.My personal experience with these same symptoms was that the itching was caused by the tear and stitches healing.I would really not get concerned unless you start to having pain in the area,discharge that is not the normal color or smell.Sry if that is T.M.I but it is the truth... Well congratulations on your new baby boy and I hope this will ease your worry a little...|`|IYmy1BkBaa	I've never had a child, but I would say that if everything else is normal down yonder, that it would be just the tear healing.  No increased discharge, or yeast infection discharge is a good thing, I'd figure. You know when you hurt yourself, it starts itching like mad when it heals.|`|tbeO3Lataa	Yes, very normal. It's just like, you know how when you get a paper cut, it doesn't always hurt, but it itches? Sort of the same thing. Some swelling will also probably show up. <br>  <br>  To look out for signs of infection, though, make sure it never becomes too swelled and red, or, and again, probably TMI, but also look out for excessive amounts of white discharge.<br>  <br>  Yes, continue to clean often, and you could probably use a medicated wipe, though I would check with your doctor first.|`|wBpennsMaa	I had a C Section 15 days ago and about 7 days post partum I started itching down there but it was accompanied with burning during urination. It ended up I have a bladder infection. Congrats and good luck!|`|hSJnaysiaa	Itching is a good thing in this case. It means you are healing where you were stitched up.<br>  <br>  Its normal. I would call and speak with a nurse about any types of lotions or creams you can use on it to ease the bothersome itching but otherwise you should be fine (don't itch too hard though because if you tear a stitch out you have to start all over again with the healing process).<br>  <br>  Congrats on your baby! He's beautiful!|`|Fa130w6Gaa	It sounds like the itching is most likely from the healing. Did your doctor give you anything to put on it? I had an episiotimy with my son (13 years ago) and the doctor gave me a foam and also preperation h pads to help with the swelling and itching. If they didn't give you anything, you should check with your doctor and see what they advise you to use. Congrats on the new baby!|`|gdCqKl89aa	As the tear heals, the skin will itch. Just keep rinsing it with warm water with the squirt bottle they gave you...when the stitches heal, the itching will stop! Totally normal (wish it was in books so less ppl worried)|`|txv7TIgiaa	i got stitches to and that is just your bady healing...
jfABMUJcaa	My doctor said no tampons for 6 weeks.  The first time I tried to use a tampon after giving birth (maybe about 7 weeks) it was too painful!  Uh... the after birth bleeding is not pretty- not that periods are pretty either.  Really smelly at first.  At first the blood is dark and very clotty (old blood).  After a few weeks it gets redder and there are less clots.  |`|xmVGViPiaa	I would not use a tampon.  For one, they are not really strong enough to hold all of the blood you will be bleeding out (a thick pad will hold more, and you can buy some that are specially made for after birth), for two they also can carry infection on them if you don't change them enough.... I think it is just a better idea to use a pad, similar to what the hospital will give you after you give birth.<br>  <br>  The blood may have clots and such in it but it should not be a lot of clotting.  At first you will bleed a lot but eventually the amount you bleed will decrease.  If you experience a lot of clotting and cramps then it's best to go to your doctor ASAP.|`|LJGzpSmyaa	for the first week or so it may be a little too tender to use a tampon you will also loose clots for the first couple of weeks but as soon as the clotting stops but its fine, just treat it as a period and to expel it a little quicker give your tummy a little massage and squeeze your pelvic floor muscles while on the toilet between changes.. <br>  The blood will be very dark at the beginning and smells a little stronger because it has been sitting around for 9 months rather than the usual 28 days.|`|AA10391082	no you can't use a tampon because it will clot up and after the first week it starts to get lighter then lighter then yellow then white then gone..lol oh and it doesn't really smell.<br>  <br>  <br>  no tampons 6 weeks well they say 6 weeks but my doctor told me if it didn't hurt that bad i could use them when the clots were gone! so about 2 weeks|`|824e72f9c0bacc445b1ea6ada3d01531aa	ok no u cant use a tampon the flow will be just too heavy for a tampon..maybe after a cpl weeks u can start using a tampon but i wud ask my doctor bout it...<br>  u also get special heavy pads in the hospital..when u deliver ur nurse will give them to u her/himself<br>  the bleeding dsnt hurt and it is somewhat the same smell and same colour fr sure and clots r there too|`|5NShLkTkaa	My last baby was 28 years ago, but when I read your question about a tampon after birth, my legs closed involuntarily!  Lol. Yeah, as I remember, it's pretty much the same.|`|AA11110785	No, you aren't supposed to use a Tampon.  You will be passing some blood clots and you can get an infection if they weren't allowed to pass which a tampon would do.  <br>  Bleeding after having a baby is heavier with blood clots.  It will lighten up after a week or two and be more like a normal period and then you can use a tampon if you want but it's best not to.  
3WLLPFK3aa	Well I just turned 21 on 10/17, my due date was 11/21, my baby girl was delivered 11/11 . Georgia<br>  <br>  ** GET ALL THE REST U  CAN NOW !!! ** |`|ZZk4utbQaa	Congrats. Im not pregnant but I had the same experience. I actually just made 21 was going out with my boyfriend to bars and clubs and I was loving it I felt I just hit my prime and I was ready.

I can't explain it the feelings that were coming thru me it was crazy all this emotion and so much for girls our age. Well anyways I had him in March of 08 and I couldn't be any happier. I live on maui and he loves the beach!

uu9lGT1waa	why wait. you are high risk. there is no time to wait!!! Tell her immediately! Please!|`|ioZeveazaa	Your mother is going to find out if you sign up for Medicaid however honestly I think it is very smart of you to take the upper hand in this situation. It shows alot of maturity that you want to get to the doctor and are examining your options. If I was your mother I would be proud of you for trying to take care of it yourself. Don't be afraid of what she is going to think/say. I bet she will be happy that you are taking initative. Good luck!|`|4d6c3d0b31cdd0d3e713e6f283397254aa	well they do need to know your address and phone number so there is a chance she could found out|`|ovgxECKsaa	If you are still living at home with your mom and not married, Medicaid will look at her income to decide if you are eligible.  So, yes she will find out.  Plus as you get larger with pregnancy, there is no way to hide it.  The sooner you tell your mom the better.|`|mdwyZpyHaa	Please tell your mother now.  You need her help and support. Yes, she will be disappointed in you- Yes she will carry on-But she'll do it later anyway!  Stop putting it off. Let her help you. |`|AA10186411	Well your babies health is more important than your mother finding out.  So I suggest you go ahead and apply regardless.  Stop being immature.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	im 15 and i live in alabama and they told me i had to be 18 for sign up for it by my self|`|nomkuPC6aa	You're still minor so you can't sign yourself up for insurance.<br>  Do you not have health insurance already?<br>  <br>  If you're high risk (you don't say why) you are going to need to tell your mother immediately. Don't play around with this. You're mature enough to have a baby- be mature enough to tell your mother.<br>  <br>  Doctor visits aren't even the beginning of expensive.<br>  If you can't afford healthcare- you may want to sit and take a really long look at if you can provide for this baby. Their care and upkeep is expensive.<br>  <br>  If you're seriously going to act juvenile (by not telling your mother immediately) you need to think about giving the baby up so it can have a fighting chance at being provided for.|`|SMkB2LKIaa	I'm really not sure. Do you live with your mom? If you do and since you are only 16, they might need to include your mom's income when they evaluate you to see if you qualify. Your best bet would be to call up there and ask. If they say no, then go ahead and go up there to apply, and if they say yes, then you need to tell your mom beforehand so she can do whatever it is she has to do for you to get the medicaid.<br>  <br>  |`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	It varies from state to state, some require your parent or guardian's signature to apply for forms of government assistance. Also you cannot be treated medially without your parent/guardian present or a signed permission slip as you are not legal age. So just tell your mom, don;t make this situation any worse than it has to be, the sooner you tell her the better off you will be. She will probably help you with a lot of things if she knows, versus you having to do them on your own. Just remember your mom loves you, so don;t be afraid to tell her. Good luck to you.|`|zF4acGKPaa	she doesnt have to approve it but you have to list every one living in the home. because it is based on the household income. However hun she will eventually find out! i was 17 and pregnant and scared to tell her i finally got the guts when i was 3 months and told her! at first she was dissapointed in me but than was very excited about buying things!|`|AA10458750	First off, you CANNOT get medicaid on your own. Until you are 21 if you live at your mommas house, they require HER income(paystubs) and then they will call her to verify information. And if you move somewhere else, you are still under 18 and you still won't be able to apply without her & her income. I know it is scary to tell her, but you need to get that application in. Medicaid is slow enough girl, hurry up and tell her!!|`|9mGajrJxaa	Honey i am 17 so take it from me. Your mom might be upset for like 5 minutes but then she will get so excited. you are HIGH RISK. she need to know IMMEDIATLY. I am not being mean at all iknow it is scary. i am 17 weeks or 21 weeks we dont know and i might be having twins. and through all this my mom has been my best friend. also my dad is an OB/GYN not mine but he is one.|`|JbkHLcAWaa	i don't think you have to tell your mom. and because you are pregnant they will give you medicaid and you will not have to pay for anything.|`|dq04utMoaa	I think she has to include her income. you were a big girl when you got knocked up so be  a big girl again and tell her you got PREGNANT !!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|KUQuL1jXaa	why the hell are you not going to tell her that you are pregnant yet? if you doctor visits are going to be expensive then you should tell your mom so she can help you sign up for the insurance! ya your only 16 your a minor, it looks like you will have to tell your mom, and do it asap<br>  <br>  besides your on the high risk, duhhh everyone knows that is nothing to play around with....|`|n3fCHMLVaa	You should call your local medicaid office. You should tell your mom, you need the support. She might get suspicious if mail from the medicaid office comes and no one in the house is on medicaid. Good luck and I wish you a healthy pregnancy!|`|rFx5J1b7aa	yes because you cant go on anything with out your parents pormishion.  If anything they will call your house.  They will mail you stuf.. Just tell your mother.  She will get over it. Do it now so you both can get insurance see because your a minor getting insurance goes by your parents income!|`|xmVGViPiaa	I'm on Medicaid.  They will probably mail stuff to your house, like newsletters and your insurance card/documents, etc.  If you get the mail everyday then I imagine your parents wouldn't find out about it.|`|fG5dyYSNaa	I don't think by law they can tell her. So until you tell her or you begin to "show" she wont know because of a doctor telling her. 
F6hI80hgaa	You can eat any meat as long as it is well done.  There are some kinds of fish you cannot have.|`|72fba73d98e8f519a559d0acea78733faa	Of course you can eat deer meat.|`|AA11119636	deer meat is ok...as long as it's fully cooked|`|M1UiYHi5aa	yeah i did!! |`|xmVGViPiaa	You can eat almost any meat as long as it is fully cooked.  It's best to stay away from many fish which are high in mercury though.  You can have tuna and salmon but you need to limit the amount you eat because the mercury can hurt your baby.<br>  <br>  For more info, go here: <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/foodstoavoid.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnan...</a><br>  |`|fdfbb3fed9f6fe854aebbc3c863b7bb5aa	Congrats!

I ate tons of deer meat when I was pregnant with my first child.|`|fdWIP0Yiaa	sure, as long as it is cooked thoroughly
RRNQTvZeaa	I would not hire a babysitter that close to your childs age. A tweleve year old is not responsible to watch two kids, feed them, ect. Depending on your state, many have laws about children being left alone in the home depending on the ages. I know in all states you could not leave them overnight with a 12 year old. Seriously your best bet would be to either look into the laws before you hire this child, or find someone in highschool or college. Average hourly rate is like 5-6 dollars|`|OYcB4rvraa	I would say $7 becusae thinking about it, that is minimum wage and they are doigna job! ps. If she babysits late you should give her a bit of a tip. nothing over 5 dollars thoug. Once I babsat these people and they gave me $15 dollars to much and I felt bad.|`|22GMiNzaaa	Depends on how long, i would say at that age pay her 4 dollars an hour!<br>  <br>  Mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvqK.P8kIdaXQpSotiKXizXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081108114828AAgu1xP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  |`|cI2wNDOQaa	Depending on the law for minimum wage for most U.S. states, most minimum wage prices are 2.00 to 8.00 every hour the babysitter helps and if you want, you can double it for your two kids.|`|B9S25Ezkaa	I started babysitting at the age of thirteen and I charge the same rate I do now- ￡3.50 per hour, in US dollars that's approximately $5.53 per hour<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! ^_^|`|jrvwyoN6aa	If it was me, I would pay min wage... not less than.  I got paid $5 an hour when I babysat, but that was a good 17 years ago...  inflation affects kids too  :O)|`|8dtM31OJaa	I get six dollars, but I babysit a baby. Older kids are sometimes a little easier because they poop on their own and can feed themselves. I'd say 5 bucks an hour. Or give her set monthly check if the hours stay the same. Like 200 bucks.|`|WZRdeMRPaa	5$ an hour. That's what I get..ahahaha.
hRf3dSnhaa	if you want free stuff, I really really like <a href="http://www.sampleaday.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sampleaday.com</a> for it. They sort through and find the legit samples so you don't have to. They are great because they are updated daily and all of their offers are "catch free", that means no long surveys, no pay offers. They also have a e-mailing list where they send you the free samples listed on their site. I use that so I get them in my email which comes daily. It isn't required though to get the freebies. Sometimes their descriptions are pretty funny too! If you are looking for a specific type of free sample, there is a categories list and a search bar right above categories so that you can do searches.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh yes if you are from Canada you might like:<br>  <a href="http://www.canadasamples.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.canadasamples.com</a><br>  <br>  If you are from the UK you might want:<br>  <a href="http://www.uksamples.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.uksamples.com</a><br>  <br>  WHAT I GOT:<br>  Today I just got a Kashi Bar....

uZUi0kGdaa	I prefer it spelled Isla, which is pronounced "EYE-la" as well.<br>  I think of someone of spanish or african american decent with that name. I personally wouldn't consider it.|`|P37lIBr2aa	I LOVE that name. It's very uncommon and sophisticated. Though I do like the original spelling Isla better. Aila looks like it's pronounced Aye-La.|`|Q2xkBdrEaa	I am reminded of a indian song aila aila aila re....|`|wzmo2Ju7aa	I love it, but I've been using the spelling Isla. One of my favorite names is A?la Jade/ Isla Jade.|`|l4gqo2LBaa	I like the name its pretty. <br>  <br>  I think it would get mispronounced alot  spelled Aila <br>  How about Eila or Eylah?<br>  <br>  I think Jane, May, Rose and Sage all sound nice as middle names|`|4ZnqA7vgaa	uhh. What about Delilah? Aila sounds african or a little hindie...
3X0t8JrXaa	Oh jeez!!! Okay well she would've ovulated on days 12-16 which translates to 8th-12th....so with that most likely its guy #2.  HOWEVER...with guy#1 being on the 7th...its possible just not likely.  With the details given I think a paternity test is the only thing your friend can do.  :-\|`|syrh8J6Vaa	In the right conditions sperm has the possibility of living 7 days inside a woman's body.  So it is possible that the sperm from feb 7th could have still been alive in her until the 13th.  You have no idea without dna who the father is.  Even though guy one didn't finish in her he could have had 1 extremely strong sperm that lasted long enough to get her pregnant.  Good luck hun|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Guy 2 is far more likely to be the father, but the timing too close to really call. The only way to know for sure is wait for the DNA test.|`|00P38FKraa	Whoever that is is a hoe no doubt about it...I feel sorry for the child whoever the father might be.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	90% chance guy 2|`|fwro8soqaa	Honestly, it could very easily be either man.  It doesn't matter how many times you have sex with someone, and once there's penetration, pregnancy is possible. There is sperm in pre-***.  As a side note, unprotected sex in a non-monogamous situation is never a good idea.  STD's are a very real problem.  The only way to find out is a paternity test.|`|tAFPbAUaaa	I'd say most likely Guy 2, but I'd still continue with the paternity test you mentioned. Good luck.|`|PvnnWE1Baa	"He who is without sin, cast the first stone.."<br>  I hate when ppl judge others like that, anyways, seems like Guy 2.|`|P0SUF7Fwaa	omgsh! people are so judgemental lol anyways<br>  <br>  <br>  there is a good chance on either one, just have her take a paternity test|`|5h8bYsKdaa	thats slutty. i dont get how some women can go from one man to the next within days! get a dna test. or end up on maury.|`|T0NvgQTUaa	I would assume its Guy 2. But Id still get the test just in case.|`|NDpO8hX4aa	guy 2|`|f5yf9t3Haa	jeeze...condoms???|`|TFuCMwUWaa	I would say Guy #2, with a perfect 28 day cycle she should have been ovulating around February 11-13, perfect time for conception.  But 100% can't be sure have to do a paternity test for that.  Best of luck.|`|QSodlfMraa	guy 2 i would say.
Ruifi0GSaa	Yeah I say guy # 2, she would of gotten prego on the 12th or 13th. Hope that helps, good luck|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	dude 2|`|zY9PdRGjaa	am i understanding guy 1 did not ejaculate in her?? if that is the case im going with guy #2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... or the one that is more responsible...|`|qfSKgxDsaa	most likely guy 2 but it could be guy 1 because you an get pregnant even if he doesn't go inside you|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	guy 2|`|pnL5WTXMaa	your parents must be proud|`|rBq189W1aa	If your slutty friend can't even figure it out, what hope do you think we have?|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Guy 2, according to some studies there is no semen in pre-***. From those studies there is no way it could be guy number 1.|`|sQsw8Rykaa	for what you are saying looks like guy 2.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	probably guy 2
xmVGViPiaa	I took one dose of it.<br>  It made me very sleepy and groggy.  I stopped taking it because it made me so sleepy though.<br>  <br>  I've heard a lot of people say it works for them though, I hope it does for you.|`|VF2K7yYraa	my wife has taken it for our last 2 pregnancies. She's taken it through the first trimester both times and then stopped it. Usually takes it at night with a glass of milk. Hope this helps.
F9AiIcVfaa	yeah thats a lot of appointments. with both pregnancy i go once a month until 8 months then go every 2 weeks, and in the ninth month i went every week. |`|fMnzjULCaa	I had my 1st visit (where we talked a lot) at 8 weeks. I didn't pee in a cup, I had taken a blood test at 4 or 5 weeks & that's when they scheduled the 1st appointment for the Q & A session. My first ultrasound is this week at 10 weeks & then my 1st vaginal exam is at 12 weeks. So yes, I'm going to have 3 appointments in the first trimester. It would be unusual not to. A) your doctor can only do what the insurance allows her to do & insurances are pretty strict. If it is common place for a doctor to be providing more visits than needed, they will catch on. Trust me, I work for an insurance company. B) you said you have free insurance, if it's government funded, doc is getting paid a lot less than what they do w/ private insurance. Be glad she's not skimping on your care b/c she's not getting paid as much. I've seen it happen plenty of times. She may just have a really good appointment availability. I would've been thrilled to get in that early. My ultrasound seems like it's taking forever!!<br>  <br>  EDIT....it also sounds like they do their bloodwork & urine samples at the office & send it out to a lab. My doctor's is at a hospital, when they want you to have that type of work done, you just have to go to the lab. Had my doctor been doing the work in the office, I possibly could've had 2 more appts, b/c I've been to the lab twice.|`|luNvLaTuaa	im 9 weeks and i only go once  a month to see my doctor. so im not sure why your obgyn wants to see you so much.|`|nkIH17Poaa	Unless you are high risk, it is usual to see your Ob once a month until you are 28 weeks or so, then every two weeks til 36 weeks when it becomes weekly.  This is the norm, but each doc may vary a bit.  Obviously, if you are high risk, it would be more often.  <br>  <br>  As far as the pap, you should just have once provided the first was normal.  You will have a screening for GBS toward the end of your pregnancy which is similar to having a pap smear.|`|Al4c3Zgdaa	You should only go once a month in the first trimester, unless there is something wrong.|`|jJfo5MSWaa	I went to the doctor about 6 times during the first 2 months I knew I was pregnant. However, I have PCOS and hypothyroidism and we didn't think I could get pregnant so they did a few extra ultrasounds, bloodwork, and stuff like that just to make sure my body was doing what it was supposed to. After that I only went once a month until I hit 36 weeks and then I started going once a week again. I only had one pelvic exam in the beginning and then I didn't have another one until 36 weeks. At 36 weeks they started checking me every week to see if I'm dilated, which is quite uncomfortable! <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps! |`|sIQzny5Taa	Well if you have free insurance I wouldn't worry about it, they usually do everything in one day, but I saw my doctor twice in my first trimester some doctors have different procedures than others. I've heard from being on here at different hours during the night that in Europe they usually don't have many doctors appointments, but in America they do more often. I've had like 3 pap smears since I've been pregnant but that's because I've moved and had 3 different doctors. As long as you are being taken care of you and have a good relationship and are comfortable that's all that matters. I haven't seen my new doctor in 1 month and I'm 32 weeks, so I wish my doctor saw me more often. Good luck.|`|jNtkhOTVaa	Unless you're high risk you should probably only be seeing your OBGYN once a month until you're into your 34th-ish week.  Then about every two weeks.  For the last month you should see her weekly.  It doesn't make any sense to see a doctor weekly when you're only 10 weeks along.<br>  I had a pap at my first two visits and then she didn't do anything else down there until it was time to start checking to see if I was dilated (around 35 weeks) she did that weekly.  |`|BXJjoZrnaa	way too many visits for a healthy unrisky pregancy and you should only have a pap on the first visit and your visit at 36 weeks. I would be questioning motives. Congrats

Make them your la-key for anything you need. Breathe threw the contraction and when you feel like you can not take it anymore then go in...but the more you can do at home the better off you'll be...being in the hospital the entire time sucks..but breathe, breathe, breathe...bring that baby down...lol. Good Luck...Oh if you can still talk and be at the PC your still a ways off...when things get annoying and voices piss you off during your contraction you are getting closer to transition.

Try walking and doing squats to help increase contractions.  Also make sure you have everything ready and take a shower that will help you relax a little.  Good Luck|`|HIZ1G175aa	how far along are you|`|NhuxAPFsaa	Go in and tell them you are very uncomfortable, its natural! CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  to the user below me, she is obviously ready to have the baby, she is 2.5 cm dialated, that doesnt typically happen ur 2nd mth~!
y5C6wCAwaa	It's best for children to learn to walk in barefoot.  Their toes help them grip the ground.  If you feel the need for shoes (esp. if it's cold), then the soft soled ones (like Robeez or Ministars) are the best.  She really needs a flexible sole when she starts walking.|`|qjDxKXENaa	no need for walking shoes. babies walks easier on bare feet.|`|etwhvalhaa	my son was standing up from 7 months and still wore soft shoes, its only when he started walkin at 12 motnhs i bought him a pair of nike trainers which are just fine|`|Y6K9jwXzaa	it's better for them to learn barefoot so they can learn how to grip and balance.
3pIBqvWMaa	i got mine out a week ans 1 day ago. am also ttc...i didnt bleed with my implant in and iv not had any period since haveing it out. i only had it in 6 weeks didnt get along with it. then we wanted to try again for baby2..<br>  <br>  anyhow my doctor said fertility returns right away and u can actualy fall pregnant before your first period!! depends on the person really and how long u had it in.<br>  <br>  3 days after removal i had period pains and a show of brownisg bloody dishcharge and nothing since ..so im waiting it out...<br>  <br>  keep at it and fimgers crossed!!|`|c26ifpPDaa	it may take a while for you body to get back in sync.  the synthetic hormones, the birth control, has to leave your body.  this can take a month to a year just depends on your body.  also you can count 28 days from your first day of your period and then you should expect your period within 4 days of that day. <br>  <br>  so for you wait you said you got your preriod on the 21st and had the implanon taken out on the 23rd and also said you didn't bleed with the implanon in.  well if you did start on the 21st you should expect your next period around march 21st.
VoU9WxWaaa	I'm in the same situation.  I'm only 12 weeks, but I have always worn my clothes very close to my body.  And now that I'm thickening up--not necessarily showing--my shirts don't come down as far as they used to.  Soooo, I just got back from buying a couple maternity shirts an hour ago :)  I only bought a couple that I could grow into, but that weren't so baggy that they made me look like a tent.  But, if you're wanting to only have to buy maternity clothes once that will fit you throughout your whole pregnancy, you will end up looking like a tent at first.  So, by a couple of things now that have enough give so that you can make it through 6-7 months.  Then, when you hit the last stage where we all get much bigger, you might have to update your sizes again then.<br>  <br>  I would say that maternity shirts will flatter your body much more than buying bigger sizes, so yes, I think it is worth it to by maternity clothes now. :)<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your little one :)|`|24e8d17e05d1e676ad0be393e961a132aa	I got maternity shirts and I am really glad I did because my belly is way out in front. I know everyone ends up shaped different when they are pregnant, but there is no way I could wear any regular clothes at this point. The only stuff I can wear is maternity clothes and my husband's extra large sweatshirts. So when you have to go out in something other than sweatshirts, you will need maternity shirts. <br>  <br>  I find that regular baby-doll shirts don't work because they don't go down far enough. My belly ended up being way low and in front, so even some of my maternity shirts don't quite cover up the bottom of it. But my regular baby-doll shirt looks like a midriff now. It doesn't go down to my belly button.|`|xmVGViPiaa	I would buy maternity shirts because you will not outgrow them throughout your pregnancy and can wear them the whole time.  I started wearing them as early as possible because I didn't want to buy bigger shirts and then outgrow those and have to spend more $$ buying even bigger shirts afterwards.  Eventually if you are carrying a certain way you will have to wear maternity shirts anyways or your belly will be hanging out.|`|bA1gn6wraa	maturity? Do you mean maternity? I'd say whatever you are more comfy in, I wear a mix of bigger sizes and maternity, I like bigger sizes because they are loose fitting, but when i want to look neater or dressy i choose maternity because they fit my body and are long enough to cover my huge belly!|`|vNKLhNbJaa	You mean maternity shirts?<br>  Yes, they are definately worth it.  Baggy shirts will only work for so long.  I'm even having a hard time getting my husbands shirts over my belly lol. And even then...they arent very fashionable.  Plus, even if you dont mind it tight over your tummy, regular shirts will eventually be too short.<br>  Its very very worth the investment.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I don't buy maternity shirts. I bought some baby doll shirts, and they work fine for me. They're cheaper because you can get them anywhere. lol<br>  <br>  But yeah, if you like maternity shirts why not? Enjoy your shopping! xx|`|4de719cad0916a9e89de3b1afeb52cb6aa	Yeah, buy maternity shirts.  They might not all fit 100% but some of them probably will, and it'll make you feel better to have clothing that fits a pregnant body.|`|rQGNLkNiaa	they're called maternity shirts... and i bought a few. didn't get a whole new wardrobe tho.
cUDUrGyBaa	i am in the same boat as you lol. its a pain, i know...what worked for me was making a bedtime routine...taking a hot shower..once i got out, id lotion up my belly with cocoa butter[no stretch marks for me lol] get into my PJs...and i would warm up hot chocolate and drink that, that relaxed me and sent me straight to bed...and it isnt unhealthy....my dr even informed me that that was a good thing to do even though chocolate does have caffiene and it suggested to help you fall asleep. |`|xmVGViPiaa	A long warm bath, maybe some lavender scented oils or lotions, and some Tylenol PM.|`|epcaiw86aa	idk i have the same problem |`|rx0ekB9Paa	try wearing ur self out before going to bed. take a long walk,do some light workouts,clean the whole house,u know in a ok way exhaust ur self.|`|AA11125475	Exercise, long walk, etc. It's good for you and the delivery will go easier.

190ac0f8aa06b86ea25f6b4aac863fe4aa	Does it feel like you internally ripping? if so, its the baby growing and your uterus stretching. If you feel like it may be something else go to doctors(ER) . You can never be too safe with pregnancy, because weird pains happen all the time that we are not used to. |`|xmVGViPiaa	No, those are called "round ligament pain", you can look that up in google for more information but they are completely normal.  It is just the ligaments in your uterus stretching and loosening up to make more room for your baby.  Try not to move too suddenly, I get them when I move a lot or when I cough/sneeze.|`|HAYPnEbfaa	no theres probably nothing to worry about, you have to realize that your actually carrying a little person in there and he/she is trying to make space in a really cramped area! lol So dont worry about it...|`|6c3c48d39f281011637da6a3756e065aaa	talk to a professional.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Sounds like round ligament pain if it feels like stretching pains.  Baby is getting pretty big now so those wonder pregnancy aches and pains are going to start happening.  |`|Nnplp5Qqaa	It's normal. The baby's getting bigger and developing limbs.
MubTZUKXaa	My baby isn't here yet but I actually done the first earlier this week and couldn't wait to get home!!  My feet and lower back were killing me, I was really sleepy but worst of all I was boiling hot!  I was the worst date ever!  My poor Husband... I moaned the whole time.<br>  <br>  I wish I'd done the second option instead!  Sounds lovely!  Doubt it's somthing I will get to do once the baby is here! x|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I would pick option 2, no question.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Number two. I haven't had a massage in six years.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	Without hesitation it would be the soak in the tub, a massage and lots of sleep.  I would incorporate time with my husband and maybe give him a massage too.  Since a new baby (and even three kids trying for a fourth like us) can have effects on a marriage.  I feel its important to give and take.  I wouldn't want my husband to do something that it is all about me without doing the same for him.<br>  <br>  While my husband has never offered anything like the latter, he does let me sleep in on Saturdays and take a nap on Sunday afternoons (I usually work nights and open on Sunday).|`|m1RTNmqsaa	Option 2.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	2 for sure... OMG give me the Moose Tracks or the Mocha Crunch (tastes like Kahlua)|`|8kaDm2D8aa	tough choice, i would pick theater.  i haven't been out for sooooo long!|`|SjX72fPyaa	Option #2 without a seconds thought lol. I don't get anytime to pamper myself anymore and we could really do dinner and a movie anytime. All we have to do is drop Aisling off at my mums for a few hours. So yeah, I would definitely choose the second option!! :)|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	The second for sure!  I don't even need the tub, massage, ice cream or DVD - just 10 hours on uninterrupted sleep!  With pregnancy and a daughter who never sleeps through the night I haven't had a good nights sleep in 20 months!|`|eUuFPJAFaa	Hmmmm......That's a toughy. Being a very lucky mummy, I get 10 hours uninterrupted sleep anyway, and the bath, DVD and ice cream are all possible if I wish...<br>  <br>  I'll take the meal out I think :)|`|bMvAmMTaaa	i would choose the hot undisturbed soak, a massage, ice cream and dvd, and 10 hours uninterrupted sleep is more than welcome lol.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	Option two all the way.<br>  <br>  10 hours of uninterrupted sleep, of course!!|`|50lIaC8zaa	I would have to say option number 2 without a doubt. lol|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	my baby hasnt came out yet but i would pick option 2|`|5p7cQAokaa	Oh my gosh are you kidding me? NUMBER TWO. No question!!  The tub of ice cream must be the Starbucks coffee flavor with mocha chunks.. If you haven't tried it, go get a tub RIGHT NOW. Lock yourself in the bedroom (leaving Mr. Berry and Baby out in the livingroom) so he has no choice but to give you a break.. oh, and turn up the DVD nice and loud so you can't hear either one of your babies (ha!) crying for mommy!!|`|qj6pv3fUaa	Oh the second one by far! I've got a son who will be 5 next month and a daughter who is 3 as well as a baby on the way and two dogs! Even if I got the 10 hours of uninterrupted sleep I'd be happy! I might have to suggest this to my fiance. He'd probably demand the same think though!|`|2lpDlLLsaa	I would absolutely go for option #1. It's been ages that I have had a long relaxing soak in the tub or a massage. Sleep is non-existent for me, what I would give...No offers for me either.|`|q4ppgGe1aa	I'd have to choose the 2nd option! <br>  <br>  If I had more energy I'd choose the 1st, but when you have a baby, doing something easy & relaxing is more appealing. :)|`|eCJKbAbXaa	Option 2 without a shadow of a doubt!! Option 1 is too much like hard work, i couldn't be arsed with all the getting ready. I'm such a sad loser, post babies!!|`|nwWBddEnaa	option 2 who wouldn't love to spend abit of time alone with the other half, you love your baby but you need some you time, i wish you all the best x|`|yBYQCYGuaa	Bath, massage, ice cream, DVD (of my choice) and 10 hours sleep EVERYTIME!!!!<br>  <br>  I haven't been offered no such choice either *sigh*|`|BDsYZGTqaa	Option 2 definately. I have a seven month old and I would kill for option 2 Lol|`|QXvtl2WMaa	option 2 but add a take away curry, yum!!|`|ZHfvcyjXaa	Dinner and a movie with my husband|`|7a28d05280f8c452210cdbe730862692aa	i would pick soak in the tub option anyday...
s8VgyzE2aa	sadly yes he could fight for rights. I saw a movie once that was based on a true story about a woman who was raped and when the man got out of prison he fought for visitation and parental rights of his child. sick sick sick, I can't remember if he won or not.|`|VHHis05Naa	If she doesn't file charges and he isn't convicted, then YES he can get rights.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	In some sick, convoluted way, he may -- but hopefully he'll be in jail for long enough that he won't care.<br>  Plus she doesn't have to let him know, or that it's his.|`|ZkDjl5I8aa	Well, he CAN get parental rights, though I'm not sure because she was raped. If she knows the rapist, through date or whatever, its basically the same. The only difference is that he would probably get dumped, haha.<br>  I think as laws are changing you probably can't but at the moment you can.<br>  Its a sad sick world.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	If the girl filed charges he would go straight to jail. But when he came out, I suppose he could....he is still the father. That would be such a sad situation though. My guess is if the guy raped her....he doesn't care about the child seeing how he doesn't seem to value people at all, and the only motive for getting rights over the child would be revenge or spite. just sad all around.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	Not a chance in hell. Even if he tries, which he more than likely won't, the court won't give him and rights whatsoever.|`|KKGt03xlaa	Lots of people are misinformed. The criminal act of rape and the family law legislation are completely seperate. His parental rights and rape conviction are 100% seperate. <br>  He would most definetly have parental rights over the child - he is the child's father. Granted, if the father sued the mother for parental rights because she was denying him, I believe a court would impose the most minimal rights (supervised visitations every other weekend) due to the strong aggravating factor surrouding the pregnancy<br>  Also, rapists don't automatically go to jail. Often thimes they don't. Look at the stats|`|qfSKgxDsaa	hell no|`|hl5WdXnbaa	Yes he can<br>  <br>  I know some are saying no because morally it should be no but we have one screwed up court system.<br>  <br>  I know of one case first hand,  the woman was raped, but her rapist was not convicted of his crimes. He latter did sue for child visitation and it was granted. Yes it is supervised visits  but the mom is very upset about this, and rightfully so.<br>  <br>  When the father sued for rights, she was NOT allowed to bring it up in court that he raped her because the charges were dropped.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I saw a movie on Lifetime a few years ago, I don't remember the name but I think it was based on a true story. A woman got raped and ended up pregnant and the man that raped her did file for visitation, he ended up not getting any rights. <br>  <br>  My opinion on it is that if a woman is raped and the man later wants to see the baby and exercise his "rights" that he should NOT have any rights at all to the child.|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	No I wouldn't think so. He would be  a convicted rapist and prolly sitting in jail.  The courts would not allow  the woman to be violated again but  some times  the woman might have an abortion if she is raped by someone she doesn't know.  I am just stating my opinions here.|`|Tj2xROpwaa	omg i certainly hope not. that would be horrible. but she would say he raped her then his *** would be put in jail locked up|`|lFenXNCzaa	He could file for parental rights. Sick & sad world.|`|gP0gYbBaaa	legally yes. if he finds out and wants to be an as*holes.|`|wkmdQnrSaa	this is just my opinion since i was brutally raped when i was only 15 years old, i did not get pregnant from this.  but if she does decide to keep the baby, one she needs to report him and tell people what he did to her, and two, no i don't think he should have any rights as a parent.  nobody goes around raping women and should expect to sue for parental rights.|`|uJJPFJoyaa	I don't understand why people on here are saying "no" , but sadly yes he does, since he is the 'biological' father, he does have rights, now it can go legal meaning either he has to terminate his parental rights and/or a judge will have to take those rights from him.|`|Wf8195iUaa	He would probably have to pay child support, because it is his fault that she is having the baby, but the mother has the right to say that she doesn't want the father to have anything to do with the child.|`|d36OrpbDaa	it sounds like a lot of people are just saying what they THINK it should be.  they don't actually know.<br>  <br>  i don't know the answer either, but i'm sure not going to say "hell no" or "yes he does" just cuz that's my opinion.<br>  <br>  step it up, people!! if you don't know, shut up!<br>  <br>  [i want to know the real answer too]|`|04f31670d4535af3624ffe991782bc4caa	Normally that depends on the law applied on certain country...<br>  Here in Mauritius Island, its says yes the rapist have the right to claim parental right and the sentence may be void if he accept to marry the victim...  so sad to have laws like that..|`|sRKsQEr1aa	Yes she does becuase she dosnt know who the father is and the father would be in jail if they found out soo she would get the baby i think its a law to<br>  <br>  Answer Please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvVyJSzt6ufzc5FXMEP8CArsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307104748AAFiuVW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|pnL5WTXMaa	yes unfortunately. but it can depend whether or not she pressed charges at the time of the rape.<br>  <br>  here's an interesting article.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://birthparents.adoptionblogs.com/weblogs/rights-for-biological-fathers-via-rape" rel="nofollow">http://birthparents.adoptionblogs.com/we...</a>|`|rFoKf7ieaa	I'm not sure, but I seriously doubt it. If he came forward to claim parental rights he would be arrested for the rape and probably deemed unfit to raise the child.|`|yv5c8szoaa	no. He has no parental rights. It was rape. Now if she puts his name on the birth certificate then he has the same rights as her.|`|74a417146faf42280712b0e2339fd3b7aa	Yes, he may claim as per some countries law. But if she asks for costs now, certainly he would deny now. And this may be kept as his denial record to avoid future claims.|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	He legally could...but if the girl knows who raped her then why isnt she trying to have him put in jail...that way he couldnt bother her OR her baby.|`|vbAu5SY3aa	I think he has to pay child support, but may not have visitation rights.|`|y6I1f78gaa	Hell no! He raped her.|`|vQrDQ1ovaa	well to be honest in today's world yes he most likely would. it really is a sad world|`|KPYQwyeraa	hard decision that would have to be up to the judge i would hope not<br>  ~cat
kqC6OiP2aa	On my hyper days, I'm like that. lol it's hilarious though, but I feel really stupid. I was laughing so much one day that my English teacher told me not to go to a hospital, because I'd laugh at the sick people or something. lol No, you're normal and you sound like fun!|`|NJv2zKxnaa	I do too. I laugh at things that happened...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  a few weeks ago. :]<br>  <br>  Don't worry. But I would take school seriously. Don't think its funny because you WONT be laughing when you are in some tiny house, with a bunch of kids and jobless and a stupid husband who almost barely makes enough money for food.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Nerves maybe. It seems to happen when you are put on the spot.|`|oem5yEUDaa	Yes, you are the only one in the whole world.|`|euN3ct9oaa	I did the same thing. I think it has a lot to do with you being nervous or scared, put on the spot, etc. It could be something really small or huge and I'd laugh and giggle. It makes a lot of people mad. You just have to catch yourself and start learning how to hide that. |`|Rjx799Qaaa	there aren't many people who can't take life seriously... some Greek philosophers called it ataxaria and considered it a goal to be reached...<br>  <br>  eh I personally am that way.

cJQL64ylaa	I have an Out 'n' About Nipper 360 (for our twins, not different ages) and I just love it.  It's a 3 wheeler and is pretty light for a double side by side, although isn't an umbrella fold, so doesn't fold up as small as some others.  The seats are operated independently so it's good for a toddler and a newborn, and for a side by side it is quite narrow, so fits through MOST standard doors (but not all)  <br>  <br>  My twins are only 5 months old, but I have friends with toddlers who also love their Nipper, so I'm pretty sure it will be good for a newborn and a toddler.  The front wheel turns through 360 degrees (but can be locked straight if you need to) so it can just turn on the spot which makes it great for trying to negotiate shops etc...  The only own side I have heard about is that the rain cover isn't too great for a toddler, but Out 'n' About might have addressed that so it may be worth asking about a bit...<br>  <br>  The other one that friends of mine like is the Mountain Buggy, I don't know much about it but it's a side by side and they love it.<br>  <br>  Nic x
CdJtH0xdaa	I was bullied a lot in high school. It was more of an emotional bullying, rather than physical, but I was definitely bullied. It helped me become more passive of what people say. I do, however, get angry or upset when someone says something about me or my wife or my son, or how I'm irresponsible, because I'm not as used to getting called "a bad father", as I've been a father for three-weeks.|`|HQPwwntfaa	A little. Nothing too serious though. <br>  <br>  It was just normal stuff. Boys made fun of how I looked, people made fun of me for being emo (I was really emo when I was younger.)<br>  <br>  Then last year there were a bunch of mean seniors in a class I had.|`|baEs4ZcJaa	I'm 13; and I haven't been bullied. But If I see someone being bullied, I stand up for them. I'm an outgoing person so I am not afraid to tell someone to stop or tell them to stop acting like a wh*re.|`|FVPOxaeJaa	Apparently I'm being bullied at school. I was told that by some answerers on Y!A. I just thought I was being harassed. I'm a teen. I ignore them. It does really affect me, it just annoys me.|`|LSkeAPBIaa	My brother was bullied until he commit suicide because of it. I don't take **** from any one and I don't put  up with bullying even if it's not me being the one that is getting bullied|`|Kwdro7Swaa	Everyone gets teased the best thing to do about it is tell the teacher, principal and guidance counselor.|`|yFYFSjwcaa	Yes i was in 8th grade.<br>  <br>  I didn't handle it i  was always on the run in 8th grade sadly.|`|o0Q7LmMsaa	i wouldn't consider it bullying, it was more so annoying than bullying<br>  basically there was these idiot guys that would do the most annoying things to me the stuff that they did was very imature  and stupid. <br>  i'm not sure if it was planned, but they did it everyday<br>  i got very annoyed by it, and i found out from other people<br>  and i was told that, the boys, told each other to do that to me everyday.<br>  i didn't really do anything about it, i'll admit at times i would laugh at what they did, not because i thought it was funny, i just didn't know what to do and laughing was the only thing i delt with it for over a year, but it really did aggravate me a lot.<br>  it wasn't only me they did that to, it was to a few other people i know also<br>  but in general anytime i see someone is getting bullied i always stand up for them, bullying isn't right|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	I was bullied in elementary school. Not like beat up but made fun and teased. :S It made me upset a lot but I never told anyone. I didn't know I COULD tell anyone. The only people who knew were my best friends at school. Despite us being so young, they still were able to comfort me. :)<br>  <br>  I recently spoke with my mom about bullying and stuff and then told her about how it was for me when I was little and she said she never had ANY idea. :/<br>  <br>  It affected a bit, I'd say. I'm still worried people are saying things about me behind my back and all of that stuff... I guess I'm just very paranoid and overly worried now. :S Oh, and i'm in tenth grade now. :P|`|2QvIM81Haa	Umm.. in like grades k-2? <br>  <br>  I told my older cousin, my mom and my grandma.<br>  <br>  When I got home sometimes I cried.. but after my cousin, mom and grandma gave me the advice to stand up to her, she stopped :)<br>  <br>  I think she was really mean.. I mean she was in grade 4 when I was in kindergarten and she picked on me up until grade 2, wow, now that I think of it, she was a bitchhh picking on a little kid!|`|ozATw7s0aa	I'm 14 now. No, I don't think I was. There were some kids that were, though, one I remember specifically. He was a little overweight, and as soon as I was old enough to realize what people were saying to him, I talked to him and was nice to him. I should have stuck up for him more, though.|`|m5Qh7gYraa	I was bullied in 4th grade.<br>  I used to be an outgoing person. <br>  <br>  After that I became a really shy person. <br>  <br>  I still am a shy person and I'm in college now.<br>  <br>  Girls can be so cruel.
GGH0HVdvaa	chances are always 50/50, there's no way to tell with your symptoms. best of luck that it's a girl!|`|DcLiW4bbaa	Lets consult the magic 8-ball!<br>  <br>  *shakes 8-ball* Will it be a girl this time?<br>  <br>  No way!<br>  <br>  :(<br>  <br>  You should try for yourself, maybe that will help, lol.

How far along are you? 'Bout 20 weeks (give or take) you can find out for sure, try not to go stir crazy before then. Hope your boys are excited!|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Girl sperm live longer but swim slower than Boy sperm. If you think you had sex 4 or 5 days before you ovulated then your chances of having a girl may be higher. Good luck<br>  <br>  Male sperm swim faster and die quicker (2-3 days), while female sperm swim slower and die last (3-5 days).
f4doqdSCaa	Well, just try to relax, first of all. Maybe you could try wearing looser clothes, so you don't have any pressure on the area. My best friend didn't like having any tight clothes around her tummy when she was pregnant. Maybe you could speak to your doctor to get some ideas, he might suggest some things to help you feel better and more 'ready', like some light stretching or swimming exercises. If you're really worried that something is wrong, you should contact your OB. I think you just need to go with it, every pregnancy is different. Good luck and congratulations to you!|`|ZcV4zmpxaa	Well you know it's better to have a kid when your younger since you have more energy to handle this. This is normal, so what I am guessing that 8 years ago you had lots of energy or was fit. People who are averagely fit usually have it easier when pregnant. And have a merry Christmas too.|`|qfNK5aDEaa	Its normal because I am 21 weeks pregnant and the same thing is happening to me..It has for a couple of weeks now..|`|9db09958436c7b40d03884884294b2c0aa	aww... just let it be.<br>  there is nothing u can do anyways.<br>  all pregnancies are different and just stay close to the potty.<br>  <br>  |`|UXRwYHrMaa	You are almost out of the window of trouble. I wouldnt think the tightness is anything to be concerned about. I had it myself and now I'm 26 weeks. Plus that you describe it as a little bothersome probably means it is well within the range of normal bodily twitches that pregnant women feel. The lit from my OB and the books I've got all say that discomforts are normal, but anything in the range of 'extreme pain' should be reported immediately.|`|xmVGViPiaa	There isn't really much I can tell you except that this is normal and it's only going to get worse as you get bigger.  You can try a maternity belt, which will lift up your belly and may relieve some of the pressure on your bladder, but other than that I think this is just something you're going to have to live with for the next few months.  It'll go by so fast though ;)|`|syUhfkK4aa	If it hurts worse when you need to pee, I think this could be pressure on your bladder from the baby.  Think about it.  You have a human being in you growing and it's moving all of your organs around to make room.  If you haven't talked to your Doctor, I'd advise you do so ASAP to be safe.  |`|7TYuCafDaa	Relax. Your baby is fine and the pressure is completely normal. To relieve the discomfort some you could try taking a warm bath and reclining in the tub to take the pressure off your bladder. This always works for me.|`|sXKxefqQaa	i went through the same thing when i was pregnant and i went to the ER i don't know how many times and every-time i was told that it was normal and that my body was going through some changes. But Good Luck.|`|4p9sBdyTaa	That tightness you are feeling is from the stretching uterus. It is perfectly normal and a sign that all is well. Congrats: ) I am 13 weeks with my second child and they will be 7 years apart.|`|zw0w4y5taa	it's pretty normal... i think<br>  |`|QbInovNDaa	Tightness is fine, its because now your uterus is starting to grow. I didn't know I was pregnant until week 12. Your stomach is really starting to stretch and the skin around it. But it you start to get bad cramping then go to the doctor right away, that was my mistake. Everythings fine I would assume, its just going to take you a while to get used to. Some of the pants you wear will probably make you very uncomfortable as well, its just trial and error.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck <3<br>  Use lots of coco-butter|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	Fairly normal. At 11 weeks your uterus is putting pressure on your bladder. You wil be more susceptible to UTIs right now. It will pass as your uterus enlarges further only to begin again towards the end of your pregnancy.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	have you talked to your doctor about this? i remember some tightness and uncomfortableness early out but it wasnt as bad as yours is seeming to be. good luck. 
MJDjaNtDaa	That's what I heard at my school, but didn't believe it because it's high school. This whole story is so confusing!!|`|gDEFlWnOaa	None of that is true, sa far as I know.|`|ameJkDgpaa	the truth is nobody really knows what happened because nobody was there to witness what happened. as far as i'm concerned i don't think she gave him herpes|`|MvzrzDSNaa	I really dont think so. I think they just got into a fight like couples do and the media took it way too far|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Not sure who those people are but what business is it of anyone else's?|`|wqrZomw4aa	lieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee|`|wXOoNwvuaa	its prob. a rumor started by the media. the media loves that kinda stuff, makes it more interesting, makes more people wanta read about the story. the truth will come out eventually, you just have to wait.|`|LQ7rROMSaa	Rihanna didn't give Chris herpes, Chris didn't give Rihanna herpes.|`|kCwFm2uMaa	Okay so, the only thing anybody knows for sure is, Chris beat up Rhianna.<br>  Now the herpes thing, probably just another one of those money making rumors!|`|K0NCjN7Jaa	Yeah its true.

My school gets out at 2:50. :P|`|yB8djbeNaa	wow 2:28 your serious.... when i was at school we used to have to always stay till 3:15 (im only 22!) i really wouldnt be that bothered it is your childs education at stake here....<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  1:43 thats just crazy what time do you start.... <br>  <br>  we used to have to be in school for 8:45 and finished at 3:15 (got with a 15 min break in morning and a lunch break)<br>  <br>  i wouldnt worry you need to learn!<br>  <br>  im in the UK|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	uh no. my school starts at 7:15 and ends at 2:24. not that big of a deal. what you go to school for how long usually?<br>  <br>  EDIT: you go to school for 6 1/2 hours? Wow I go to school for 7 1/2 almost 8 hours. Yet again my school district is in the top 5 of the best in the counrty.|`|sMuMfuAgaa	I get out of school at 3:01 every single day and you're worried about stay until 2:28? I don't think its that big of a problem but I do think it'd be lame if they're doing that because of snow days.|`|G7g85k0Laa	Half 2!! Your so lucky! Im in my first year of college but we didnt finish school till 3:35 last year. You should be grateful for getting to finish that early. 1:43 is basically a half day|`|emkT1a6raa	I'm in NY.

f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	been there....kids..haha... i took mine apart (took the battery out) and  laid it on the counter and  laid the hair dryer beside it and let it blow on it,,,far enough away as to not overheat it, but close enough to dry it out. it worked, i didnt know about the rice thing at the time.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	The rice aborbs the water very nicely.<br>  It's what I was going to recommend.Turn it off, take batteries out,and leave it in the uncooked rice for 24 hours at least. Do not turn it on if you think there is any moisture left in it. Doesn't work all the time, but it  does often. I've had phones go for a swim in a lake and work again with this trick.|`|lxAaEMg5aa	Step1<br>  Get it out of the water as soon as possible. The skin on it may be tight but it can only protect for about 20 seconds. So hurry and get it out.<br>  Step2<br>  Remove the battery. This is the most important part. Remember that water and electricity don't mix. Some circuits can survive water, but only if the electricity is cut off from them.<br>  Step3<br>  Remove your SIM card. This is important because you can save all your information and contacts. Sim cards can survive water but you have to act quickly. Pat it dry. Do not heat it up. Also some phones do not use SIM cards.<br>  Step4<br>  Dry Phone as much as possible. You can use towels or paper towels. You can also put it in a bowl of rice or put it with some silica gel packs to draw out some of the water. You can also sit the phone on top of a cable box, this will dry it with the heat radiating from it. And as tempting as it may be leave it alone and let it dry for 2 to 3 days<br>  Step5<br>  After you have waited for your phone to dry. Once everything looks dry put your battery back in and try to turn it on. If it doesn't turn on try plugging it in to the charger without the battery. If this works you just need a new battery. If this doesn't work try it again in a few days. If after that it still doesn't work take it to an authorized dealer. Sometimes they can fix it.|`|mxWlNykzaa	okay i found this works .. PUT THE PHNE IN A JAR WITH RICE PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WHOLE JAR OF RICE|`|7N0sY0pLaa	I would just buy a new one. They're cheap.. somtimes..
Y6K9jwXzaa	the swings that are closer to the ground are better for traveling. like from room to room or to grandma's house or whatever. they're called take-along swings. the bigger swings are better if you don't plan on moving it too much. they are not out of date. it's better especially if you have a dog so it won't mess with the baby. <br>  <br>  it's better not to have the bumpers and blankets. they can suffocate the baby. they can get their face up against the bumper or get trapped between it and the crib bars. the blanket can get pulled up over their head and they can't get it off. the baby will be plenty comfortable without them. babies can over heat which can also cause SIDS. <br>  <br>  if you're going to get a bumper get one that's mesh material. they have them at stores like babies r us. they also have these things called sleep sacks that are basically wearable blankets. also sold at babies r us.|`|azrKKNfTaa	I have a tall swing and a short swing. there is really no difference. I can put the short one on the floor or on the table but the tall one is nice because if im sitting on the couch she is at the same level as me. When you do buy one though make sure it plugs in doesnt just use batteries because they go through them really fast!!<br>  <br>  As for the bumpers I figure she isn't moving around so she doesn't need them. and if your worried about blankets just put her/him in a warm sleeper and maybe put a small heater fan in the room so they are warm.<br>  Honestly i think the real way to prevent sids is to not leave an infant alone for a long period of time. but im one of those bad moms that let my baby girl sleep in bed with us which is also a big no no|`|etwhvalhaa	i dont know what swing thing u are talkin about... but i got bumpers and blankets for my son from birth, it probably happened to a baby once or twice so now as a safety preacaution they tell u not to use them.|`|hWe8vhKKaa	i have a small swing there no difference between big/small swings. you do what you feel comfortable for your baby if you don't want bumpres on your baby crib then ddon't.dont listen to others . trust your instincts|`|9ozDCTDTaa	I have a large dog, so I got the higher swing.  The only difference between the two is the ability to travel with them.  My friend got the one closer to the ground and she can easily take it with her when she is going to her mom's for an extended stay.  But I like my higher one so the dog isn't licking her in the face.  I also like the taller one because now that she is a little older, she loves sitting in it and looking out our windows.  As far as blankets and bumpers.  I had a bumper in her crib until she started rolling around and kept pulling on it.  I used sleeper blankets until she was 8 months, then started using a regular baby blanket.

It may be a faint positive, but I'm inclined to say it's negative. Doesn't mean it won't turn into a positive. HCG increases substantially in just a couple of days, so you may want to wait 2 days and retest.<br>  <br>  I hope it's positive! Good luck!!!|`|tht0DrHsaa	It looks like there may be a line there. I would do another one with first morning urine and see what it says.  Good luck
yQWnMSc6aa	I never had it. Don't wish for it. I've seen women with it and it doesn't look fun. If you are worried that it is a sign your pregnancy isn't "strong" and you are more prone to miscarriage my doctor said there are no studies linking morning sickness to a decreased rate of miscarriage over any other pregnancy symptom. <br>  <br>  The average onset is 6 weeks. You aren't even that yet. You still could get it.|`|xmVGViPiaa	Not everyone has morning sickness and some people who have it are lucky and get very little of it.  Then again you are still very early on in your pregnancy, you have the next 8 months to be sick.  My morning sickness really picked up in the middle of my 6th week, and others I know didn't pick up til their 8th week.... And you may just be lucky and not really get morning sickness.  Enjoy yourself :)|`|TFdhL7LKaa	Everyone is different. Some people get really ill through out their whole pregnancy and some don't get a thing! Morning sickness usually doesn't really hit you until week 6 (and usually goes around week 12.) If you don't get sick its not a bad sign or anything - just thank your stars that you are one of the luckey ones =) Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy =)|`|Q6YboW9Daa	It might hit you at 6-8 weeks and trust me if it does, you will wish you could go back to the lovely morning sickness free days.  I had it starting at 3.5 weeks but it reached a whole new level around 7 weeks.  My friend, on the other hand, had horrible morning sickness with her first 3 pregnancies and has absolutely NONE with hers now.  Everyones different =]  Relax and enjoy that you can still eat!|`|mFQydvncaa	hey girl  i am 6 weeks and 3 days pregnant and i feel the same i have only thrown up one time and i have been a little nauseated some but only if i get real hot, and certain smells.  i know with my first child i was super sick! so if this is all i get i am going to be so happy!! well goodluck and if you want to chat we could be pregnant biddis my estimated due date is 7-11-09 !! take care|`|NrqQRVVaaa	No, although it is normal to have morning sickness it is not expected. Some people have morning sickness and others dont, just be lucky you dont have it then. :]|`|lgfFL7Tlaa	I have two children and I did not get morning sickness with either pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Everyone is different and every experience is different.|`|2a8012f3fab7d5dacda2e659af94e84faa	not everyone has Morning sickness be happy|`|k2heQRKFaa	well mine didnt start till I was 6.5 weeks pregnant. so maybe it will be coming on soon or maybe you will be o so lucky and not have much m/s... |`|C0GeEv7kaa	Not every woman gets nauseated. BE THANKFUL! I was miserable during my first trimester. Just because another woman has a symptom doesn't mean you will. |`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Some people don't have it at all and others don't have your classic morning sickness.  I was only sick a few times and it was usually because I was hungry.  If I didn't feed myself immediately after waking up, I would get nauseous.|`|whYlVR2saa	every woman is different during pregnancy. for instance, my mother only got morning sickness with her three pregnancies for one day. with all of us! if you are worried just give your doctor a call. im sure it is fine. hope this helped!|`|eemmWU0Haa	everythings alright you don't have to freak my sister was just nausea, but not every day. Good luck|`|rBq189W1aa	Not necessarily. Sounds like you're one of the lucky ones.
Zy07f0Zwaa	I was very nervous before my morphology scan too =] It is such a daunting but AMAZING experience. Although it is easier said than done try not to stress about it and just think of how great it is going to be to see your bub moving about and being a pain in the *** for the sonographer haha =] Once it is all over and done with you will wonder why you were worried. The check is very thorough and if there was an issue your doctor would contact you straight away!!<br>  <br>  Good luck, everything will be great xx <br>  <br>  EDIT: I am 22 weeks pregnant, I am not a big girl at all and I have only just started feeling my bub move =] Chances are he/she is in there moving around but you can't feel it it because they have tonnes of room at this point, if you are active then this also can play a role and if this is your first then we don't know what to feel so it can be confusing =] <br>  <br>  xx|`|xmVGViPiaa	It's normal to be nervous.  I was really nervous before mine too.  I'm sure you will do fine, and your baby will probably be fine.  They'll just do a bunch of measurements, look at baby's heart, tell you the gender, etc etc... It takes about a half an hour and then you are done and usually you have pics of your baby afterwards!  <br>  If it's your first pregnancy it may not be abnormal for you not to feel your baby at 20 weeks.  It may take you longer.... You can try drinking something really cold like ice water or juice and eating something sweet and laying on your side - you may be able to feel baby then, it will probably feel like tickling/tingling in your abdomen or even popping if baby is strong enough to kick.|`|u7wrXqOZaa	Calm down.  Sit down and relax.  At 20 weeks I felt little flutters here and there, but nothing to make me say "Oh I'm pregnant."  My lower abdomen felt tight and I could start to feel my pelvis move.  Weird I know but I could.  It all depends on your body.  We are all different and we all experience different things.  As long as you are not feeling any pain, your able to go on with your day like normal, I would not worry too much about something being wrong.   Have fun.|`|K24z2fHDaa	I'm mother of 3 beautiful daughters. I understand your nervousness but truly its the last time you see baby before its born so enjoy it. Turn your nervousness into excitement and have a long loving look. Its natural to worry but no matter what the sonographer says its still your baby and you'll love it regardless.<br>  Have fun and enjoy, God help me I'm feeling broody.<br>  
siDcjgJCaa	So i am extremly lucky and I have a WONDERFUL support system. Both my mother and my MIL are great with the baby. I fully trust them. As well as my little sister, she is 20 and SO in love with my daughter.. she is great with her.. anyways... My weird mommy thing is that when we are with my family and the baby needs to be changed, or fed, or played with or is just generally fussy I always feel the need to do it myself. Although other family members offer, I always feel guilty for having other do things that are my "job". The reason is I have an Aunt who's children are 7,5 and 3 she is constantly pushing her children off on other people and I hear the rest of our family talking about how awful that is... I dont want to be her and take advantage of our family so I make sure to take care of my own child... <br>  <br>  I also check her breathing like 20 times a night.. i am terrified of SIDS... one night when she was about 3 months old, I got so paranoid I stayed up all night checking her breathing, making sure she was alive!|`|T8CR3u02aa	We are trying to get our 4 month old daughter to take a bottle so I can go back to school in January. My husbands approach is to let her starve until she takes the bottle. He will let her cry and cry. She will cry to the point of falling asleep. I just can't do that. I can't let her cry. Needless to say...she is still not taking a bottle.   :(<br>  <br>  They say to leave the house so she can not smell me, then she will take a bottle. But I can't leave if I think she is going to be miserable. What a viscous circle!!!!|`|nbSp469Waa	I'm like you I don't like to leave my 3 month old with anyone.  The only time I have is when we took our 2 older kids hiking, and I was even calling my mom everytime I had a signal.<br>  <br>  The one thing I do that I know is stupid of me because it scares me, I read all the horrible stories on when mom's find their infants dead from SIDS.  It's so bad, that I set my alarm to go off every 3 hours so I can check on my daughter.  And she is next to me all day long.|`|tDb3osk7aa	lol u sound like me some when i do decide to leave my son with someone im all the time calling to check up on him lol....I also feel like im naked with out him im so used to carring him everywhere i go...but i do and have left him with my mom, and my sister in law that just loves and spoiles him to death when she is around i dont have a baby lol but that does give me a break while she holds and plays with him i get to relax and just chill and watch....u need to learn to let loose just a little more leave him a couple more times with the in law which i wish i had my hubbys mom has passed and i cry to think about not having her around....i trust my mom and would have trusted his too cause they raised us and we turned out just fine so mabey u need to trust in ur inlaws a little more cause if u dont u will go crazy if u cant get out or just lay down and relax once in a while..i have not gone back to work full time but only once in a while when im needed i do go in on a weekend and let daddy keep the baby so they can have some man time together lol and it does feel so good to get out of the house and do something that makes me feel like a normal person again but dont get me wrong im calling all day lol to check up on him and i cant wait to get back to him all rested up from the crying and screaming and ready to get back to it calmer and more in control of my emotions u need it too trust me it helps cause i know the baby can drive u nuts sometimes mine sure does...Good luck and i hope u can put some trust in someone soon u need a break if only for more than 2 hours lol have a lunch date with some girlfriends or just go window shopping...|`|jNtkhOTVaa	I sooooo relate!  My son is almost 5 months old and I've left him with his father maybe once or twice just long enough to run into the doctor myself and that was only for about an hour.<br>  <br>  The only people I would allow to watch him are close family members but everyone is an hour away from me in either direction so even if they were to babysit it completely defeats the purpose because I would either have to find something to do in their town or drive all the way back to where I live to get a little sleep or catch up on a messy house that will just never ever be clean again.<br>  <br>  The only way I get any sleep is to put my son in bed with me when my husband goes to work and snuggle with him then.  He'll sleep for a few hours and then when he wakes up I am right there to breast feed.<br>  <br>  I too should let someone babysit my son.  Like right now, my husband has been left in the living room to watch him.  But every single time he cries I cringe and have to stop myself from running in there.  I have to remind myself that my husband is perfectly capable...  or at least I hope he is.<br>  <br>  I feel for you!  I feel for me too!  LOL|`|M6c0hUefaa	Don't worry I feel the same way.<br>  <br>  I was on my way somewhere by "myself" and I was out of my neighborhood, on the highway, only to turn around to go get my daughter.<br>  <br>  Ugh, there went that day alone, but I was just thinking of everything that could've gone wrong..Is she gonna fall off the bed? Omg, she could choke on something..What if she misses me..? etc.<br>  <br>  She's almost 8 months old and I'm still working on not feeling so anxious when I leave her.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I have 3 special needs children that no one will be able to handle without paying for respite care so I don't go out at all.  Its been 8 years...  You get used to it after awhile.  Plus I am aspie and don't like to socialize anyways but I do like to go out to eat occasionally.

Hands down.<br>  <br>  Keira sounds dated, and reminds me of Keira Knightly. (Sp?)<br>  Kiara sounds a bit ghetto, and trashy.<br>  Keely is a name that never grows up. <br>  Carina has elegance, poise, beauty, and will grow up with the daughter.<br>  <br>  As for Kaelin, I'd prefer the original spelling: Cailin. Perhaps Cailen. I think that Kaelin looks trashy, (just looks -- I think it's a beautiful-sounding name.) I don't think that Kayla and Cailin / Cailen are too similar at all! Especially with the revised spelling; you can barely tell they're alike.<br>  <br>  I think that Carina Lynn and Cailin / Cailen Eve are wonderful options.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and congrats!<br>  ~Emily-Maria|`|JCVLLV51aa	Kiara Lynn Vo<br>  i chose Kiara cuz its fun to say, it just rolls off your tongue and its so unique lol<br>  and Lynn is my middle name =]<br>  <br>  haha im MiMi Lynn =]|`|z4blIUneaa	Carina Paige<br>  Carina Ainsley<br>  Carina Raine<br>  Carina Michelle<br>  Carina Joyce|`|PgOWFjNBaa	Kaelin (kay-LIN) Eve<br>  <br>  In my opinion that name is beautiful. :]|`|4863f8dd77952e57a9c03006243c12c6aa	Keira|`|541ni2a9aa	those are all horrible, please rethink your names. all tacky and gross.|`|l4gqo2LBaa	Keely (Keelea)<br>  <br>  Keely Sada Vo|`|OtqB24NVaa	Keely Shae|`|VMCBNNlzaa	Carina Elisabeth<br>  <br>  Carina is a beautiful name and I like Elisabeth with it.

2QpCk8V8aa	It's a personal thing isn't it?<br>  When ever you and your partner feel ready, and when you realize you can handle it and that it's what you want.<br>  the average age is probably like 27 maybe?<br>  I think that's pretty good.<br>  I hate teen pregnancies, kids having kids.|`|tazfv89qaa	It depends on how many children you want.  If you are going for the one, then 30-34 is a nice age frame because you've had your 20s to do stuff just for you -- travel, date a lot, work on your career, stay out late, etc.  Once you have a baby, it's not about you anymore.  So enjoy your  twenties and you'll enjoy having a child in your 30s even more because you've gotten a lot of stuff out of your system.  I think slightly older moms have better perspective too and can enjoy each moment with their baby perhaps a little better than a young mom who may be more overwhelmed because she's less established.|`|lPNP9bt2aa	when you are with the right man<br>  and when you both are able to bring it|`|y7Ta8dYGaa	23 to 30 is a good age. but you should have babies until you can afford them!|`|QLopvWKDaa	I do not think that there is a perfect age- but it takes the ability to support the baby financially and emotionally.<br>  <br>  I feel lucky, because in my early 20"s I went to college, traveled around the USA and relocated by myself to California and then Dallas, TX.<br>  <br>  During this time I had a blast, met allot of people and went through some experiences- Good and bad- Then I had my first baby at 28 my second at 31. The coolest thing I ever did!<br>  <br>  But now I am only 50- I have two full grown children and am young and healthy enough to do what ever I please. Maybe travel...relocate somewhere fun...open my own shop or sit my butt on the beach!<br>  <br>   So to me, I got all the goodies at both ends of my life and a very full, emotionally enriching middle!|`|eMXIQaQlaa	I guess it depends on a persons body. I would say between 20-35.|`|ZUk6435maa	thirtysomething|`|39pl2Dotaa	i think 24 to 26 is a great age you dont want it to old :-)|`|ihjEAoKRaa	I'm waiting until I'm 30.  I want to have had a chance to do a lot of things that I want to do, like travel, work, have little responsibility.  I've been with my husband for 7 years already.  I'd like to have a couple more before we complicate our lives with children.<br>  I'm looking forward to being a mother.  Just not right now.|`|afW58le8aa	It varies for different people.  I'd say when you are done with school and and very secure in your relationship.  That could be 21 or 35 for some.  I had my first at 25 and am expecting #2 4 months before I turn 28.  That was perfect for me and for my husband.  We had financial security, good jobs and a wonderful marriage.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I had my 1st at 23, 2nd at 25, 3rd at 27.

I feel this was the right age for me it's not right for some...I feel the perfect age to have a child is when you can love and support a baby and most importantly be mature enough realize that your baby's needs surpass yours or anyones...But this is just me age is just a number there is no perfect age! :)|`|jaAolejUaa	according to experts as i ahve read it's 20-30, your body can still cope w/ whatever it has to during pregnancy on these ages.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	If you are financially stable and in a committed relationship, than any time is great. From a purely biological standpoint, you are less likely to have complications before you are 30, but medical science says that the ideal child bearing years are between 18 and 24. My husband and I started at 25 so that the kids are out of the house and out of university by early retirement age :)|`|tZt7fUYYaa	26  just cos thats my age when i gave birth in december and its good for me|`|mimykKnhaa	I would say at earliest 25, but personally I want to be late twenties. Everyone is different, but by then most women are mature enough to raise a child, and stable enough to support one.|`|69DjSUVAaa	I think 25 would be a good age, i had just had my first one at the age of 28, and wish i had had him sooner. x|`|EnKFZ7Roaa	whenever u are mentally and financially stable.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	26<br>  that way you've had some of your fun<br>  but thats just my opinion<br>  my parents had me when they were 30-ish|`|nAOlBmzDaa	whatever age you are when you are MARRIED and mature enough to have a baby. <br>  for some that may be-21 and for others it may be 35... just depends<br>  <br>  every baby deserves a mom and a dad... period...|`|AA11100518	i would say probably 28 or 29|`|96mkEwkwaa	the perfect age is when you're married, and can financially support a child. i've just been going thru hell not being married and my daughter having a deadbeat for a dad.|`|kUqTYPSkaa	In your 20's when your married and you and your husband have a job to support the child, you want to be prepared.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Nothing is perfect, including an age to have a baby.|`|gUnoQme8aa	for some reason when ever i ask a girl they always say twenty three don't know about perfect but it is a popular age`|`|U25RAqyoaa	25-30 you are old enough to be responsible but young enough to still play with them.|`|0l027sJxaa	When you feel your ready. I'm 18 & a have a little girl. don't wait too long cuz you don't wanna be an old mommy. ewww.|`|7cjqT33Baa	I don't think there is a perfect age...it just depends on the maturity level of the parents-to-be.  And maturity comes at all different ages.  When you reach age when your concern  shifts to what you can give the baby instead of what the baby can do for you.  Because the job of the parent is to provide for that baby and make sure they are healthy in all ways.  <br>  We chose to wait until our 30's for those reasons.|`|XG0EljaKaa	i dont this the "perfect" age exists. iam 21 and im 11weeks pregnant at the moment. its not idealy when i wanted to have a child but im happy about it. been with my boyfriend for 5 year so we are both very happy but didnt plan it. <br>  i suppose its when you and your partner feel ready. but how ready can yopu actually be?|`|cl83KGQoaa	dont have a baby till you are at least over 9000 years old|`|GNgp759Yaa	as long as your ready, financially supported, have somwhere to live then i guess its ok. im 17 and expecting my 1st it was an accident as i fell on the pill, if i could go back i would of had the injection or coil to prevent things from happening so young but i would never consider getting rid of my baby girl now, i am supported, live in a house and still go to college|`|SnoKfIKOaa	When you have a house, a job, a steady partner who loves and respects you, and your emotionally educated and well in yourself. That can be at any age, but normally comes from mid 20's onwards for a woman and about 29-30 for a man!!|`|nvkTBThAaa	There is no perfect age.  My number 1 requirement for having a baby is having a committed partner who will take care of your child with you.  You also have to be financially secure, etc.  I would say anything over 20 if you feel ready.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	there is never a perfect age, its when YOU BOTH feel ready|`|dDVAUA9saa	There is no perfect age.  Whenever the parents are financially, mentally and emotionally ready.  Okay, and somewhere between the ages of 20 and 45.|`|AA11945637	never|`|75l2smfCaa	Whenever you feel it is right for you to have a baby. Only the person having the child will know. Everyone has different situations at different times.|`|mXtsmTdaaa	Nothing is perfect but I would wait until you are in a stable relationship have a good job and a home.  I am 27 and I am finally ready.|`|em8A42Bqaa	When you have accomplished most of the things that you want to accomplish.  <br>  <br>  Late 20's after marriage definitely or a REAL serious committed relationship b/c you will need them trust me!|`|olMVfnljaa	Whatever age you think is the right time for you... I don't reccomend having a baby from 12-20 years though... It would probably take up your social life! But I love babies :)|`|AZv0ON1Laa	25 because at this age your body is fully developed.

Im 17 weeks pregnant.<br>  <br>  I think that is just one of the things they try to scare you out of having.|`|5h8bYsKdaa	ive had 4 kids and i ate subway all the time. my kids are fine. they say not to eat at buffets and subway because the food sits out alot. it has a small fridge and keeps it cool.<br>  <br>  i think its stupid. your baby is going to be fine.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	I eat them and so far everything is ok. Just try to make sure the meat gets heated up to kill the bacteria. BTW: My sisters and my mom ate lunch meat throughout their pregnancies and everything turned out fine.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	it is because of the possibility of listeria from not cooked  lunch meats but if you didn't get sick you should be fine just don't eat them anymore|`|apALY0sqaa	There is a chance for listeria if you eat deli meats- as well as anything unpasturized. Avoid soft cheeses and anything that hasn't been properly pasturized- usually imported foods and drinks is where this would be common.<br>  <br>  I ate Subway constantly with my first and have eaten a fair share with this baby as well. My 4 year old is very healthy and has been her whole life! This baby is fantastically and disgustingly healthy so far and I am certain will stay that way. If you are worried about it, ask the sub shop to microwave the meat- only takes about 15 seconds, or get the whole sandwich toasted. <br>  <br>  And, all in all, Subway has to comply with some really strict health codes- so getting sick there is gonna be pretty hard to do. they have to change the veggies and meats out based on time, and the table they sit in is refrigerated to keep everything cool and in the range of heathly temperatures.<br>  <br>  Listen to your gut and your dr. If the dr says baby is safe, and you don't feel sick after eating, don't sorry about it. You could make yourself sick worrying about it, and that could do more damage that the deli meat itself! I would avoid the unpasturized stuff though- most American digestive tracts aren't used that kind of fare. Europeans eat that way often, and does little if any damage to their babies, you baby might not fair so well!!!!! Good luck!!!!
vN4v4fR2aa	my roommate, who never used soap when he showered or washed his clothing was the bane of my existence during my first trimester. That was the one smell that would instantly make me throw up (the others I'd at least have 30 min to try to settle my stomach). <br>  <br>  On top of that, I developed a milk protein allergy during my first trimester, so anything I ate that had milk that wasn't mixed and cooked with something else would make me sick. Partially digested milk is not a pleasant thing to be upchucking :(|`|yo9XNz61aa	Vanilla.....its not as bad now but def in my first trimester I couldnt be around anything that had vanilla in it!  I went thru so many prenatal vitamans b/c they all had a vanilla smell to them and I couldnt even open the bottle or I got sick!  My mom had to switch out her trash bags b/c they smelled like vanilla and I got sick when I came to visit!  Also the smell of curry and anything pretty much chinese!|`|ZhQh57dZaa	It depends, If I have eaten, then everything makes me sick.  Thinking about eating makes me wanna throw up.  Cooking makes me sick.  I was chopping raw meat and I got sick.  I was mashing beans and I got sick.  Hmmm.  Taking out the trash-that doesnt smell- makes me sick.  The smell of fast food makes me sick.|`|dy34Qyugaa	I went to a chinese buffet and they had soup that I swear smelled like rotting chicken.<br>  <br>  It doesn't seem to be just one thing  - it is everything.  Sometimes a turkey and brie sandwich sounds good.  Other times, I just think of it and want to vomit.<br>  <br>  This morning I thought about tea and had to run to the bathroom, heaving violently the whole way.<br>  <br>  I sure hope I grow out of THIS stage soon!|`|lYjLrqzOaa	Can you take a different prenatal vitamin? You should thoroughly clean your kitchen to remove any smells that are strong. Does a pregnant woman have heightened sense of smell. <br>  Use a deodorizer and might as well use something antibacterial, can't hurt.|`|BbW5unM8aa	Nothing by looking at it or smelling it. From the beginning of pregnancy till now I haven't been able to eat yogurt, and I love it! So that's been disappointing.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	I use to love the garlic smell, and now it just makes me gag.|`|vz1gmSM7aa	My prenatal pill made me sick.  The only way I could keep it down was to drink milk with it.|`|2npEN1rraa	Ugh, hot pockets and the smell of my prenatal vitamins.  I was having hot pockets or frozen t.v. dinners almost every night for awhile to save money and it was a quick, easy way to make sure I was eating enough throughout the day for my baby.  Now just the thought of frozen dinners makes me feel sick.  Also the smell of my mom's pumpkin flavored chapstick... she wanted me to smell it the other day because she loves it and I almost got sick!  So far I haven't had to spend time over the toilet during this pregnancy just feelings of nauseousness.  Lucky me.  Anyway Congrats!<br>  <br>  Oh!  And yogurt too.  I used to love that stuff but no more...|`|sGJhKesdaa	my husband.. no really he works at a place that packs vitamins, and when he comes home from work he has to get a shower before he can kiss me or i will puke.  and he has to keep his face shaved and his hair short, if not the smell does not come out, and he leaves his shoes in the truck b/c they smell like vitamins too   it really sucks but at least he is paying the bills :)|`|d1lVsiZ8aa	I could NOT eat mushrooms this entire pregnancy, they made me sick...that of course is all i wanted...but I withheld. Then around 16 weeks or so, I could not eat meat. I would throw up instantly. So I was eating cod nuggets while everyone ate chicken nuggets, and then BAM no longer able to eat the cod nuggets!! That finally ended 3 weeks ago...thank god...|`|xcgztBiSaa	Hazelnut spread. Uhg. Actually, everything but fresh fruits make me feel queasy when i think of them. |`|PbI07tXEaa	My husband was putting icy/hot on his legs last night and the smell made me sooooooo sick!!  It's funny what weird things that never used to bother you now have such an effect!|`|264327ecd425fcd4f6d37e37b70b8549aa	Everything but fruits!!!!|`|xmVGViPiaa	Garlic.<br>  I can't stand the stuff.  |`|A1S5KNUkaa	I'm 7 weeks 5 days and all of a sudden I'm smelling things a lot differently.<br>  <br>  My partner bought a bottle of orange lucozade and I went to take a drink (unopened bottle) and I swear it whiffed and tasted of sweat =(  Don't think I'll ever be able to drink it again!  He of course said there was nothing wrong with it.|`|01vMpHkWaa	seafooddd<br>  <br>  <br>  omg ewwwww<br>  <br>  <br>  and mushrooms|`|do1Bz6U0aa	I cant stand the smell of curry and spicy foods, my friend took me out for a meal and i had to leave because she ordered curry and i couldn't stand it!|`|zF4acGKPaa	everything i eat!!! |`|7TrEvyuDaa	ughhhh the smell of peanut butter|`|g5jvbZGVaa	pizza and hot pockets! i usually ate it no prob but now whenever my husband has some i just run off to vomit!
a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	Take a test. It could either be pregnancy or pms|`|hnKRu0jwaa	My AF is not due until the 23rd of this month and my breast are sore and swollen also. i think its cause you may be ovulating now. I started ovulatinging on the 6th and they started getting sore and still are rite now. But if you and partner have benn BD its a good chance you hit it on ovulation time. Good Luck|`|xmVGViPiaa	It may still be too early to test.  I would wait about 4 days before you expect your period and then test.  You could still get a negative then, so keep testing from then until your period is due to come.  I had sensitive sore breasts almost immediately after I conceived and the bloating started within the week and I could not get a positive on a HPT until the day of my missed period.|`|eXAQ3kZRaa	i am ttc, my last period was october 20th...<br>  my boobs have been sore, particularly in certain spots... and they have been so for a few days now but i still think it may be too early to test.<br>  you may be in the same boat... i am (patiently....) awaiting next monday so i can test and be sure (hopefully!)<br>  good luckk!|`|a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	pms and pregnancy symtoms are very similar that why its so difficult to tell until you missed a period. You will have to wait till you are late for @ least a week b4 you test with first morning pee.. No point testing so early when (if pregnant) hcg is too low to be detected.. GL|`|WLB4dy2iaa	take another test! may have been too early to pick up the hcg.<br>  best of luck && baby dust <3
njBI4f6Raa	I say go for it..if it look good and all is well go for it..I would!!!|`|qg3zqIP6aa	WOW - lol, I mean WOW - if your guy was too cheap to go out and buy a new condom, shouldn't it have occured to you that this guy won't exactly be the most helpful come Baby time???<br>  <br>  I really hope so many of these questions are just jokes, I'd hate to think that most of the people in this section are a few fries short of a happy meal....|`|050c099821030e555356835c5971a406aa	The dryer is too high of heat for the rubber, I would not use it.|`|VUcGkWFeaa	yeah i probably would just go buy another one to be safe.<br>  not like they cost a lot.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Bad choice, condoms should not go through extremes in temperature or be exposed to any outside forces (like being in a pants pocket) until use.   Sure it's okay, but not if you want to use it for birth control.|`|aec0a315ba82df417988623b48e5f8b7aa	i personally would not use it, unless you just want to get pregnant.  go buy a new one please|`|xmVGViPiaa	I wouldn't use it because the heat from the dryer could have warped the latex and cause it to be weaker.|`|TPJbEhNBaa	Are you asking if it's okay to use it?  No, don't use it.|`|RgePPcoDaa	its not like condoms cost a fortune just buy some more and dont take the chance|`|TyvyBOKDaa	i wouldn't trust it you should get a new one
ICeSfYSzaa	If it's your period, and you're on the pill, there's not a huge chance you'd be preggers|`|H2IhRXIIaa	I got pregnant a day after I stopped my period and it was by pre ***...and i was on birth control as well but i had been on it for about 4 years... im now 6 months pregnant. Good luck tho
3X0t8JrXaa	Yep.  Some women don't ever get a positive on HPT's.  I'd suggest blood test to get rid of any doubt.|`|35kVNi5oaa	get another one and take it the right way|`|9NC2CHQkaa	go get another test.
VHHis05Naa	Well.... you may not want to hear this, but there's every chance it could be better the second time around---or worse.  This is my second successful pregnancy and it's been a lot worse than my first.  I'm 29 weeks also and still sick.  It went to 22 weeks with my first.  The sickness is part of the reason I spaced my children the way I have.  They will be 3.5 years apart, as opposed to the average 2.  The second time around, you know what to expect and can try to prepare for it.  Our daughter is in preschool in the morning, so I can rest and have an easier time getting through the day.  If you have family support (I do not, I live across the country), you can get someone to agree to help out with your first child so you can carry a lighter load during your very worst times a few times a week.  My husband takes our daughter out every Saturday morning/early afternoon so I can rest and feel miserable at home while she's entertained.  You have to work together as a team to get through it much more than you did with your first.  If he's not onboard for helping, you will have a very tough time.  Also, make sure you notify your provider ASAP about your previous pregnancy sickness so they can be prepared to act quickly with meds if needed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  It's tough, but it will be worth it in the end.|`|gx4s68s8aa	I too had 9 months of morning sickness with my first pregnancy.  Not until the very end did my doctor even mention drugs to help prevent the throwing up.  And by then it was really too late.  And with my first I had a DVT in the 26 week.  I was hospitalized for a week with that, and it really made the rest of the pregnancy pretty difficult. I had heartburn so bad that I needed a prescription.  And then I had the usual problems as well that everyone seems to get.<br>  <br>  I did not want to be pregnant again.  But then one night we got a little careless and that was all it took.  So I found myself pregnant again and terrified of another clot and such.  And this pregnancy has been better.  The morning sickness has been a little better  (not tons better) but some better.  And my doctor suggested medicine for that much earlier this time.  And most of the time the medicine helps.  And because I am on blood thinners now (injections once a day, soon to be twice a day).  I haven't had any problem with clots in me or my baby.  So although this pregnancy has not been easy.  And it some ways it is a little harder since I have a toddler to take care of, it has been better.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I'm on my 1st pregnancy and mine has been really really easy YET just like you I don't want to get pregnant again.  To me I feel like "lightning won't strike twice" and the next time around will probably be horrible.  I would want more than one but I just feel like I don't want to keep rolling the dice...I totally lucked up on this pregnancy.  I'm "okay" with one really but my husband insists on 2 (he really wants four but then again his father is the worlds biggest whore and has 20 kids!).  Its caused a lot of fights.  I've had issues here and there but really don't think I'll have it this easy again.  So until he can bare a child we're having one :-)|`|PDHCOrOSaa	When I was pregnant with my now 14 month old I was so unbelievably sick I was hospitalized twice..once for dehydration because I couldn't even keep water down.<br>  When my morning sickness finally ended at 4 months everything was great until about my 8th month when I started to get horrible restless legs ( Like RLS...just them moving constant ) and I had HORRIBLE backache's and my feet were so swollen.<br>  <br>  Anyway the sickness was the biggest issue.  If I even seen a commercial on tv w/ food I'd throw up...about 13 or 14 times a day.  I swore I would never get pregnant again but now I'm thinking of ttc#2 but I'm scared.  I know this info doesn't help but I also want to say that most ppl I know have had two VERY different pregnancies so you may be fine w/ the second!|`|U1pYIbHOaa	They can be completely different!<br>  I had a teacher and she has two kids. The first kids pregnancy went great, no morning sickness or any horrible parts. Then with her second kid she had morning sickness and everything!<br>  Why she told us this I have noooo idea!<br>  But yes they can be different|`|0viZhxi6aa	I was sick until about 30 weeks with my first and had a miserable experience, but with  my second it was fine, I was sick from like weeks 6 - 10 and then was fine!|`|fwro8soqaa	Every pregnancy is a little different.  I know lots of women who have had a terrible pregnancy followed by an easy one, and vice versa.  And once you hold your child for the first time, you will completely forget all the vomiting and pain.  It's an experience that will make all the discomfort seem worth it.  And it is.  I also know women who just plain don't like pregnancy, but the joy of having a child makes them tolerate it the best they can.|`|DiuDO1Weaa	hi hun my first i never had any proble,s with at all i had a great pregnancy! and with this one i have had a few bumps on the way from 8 weeks to 16 and none since although pregnancy are not the same so my advice to you is if you decide to get pregnant again it could be the best one you had ,but it could be worse NOW don't take that the wrong way please but you can never predict it but i wish you the best of luck if you do decide to have another|`|xrEIAD2aaa	My first pregnancy I was sick the whole nine months.  It was horrible.  I threw up everything I ate and drank.  I basically slept on the bathroom floor.  I swore I would never have another child.  Well... six years later guess what.  I got pregnant again.  Now I could lie and tell you it was wonderful and much easier than the first but it wasn't.  It was worse. I threw up everything.  I got gestational diabetes so no more midnight chocolate eating.  I had insomnia.  I had a condition where I produced a lot of saliva, so I was constantly sick and throwing up from that. I was depressed and each month felt longer than the last. Not very positive huh? My point after all this is that it is eventually so worth it.  I have two beautiful girls. Would I do it again? Probably not for awhile, but there may be a day when I would be willing to try one more time for a little boy.Just one more time!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	My first was problem free and my second was horrible. Really really horrible.<br>  But 5 months later - i'm already re-thinking my vow to never do it again. It really is worth it in the end, and perhaps next time would be like my first.|`|NDpO8hX4aa	I'ma mother of 5 children and never had any of the same symtoms, or anything the same with any of my prenancies. everytime is different just like every child is different.|`|rHevYhzVaa	each and every one of my pregnancies were different.
HTN7g3B1aa	you're 26 weeks along, but you're in your 27th week. that's why you're getting things that say both. your weeks are counted from your lmp, which doesn't change. the number of weeks you are along will not change, but the baby may be growing slower or faster than "average" which is normal, so when they do an ultrasound it may show you at a week that doesn't seem right. if you get confused about how many weeks you are, just count from your lmp.|`|DiuDO1Weaa	your 26 weeks and 4 days i say this because i am due june 14th and i turn 26 weeks tommorow|`|rHevYhzVaa	whatever the little pinwheel at the dr office says|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	i think it is best to go with what you doctor tells you about your pregnancy and how many weeks you are|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	What has your doctor told you?|`|T48smu01aa	Go by what your doctor tells you......it might start to change back and forth.......But for the most part go with what the doc says and a pregnancy calculator.....which goes by your LMP......<br>  i was supose to be 27 weeks at my 3/D 4/D appt and they said I was 26 weeks and a couple days and then I went back to the doctor and the measured me at 26 weeks and then at 29 weeks I just saw a doctor yesterday and I measured right on schedule :) so it might start to change anyways good luck and congrats!!!
rBq189W1aa	From what I know about it, it's no more or less safe than any other means of communicating on the Internet.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, it's up to your daughter to keep herself safe, and for you to help her to do that. She needs to know to not give out personal information (full name, address, where she goes to school, things of that nature) to anybody she doesn't already know in 'the real world'. And to remember, anybody who she only knows over the Internet might not always be what/who they claim to be.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Sure. <br>  Isn't just like a status update kind of thing?<br>  <br>  And all you have to do is teach her how to be smart on the internet and the do's and don'ts.
2f6diQBiaa	Usually, a follicle is considered mature at around 18mm. Follicles tend to grow 1-2mm every day. You probably have another week or so until you ovulate. With Femara, you should ovulate sooner (about 5-10 days after your last pill). Given that you are on CD 20 and have not ovulated, they may need to increase your dose of Femara next cycle.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!
4AljTfVnaa	Well because when you have kids, most of your income goes to providing for them so they dont have as much to pay for school. Thats how the government thinks but I think its stupid. They see you as all your income only providing for you, therefore you all money for school.|`|xmVGViPiaa	Going to school is a lot harder when you have a child to take care of at home.  It is to support and encourage women who have children to go to school and complete their degrees.  I don't feel people should have children until they are ready but sometimes stuff happens, kwim?<br>  <br>  Not to mention also the addition of a child will lower your income bracket.  Children are expensive and easily cost more than tuition does each semester.  I don't agree with giving the money and assistance to people who don't need it but I am all for if a woman really needs the assistance to get it.<br>  Women need to be independent and not have to depend on a man to support the family.  What if something happens to him or they get a divorce?  She will always have a degree to fall back on to support her children.
y5sWmbtnaa	Slightly possible if perm traveled into her then yes. But highly unlikely.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Possibly, yes.  Sperm is microscopic, so you have no idea if one or two got up inside you.<br>  <br>  People who think it's not possible have obviously not paid attention in sex ed or health class.|`|P3e2kJtwaa	Are you SERIOUS?! Of course not!|`|cCdhHyF8aa	please stay a virgin until your married..teen pregnancy to very unattractive and our country is already in debt.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	It's possible, but unlikely.  However, she can get an STD that way very easily.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	No.  My advice stay a virgin until you are married and stay away from horny slugs.|`|e8259d706e4c0ff624821e09f8c00d53aa	No. Wasn't this question just asked? Plenty of answers on the other one.
JIGNnm5yaa	You can sometimes get a crampy pain after ovulation.  It's caused by the follicle being irritated after the release of the egg.  You could also be experiencing contractions of the fallopian tube.  All perfectly normal, and good secondary fertility signs that all is working as it should be.
d2MWWOwDaa	During pregnancy discharge increases. I'm 20 weeks now and there is a LOT of it.<br>  <br>  But it didn;t get to be loads too early on for me. You could just be ovulating but it's a bit early to tell either way right now.
puEjSoDfaa	I saw it last night. It's 2 and a half hours long. The action in it was cool, but I was confused a lot of the time. It's not as good as I heard it to be, but it was still a pretty good movie, just confusing in parts.|`|bWmOaK33aa	No me, yet
lv6gkEVaaa	Hi i have 4 kids the first 3 i started at 4 months but now its all changed now my mid wife said to start feeding my baby solids at 6 months ,my baby's only 5 weeks now so some time on the bottles.|`|SjX72fPyaa	I started my daughter at 4 months with 1 meal of food after a bottle. Now she's a little over 5 months and she gets 2 meals of baby food after bottles.|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	About 5.5 mos, a few spoons of fruit or veg purees (homemade) here & there, nothing regular.<br>  <br>  From 6 months increased it to regular meals 2 then up to 3<br>  <br>  No he's 7 mos he eats 3 meals a day of pretty much anything, he also has 2 teeth so can manage things like toast etc|`|BDsYZGTqaa	My little girl had solids at about 3 months. Wrong or not it seemed she needed it and she really enjoyed it! Shes seven months now with no digestive problems so it wasnt detrimental.. I just gave her a bit of baby rice and she absolutely loved it :-) You will know when the time is right :-) Good luck!|`|wjGj6uU3aa	You can start feeding a baby solids at 4 months but it is recommended 6 months. Depending on how you feel the baby will manage i say 4-5 months is ok.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	6 months as recommended.  started with just fruit and a little cereal at breakfast and added a little more each week.|`|fJ7OeopSaa	5 months ~ only one meal at a time followed by milk|`|sIj4jAoPaa	You usually start with rice and other step one or step 2 cereal between 4 and 6 months then move to vegetables, then meat, then fruit.  The only things you have to really avoid (besides what baby may be allergic to; ie dairy or nuts) is honey and egg for the first year.  By 8-10 months baby should be able to eat baby crackers, or other baby friendly solids such as shredded cheese and such and can start to drink juice from a cup.  As for how much - that is entirely up to you.  Maybe start off with just a little as it is more about learning than actually getting nutirition as baby will still be on formula until just after their first birthday (usually).|`|CDHcrkAZaa	The question is does your baby need food yet? I have a 6 months old baby girl and I have also been a nursery nurse looking after baby's for 3 years. If your baby is not satisfied after his/her milk maybe they do need to be weaned (depending on age).  Between 4 & 6 months baby's should only be given baby rice, fruit & veg. Only at 6 months should they be introduced to meat, gluten and wheat etc. As this is when their digestive systems are mature enough for this.<br>  <br>  I started to wean my daughter at around 4 1/2 months just with baby rice at first, then fruit & veg. She can now eat anything and it's great!|`|6ZjoX2Akaa	It depends of your baby. I started giving both of my kids a little cereal in their bottles in the evenings when they were 2 mos cuz they were both really big eaters. Really sloppy at first then gradually thicker. At about 4 or 5 mos I gave them cereal in the mornings too and mixed a little fruit in it.|`|4jbiS9hvaa	6.5 - 7 months for all 3 babies.  They had no interest in it earlier and also, they didn't need solids earlier.|`|hf0bEHRKaa	Our first baby started on solids around 8 months, we found bread good to start with.|`|KpTKRyqPaa	5-6 months when there teeth grow and if the choke keep feeding the babby milk|`|YS47Ci4paa	4 months we started rice and oatmeal. 5 months veggies and 6 months fruit.
AA10316164	The best person to ask: your doctor.  They would be able to give you a much better answer than anybody here could.|`|4AO2myzKaa	Is this your first pregnancy?  You may just not know how to tell what it is.  I thought my baby kept pushing his butt out and it felt all weird, but then I was telling a friend what it felt like and realized it was a contraction.  They are often painless.  Mine feel like something is pushing out of my tummy (think hard soccer ball) and it gets all firm for a few minutes.  I'm 25 weeks and since I've recognized what they are this past week I've felt it about 12 times.  They say you have them starting at 8 weeks, you just don't know what to feel for sometimes.|`|xmVGViPiaa	It may be normal for you.  Everyone is different.  The sickness and the diarrhea may be a sign that labor is coming up soon.  Your cervix can open up and start dilating very quickly, so just because you aren't dilated at all doesn't mean you aren't close to having your baby.  Good luck!!|`|vjK8ZT20aa	With my first daughter I experienced no braxton hicks, no false labor, the night I began having contractions at exactly 39wks my daughter was born 12 hours later.|`|BbWk7RNgaa	I never had any braxton hicks.  Nothing until the night I went into labor.  they didn't hit suddenly, or anything, but they were regular, every two hours, and built up from there.|`|Yr65nHRkaa	it is normal. they can start after twenty weeks, but they don't in every woman. thank your lucky stars!|`|JklLo5cQaa	Completely normal. I never had them either. Or if I did I really don't remember them. LOL. Just enjoy these last few weeks, I know it's hard when your uncomfortable but enjoy because you won't get them back. If you want you can try and walk. That seemed to help me. Good luck and congrats!|`|dLjbU6Qkaa	You are probably having them without feeling them.  With my first baby I didn't think I was having them but I was.  WIth my second, I felt them more and I felt them the most with my third.  It's different for each person and different for each pregnancy.  Don't worry, you'll be holding your baby soon!|`|c9WjySDIaa	Yes its very normal, I never had them either, I was a week past my due date and had to be induced, I was 1cm dilated at 40 weeks.

xmVGViPiaa	You need to use the urine from your first pee of the day.  It's possible that the second time you tested your urine was too diluted and the amount of hormone was too little to show up in the test.<br>  I would not drink tonight and then test tomorrow morning when you pee for the first time.|`|fvasfzxoaa	you cant get a false positive but you can get a false negative, your maybe testing to early and were lucky enough to get a good concentrate last night.

You can get a false positive, but I've never heard of a false negative." <-- There are both.

vue9NOhYaa	Taken as prescribed (I'm assuming the doctor knew you were pregnant) for a limited period of time, narcotics are considered to be safe to use during pregnancy. <br>  <br>  EDIT:  Catagory C drugs are prescribed, where needed, all the time.  There is no evidence of actual harm to the baby. (Phrases like 'could' and 'might' are very vague -- they don't mean baby will be harmed.)  <br>  It's really your decision. If you aren't in much pain, then take tylenol or stick it out.  If the pain is interfering with your life/sleep, then do what you need to do.|`|AA10186411	This is what I found:<br>  <br>  FDA pregnancy category C. Vicodin may be harmful to an unborn baby, and could cause breathing problems or addiction/withdrawal symptoms in a newborn.<br>  <br>  My sisters OB prescribed her some when she was pregnant, so I'm not really sure.  Maybe it depends on the dosage and length of time you take it.  I would call your OBs office immediately.|`|sGJhKesdaa	if they knew you are pregnant, which i'm sure you told them, then they should be safe to take, but if plain tylenol will do for now, i would take it instead.  i understand not wanting to take too many drugs during pregnancy.  you never know what might happen..  hopefully since it is just fractured and not broken it won't take too long to heal and maybe not hurt very long.  i have not broke anything so i would not know personally.  all i have done is sprain my ankles.|`|zF4acGKPaa	i would call your obgyn n let them know what was given to you and see if the dr says its ok. when i was prego with my 1st i had a pinched nerve and migraine headaches so my obgyn prescribed me loratabs!|`|xmVGViPiaa	You should call your OB and ask before taking them.|`|lYjLrqzOaa	Ask your OBGYN, NOW.

I don't know why women feel it is necessary to walk up to someone pregnant and share some horrendous story, I think it is just a brag fest - but I don't listen to it.

Merry Christmas x|`|SRzswqTeaa	(((hugs))<br>  <br>  If you have had sexual abuse, you may have a hard time letting go and letting your body do what it needs to do.  You need to remind yourself repeatedly that you are safe, and this is normal, and healthy - and is the best for your baby.  Your body is perfect and capable and you can do this!  Remember that you are safe.  You might want to share your abuse with your caregivers so they can be extra sensitive during your birth.  You might want to look fast and furious for a doula to help support you during your birth.   She will help hold your space and keep you comforted as well as give you physical support.  If you can't afford a doula,  just call around.  Google "doula" and the city you live in and start making calls - somebody will support you for free.  Email me if you need help locating one.  <br>  <br>  Take care and good luck with your birth

lgfFL7Tlaa	I've had two children at two different hospitals in two different cities and I was NEVER walked like a toddler to the bathroom.<br>  <br>  The Nurses are there to make sure things are going well with you, and they are trying to do it in your best interest. However if you feel uncomfortable with them doing something just let them know. They will try to respect that as much as possible as long as it doesn't interfere with your health.|`|FTFd3AQAaa	ok i did have a nurse show me the procedure involved in using the pads, because it's not just using a pad, they want to make sure you know it rinse yourself cus you really cant wipe yourself hard, also i was told to spray a medical disinfectant spray use hemorrhoid pads and another cream (don't recall what it was or was for) so a nurse did walk me through this but that was it,.. no one ever checked my blood flow, i was told to do that myself and no one ever checked for hemorrhoids.. though i admit i did have them kinda bad... i don't know if my treatment was normal or what but i wasn't really uncomfortable with any of it (other than of course the physical discomfort :)|`|1IDSGM71aa	Oh my gosh that would have pissed me off if they'd tried that with me lol. I wouldn't have let any of it happen. All they do at my hospital is check your urine the first two times you pee, to make sure you're peeing enough and all that. You just have to pee into this tub thing and they glance at it then dump it. What bugged me was the nursery nurses trying to get us to let them take our baby to the nursery when we kept telling them "No, if we want her in there we'll tell you." We chose to room-in and it seemed like every ten minutes they were coming and trying to talk us into giving her to them. And they gave her a pacifier when I told them not to. Overall the nurses at my hospital are great and really understanding about stuff, but there's always going to be something that they do that bugs you, no matter where you go.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I am usually a private person but that all went out the window when I had my daughter. Honestly, when you are in that position, you won't care. I joked with my fiance about this too. I've had probably 20 nurses and doctors touch and see EVERYTHING. During the first week home I called a lactation consultant to help me with nursing. So she was trying to help me breastfeed and teaching me how to hand express and she grabbed my nipple and squirted the milk out. By that point it didn't even phase me because your body basically becomes a public feature lol.|`|iXQYd0Cmaa	I am worried about that too it makes me feel really awkward!<br>  But my mom keeps on saying that once you have had the baby you don't care about things like that<br>  Good luck and lets hope for both of us that it wont be as bad or uncomfortable as we are thinking it might be|`|WbaSpiYpaa	That stuff doesn't bother me too much.  What does bother me is the way they whisk the baby off for a few hours to take blood, etc.  I just want to bond with the baby, and they do bring them back but it's at least a few hours.  That drives me crazy!|`|qImMwhUHaa	As long as they do it discreetly I don't care. They've seen it all before. I had a nurse try to change my linings while there was company in the room before. |`|xmVGViPiaa	Throwing up in front of the nurses and my DF bothers me.<br>  I really hope it doesn't happen to me.<br>  <br>  Also poo-ing during labor.  I know it should be the least of my worries but it does irk me to do that in front of the nurses.<br>  <br>  You just have to keep in mind they see it ALL DAY LONG and your case isn't going to be any different than anyone else's... It's just routine.|`|91x3trOnaa	Before I had my baby I was one of the most modest, easily embarassed people you could meet.  I would never dream of letting anyone see me in any state of undress.<br>  <br>  AFTER having the baby?  Well, something happened and I no longer got embarassed.  I even let a high school student interested in med school observe the birth!  It didn't bother me anymore.|`|SJkhbRmSaa	I hate the constant checks in the downstairs area too! Checking your pad, I hate when they even change the bed pad thing. My epidural didnt kick in till after my second was born, so she walked me to the shower as my leg was all gimp!LOL I felt so useless. But since this is my 3rd and last pregnancy, I'll never see them again, so Im going to let them help me all I can!
xmVGViPiaa	First, every woman is different.  I am 36 weeks pregnant and I haven't leaked any milk/colostrum at all.  Many women don't until after the baby is born, I wouldn't worry just be thankful you don't need to wear breast pads yet.<br>  <br>  Second, it is a good idea to breast feed your baby immediately after birth.  Tell your Dr and nurse that you wish to breast feed asap after the baby is born.  Even if it is just for 5 mins, right after the baby comes out he/she is very alert and it's a great time to introduce your baby to latching on.<br>  <br>  Also you can supplement with formula and many people do.  Depending on how well your baby picks up on breastfeeding, I would not introduce any artificial nipples/pacifiers to your baby for the first 4 weeks or until your baby knows how to latch on very well and breastfeeding is well established.  It can cause a baby to get confused if sometimes they are fed from your nipple and then other times from a bottle - at least until they get use to one or the other, then you can gradually switch between them...<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|yQWnMSc6aa	I did not leak my whole pregnancy. My colostrum I noticed when I was feeding my baby. My real milk did not come in until about 5 days after he was born.<br>  <br>  You can supplement with formula (I am) because I have flat nipples and breast feeding is very difficult for me. I do about half and half. Of course the more breast milk your baby can get the better. |`|pWDYcBA7aa	I am 24 weeks with my first ans I haven't started to leak yet either! I wonder the same thing!<br>  Everyone is different! But i heard that you can start to leak as early as 18- 20 weeks!<br>  Well good luck in your pregnancy!|`|isokr9cfaa	You can get it as early as twenty weeks some women get it even sooner. But some don't ever get pre-milk and then they get real milk about three days after delivering their baby. With my first my breasts started leaking around twenty weeks and I'm eighteen weeks with my second and my breasts are already leaking. When you do start breastfeeding you can supplement however much you want, it's best not to use formula too often though because the more you bottle feed the less milk you'll produce and it will be harder to breastfeed unless you're pumping often. 
uMIvRRjoaa	Wear clothes that allow for access- ie a tshirt, then lift, latch and go. If you're worried about flashing practice in front of a mirror. You may be shocked at just how little shows! I tried to do the "cover" thing early in the nursing relationship and showed a heck of a lot more than uncovered because my daughter screamed bloody murder as she whipped the cover off. If a bottle feeding mother doesn't have to hide neither should bfing moms- there's nothing wrong with feeding a baby!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.007b.com/breastfeeding_public.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.007b.com/breastfeeding_public...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/normal/bfip.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/normal/bfip.h...</a>|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	I very rarely use infant feeding rooms<br>  I have always just ensured I am wearing a simple vest under any top I have on, I then lift my top up, pull the vest down and feed my son discreetly. - This way no flesh is on display at all - you can only see material and his head - it also keeps my tummy covered and warm!|`|ROJans2Taa	I always used a blanket, but I have no problems with those that take the boob right out and feed, id rather see that then see them letting their baby scream because of hunger|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	just cover the babys head and yourself with a blanket, or bring some back up in a bottle|`|d2fcf78a4441e801854c7b22e08d60b8aa	If at a family or friends house or with family or friends in public I say do you mind if I breastfeed him. <br>  <br>  I am quite relaxed about breastfeeding in public. Most coffee shops are used to breastfeeding mothers. I have also found a quiet bench in a park, or a nice spot under a tree. If I am in a restaurant I ask for a secluded table so I can feed the baby, this both indicates my intentions to the service staff and ensures the quietest possible spot. Be a bit mindful of cultural differences, I wouldn't be comfortable breastfeeding in middle eastern or asian restaurants.<br>  <br>  I carry a wrap or pashmina with me, this can be used as a blanket, a wrap, and for discrete breastfeeding.|`|942758fd1ed500339f1a1e8db65b2d27aa	Well first off I would NEVER eat in a restroom so I wouldn't expect my baby to. I have a cover that goes over my shoulder & drapes down over the baby. It's very easy to cover yourself with a blanket if you aren't comfy nursing where everyone can see. If we are out & there's no bench in the store to sit on I will go out to the car to nurse him. (I cannot nurse standing up) If I"m at a friend/families house & am not comfy covering(or in my case my child keeps pulling the blanket off) then I nicely ask if they have a spare bedroom I could use to nurse him in. My big rule of thumb though is that I won't expect my child to eat where I wouldn't eat.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i just sit off to the side pf the crowd,  there is no reason to make a big show of it, but if my baby needs to eat then i will feed her wherever i am,  i dont feel the need to cover my baby or feed her in a dirty bathroom. once you have been doing it awhile you can usually adjust your shirt just enough to let the baby nurse without putting on a display.|`|hWe8vhKKaa	have a scarf with you always so you can cover your baby and one of your shouler (the one your nursing on)<br>  but i think its  discraceful that doing the most natural thing ever, but we have have to hide  it|`|08GDBedGaa	i wear a feeding bra and strechy vest with a cropped(60's type) cardigan, perfect outfit for discreetlt breastfeeding<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnxtiYmXig" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnxtiYmX...</a>|`|eDmdkUO3aa	I take a bottle of pumped milk with me.

Unfortunately many people appear to object to breast feeding in public, so why not sit in a corner, facing the corner and do what is natural. In your friends house, just excuse yourself and sit in the kitchen or even on the stairs for a spell to do what you have to do. There is no need to fully expose your whole breast to the public, though some men might appreciate it!, all thy wants is your nipple and that can easily be exposed.  Good luck.|`|28QPS6V9aa	When I breastfed I would just go out to my car if there was no where to breastfeed in private. I usually planned my trips ahead of time though and thought about the bathrooms, if I knew I wasn't going somewhere with a good place to breastfeed I pumped and just gave my daughter a bottle. When I was at families house I just went into a bedroom and fed her.|`|i4I0cuudaa	My daughter has been feeding her baby for past 6 months in restaurants, car parks, aeroplanes, etc.  She drapes a thin blanket or sheet over her shoulder and over baby and usually no-one even notices she is doing it.|`|AA12373801	I hate breastfeeding in public but when I have to I just throw a cover over us or use my coat<br>  <br>  when im visiting someone they usually let me use their room if im not comfortable doing it in front of everyone|`|f6391b0b92f0565b5a109f16dc70afdfaa	I lin forward and slowly take my booby out then cover with a muslin square.

Pull up the shirt and pull down the neck of the tank top. Latch baby on and use shirt to cover top of breast. I have walked through stores shopping while holding my baby like this and nursing. If you want to cover up I recommend a nursing apron. They have a little wire in the top so the material doesn't just lay flat and you can see your baby and what you are doing. They sell them at Target and probably a lot of other stores. You shouldn't have to feed in a restroom! If you have a baby sling they are also great for nursing and some of them have extra material to cover with.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	You can buy one of those nursing wraps that go around your neck and cover your baby while they nurse. You can just throw a light receiving blanket over you and baby if the baby will allow, or just wear a really loose top.

0Ei3ePJzaa	Actually my first son was at least 8 months before my periods came back, I was gleeful!  <br>  <br>  Having said that, it was about 2 months after I stopped breastfeeding.  You could get checked out by all means.  With my second child, I ran out of milk at Christmas, and my periods came back in late January.  My doctor said that it was hormonal, and that was why I had ran out of milk.  I was very sad and upset.<br>  <br>  However, in your situation, I don't think I would be unduly concerned - it may be quite normal due to your hormones, but as I say, do get checked out, just in case.|`|AA11066099	Hi, cant believe you havent been to the doctors yet!I would go straight away!!X|`|lD0VcAlpaa	It can take a while for your milk supply to completely diminish, leaving you still without a period. However, I'd take a home pregnancy test and see a doctor just in case there is a hormonal imbalance, it's rare but it can still happen.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	If you were still breastfeeding, I would say, "LUCKY GIRL!".<br>  <br>  But, since you're not, I'll say, "Congratulations on your next baby"...<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, there could be something else going on besides pregnancy, which is why you need to take a preg test now.  Then, if negative, go to your doctor.|`|Nnw9XM8Caa	i came on period 8th weeek after giving birth hes 9 weeks now was only on for 4 days, go to doctors.my milk has stopped as stopped at 7 weeks due to compercations|`|28QPS6V9aa	Is there any chance you're pregnant?

AA12046218	Well, she wouldn't be the first person to lie about pregnancy in order to keep a guy.. It happens far too often. I hope isn't so for your sake, but sounds like her pregnancy is troubled or not true. It would be great, if she could confirm the pregnancy for your eyes as well. (My husband wanted to see the pregnancy test after the positive result, just to get some reality into the situation and I had nothing against it.) Good luck.|`|l3JREgdyaa	I agree with AB. Bring home a pregnancy test and tell her to take it, if she refuses, leave. You really don't sound like you love her, and staying with her just because she's pregnant isn't a good idea.

GOOD LUCK to you and let me know how it goes<br>  <br>  and her saying im getting fat does sound like a hint to her lying!! when i was preggers with my daughter i started to show at 3 months but it veries from women. but if she dont showing anything soon i would leave and not look back!!!|`|9JdOD08gaa	She sounds kind of crazy to me.  It sounds like she's creating all of these "things" once you moved out.  This is one way to get you back.  If she's got nothing to hide then she should take another test while your there.  Yea it might piss her off if she's telling the truth about everything but it's better to know now.  If all else fails then make sure you go with her to her appointment on the 28th so you can see for yourself whats going on.  That is if she even has an appointment.  I'm sorry your going through this, get out while you can if she's lying!!|`|K9kN68fwaa	My advice to you is to run as far away from this girl as possible. She is nothing but trouble. Honestly if she was pregnant she would have proof. She sounds clingy and psychotic. You'll make a great parent someday with someone else. Run and run far if you don't want to live a life of hell! <br>  <br>  Lastly that is not lame that you were looking at baby rooms and have 4 names picked out. She knows that babies are your weakness and that the only way she can keep you is to throw the baby thing is your face. Can you honestly say that is what you want to deal with. Listen to a pregnant women, WE GET CRAZIER the further along the pregnancy line!!! So the way she is acting now will only get worse. |`|6GkxU7BSaa	i bet she some disease that she doesent want to tell u about so she is saying she is pregnant. or maybe her body is not used to being pregnant. idk|`|JB7IIKKvaa	The bleeding she had might have been her period, but periods usually last for around three days though. Make sure that the next time she goes to the "gynecologist" that you go with her to see if she is really pregnant or not! Sometimes once you first go to the gynecologist, that you have to wait for about a week or so. In your question, she sounds kind off, well, delusional. I hope that you find out if you are going to be a father or... not. Also, if she wouldn't take the test for you, then I doubt she is really pregnant.|`|Vb5zubpJaa	If she has already taken 2 tests and they said she was negative, and she has bled a lot repeatedly then she most likely is NOT currently pregnant. You dont have to wait for a drs appointment. Miscarriage or risk of miscarriage is considered an emergency. Take her to the ER, and they will do a pregnancy test right there. That way, you will know for sure if she is pregnant or not. By the way, you don't just automatically start lithium treatment for bipolar disorder and become cured. Bipolar disorder is a chronic illness, and it can take years to become stable. She doesn't sound stable at all, and if she's taking Lithium, she needs an emergency appointment anyways, because most psych meds will really mess up a baby. She sounds like a drama queen, or someone who is really unstable, and I really doubt her pregnancy claims. It could be that she's manic and she actually thinks she is pregnant, or she might just be enjoying the attention. Get it over with now, take her to the ER!|`|o4Y4XtfXaa	to me, i think she's lying!<br>  because normally your supposed to know 5 days after you missed period and if its been two weeks since yall did whatever you did..<br>  and it STiLL says negativee, then trust me.. she's lyingg!! |`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I think she's trying to tell you she wants you to do the honorable thing and marry her.|`|MATiTs5Oaa	Tell her you want to go and see the doctor together and go to both her gynecologist and her psychatric doctor together.<br>  Blackmail her, tell her unless she lets you see the doctors and talk over and learn about the situation, you are not going to believe her.<br>  Take the appointments and talk over your concerns with the docs.<br>  If she does not permit you, she may be lying just to keep you by her side.|`|fjeFBGlqaa	i think she is lying because she didnt want you to go. so i would make her test and if she doesnt i would leave.|`|DneneGsxaa	i would hope that she is not lying but some women will say pretty much anything to make their men stay with them, i honestly would ask her to pee on a stick, or to have her show her results of this positive pregnancy test, the doc has records of it, if she is not lying, then she won't have any prbblem doing this..... she needs to go to the doc. if she IS pregnant and bleeding, just in case, you never know , it could be from anything, and you don't know if it is serious or not unless you go. .. so you should take her then that will put your mind at ease as well. good luck, and i am sorry if she is lying. but you are doing the good and responsible thing by staying until you get the results... good luck. |`|k22sOk2Raa	She has big issues, and taking lithium while pregnant is something i would be concerned about. get a pregnancy test and have her do it in front of you period. even if she did miscarry the test would be positive.<br>  Once its proven that she is not pregnant (sorry just think she's not) and be careful, she may be trying to get pregnant now if you are having unprotected sex, and will end up preggers.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	I would make her take another pregnancy test, so you can see it with her own eyes.  Something doesn't sound right.  A doctor wouldn't let her take lithium while she is pregnant.  I have an anxiety disorder, and I was not aloud to take anything for it.  And you read it yourself, it could be harmful in the first trimester, what doctor in his right mind would let her contiue the meds?  That is just screaming lawsuit.  Good luck!

For your baby ALL you'll need is an outfit to go home in and maybe one blanket. That's it. Everything else will be provided by the hospital.<br>  <br>  While I was staying I just wore a nightgown the whole time and then changed into my going home outfit the day we left. I brought my toiletries and some slippers and that was pretty much it.<br>  <br>  You'll want to take nursing pads and cream if you're planning on breastfeeding, but your other "extras" you are worrying about you won't need!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	you wont need too many burp clothes probably<br>  <br>   you won't need rash cream in the hospital- they don't come out with diaper rash- my son did not gegt his first until 6 months old and it was a yeast rash from staying moist becausee he was sweating a lot- if you're breastfeeding then you won't need bottles- did not use make-up and didn't even care what i looked like|`|NpSVEC2naa	definitly take nursing pads and make up, also take a pillow for yourself as the hospital ones are rock hard. i used a nail file on my baby cuz nail clippers can make the nails very sharp. <br>  <br>  sounds like your pretty on to it tho.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|EYSl68csaa	You do not need a bunch of undies and pads because the hospital supplies you with these net things with big pads they are awkward but they keep you from having to throw away messed up undies,<br>  <br>  I personally do use makeup I take a shower as soon as they take out the iv and put makeup on because it makes me feel good not to look like I just popped out a baby.<br>  <br>  You could use a shampoo plus conditioner just to save room, chap stick is a must. Hard candies are generally just cause they don't allow you to eat in labor.<br>  <br>  You will not need: bottles, razors, rash cream, clippers, nursing pads (you wont get milk in for a few days after birth) nursing pillow will just take up space. you wont need breast cream yet, the docs don't like you using lotions etc on a brand new baby because of allergies. the doc will supply you with a pacifier and diapers and wipes (take a few but not mass supplies) you only need 1 outfit try a 0-3mo it fits the teeny things a lil baggy but still cute, the hospital supplies shirts and hats and blankets and the hospital will supply you or the dad with extra pillows so no need to pack more.<br>  <br>  You should only be there for 24-48 hours so don't over pack you will find it hard to take everything out of the room because visitors give you flowers etc you take home to.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ZncV5gc0aa	You will want baby clipper & file so baby won't scratch face.<br>  you will want nursing pads (bring 8 or so in a ziplock) & bra. <br>  You'll probably wear pajamas home. Just bring 2 pair<br>  Granny panties, the high briefs! You will not want them rubbing in case of c-section also they add a bit of support on them big ol' pads! <br>  You wont use any makeup, but the chapstick and your own soaps, etc...  because the hospital's suck!<br>  <br>  In a diaper bag, <br>  picture outfit<br>  nail clipper<br>  going home outfit<br>  mittens<br>  socks<br>  hat<br>  baby book<br>  <br>  (hospital gives you most of what you need)|`|0lYBW1Toaa	You may be a little excited - that's good, but realise the hospital supplies most of what you will need.  Just pack for you, as if you're going for one night - whatever makes you comfortable staying out one night.  They even give you the pads.  Let your bf/fiance/husband bring the camera for the birth, etc. An outfit for you, maybe one for baby.  Hubby can bring whatever he wants (mine just crashed in the chair next to me!) for his comfort.<br>  |`|jNtkhOTVaa	Your list for moms looks pretty accurate,  If you have longish hair get hair scrunchies!  I was on the delivery table when my best friend called and he asked if he could get me anything.  All I wanted was scrunchies!  My mother in law was smart enough to think of the chap stick.  I had no idea!  It was a good idea!<br>  You might get a tennis ball too.  It's great for your s/o to rub on your back if you have back labor.  I didn't luckily.  But lots of people swear by it.<br>  I don't know how they do it in your hospital.  It's a good idea to ask your doctor but they supplied basically everything for our baby.  They supplied the diapers, wipes,  little hospital onesie, little baby hats, mittens if needed, bottles... the works.  The only thing we brought for him was a blanket and his going home outfit which doubled for photos.  They sent us home with diapers, a little baby hair brush and a thermometer.<br>  A breast pillow is a GREAT idea if you're breast feeding.  I could not get comfortable using hospital pillows.  Doubtful that you'll need nursing pads or breast cream yet.  But if you do need the cream tell the doctors so they will set you up with the good stuff.  <br>  Probably won't need razors, baby clippers, and like I said, may not need bottles and stuff like that depending on your hospital.<br>  Hope that helped.|`|moSc6jRTaa	u dnt really need to bring baby bottles with u if u decide to nurse they supply them if u dnt nurse u might want to bring diaper rash cream just in case u don't have to bring breast cream the hospital will give u some u might want to bring a nursing pillow its a great thing to have     good luck with ur soon to be baby ps:it best to bring both onsies and sleepers  hope this helps u :)|`|txVkhi8baa	You should not need diaper rash cream or bottles they have all that and told me they prefer you use theirs. I didn't worry about any makeup or razors while I was at the hospital but that is just individual preference. Be aware if you put the clothes you brought on the baby and they take him/her to the nursery they will take the clothes off and put the hospital shirt back on.  Congrats and good luck.
1JbdCRdtaa	Sounds like a plugged duct. You need to massage is when feeding and probably call the doctor in case you get mastitis.  Mastitis comes on very quickly and it feels like you have the flue with the chills and fever. Call your doctor and keep massaging!<br>  <br>  Hayley<br>  <br>  DON'T STOP BREASTFEEDING ON THAT SIDE!|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Search friction blisters on kellymom....I'd do it for you but NWT|`|858a0632fe3d77a7fe9bf558aaa8a346aa	Seriously, it's probably a pimple.  Those little bumps around your nipple are oil glands and thay can get clogged.  Try warm compresses, and maybe even try popping it if it doesn't hurt too much.
uUlKhoLcaa	Good for you for stepping up to be a mentor to your younger sibling. <br>  <br>  Here's the trick you maybe haven't thought of: Sitting down with your sister and talking with her about your values and what behavior you think is appropriate should be a SEPERATE EVENT from disciplining her when she does something unacceptable. <br>  <br>  The best way for her not to hide her behavior is for you to keep plugging away at keeping a close relationship with her when it's not the middle of a confrontational situation. Talking to her on a daily basis, planning activities together frequently (this is different then seeing each other around the house all the time), and supporting her positive interests will keep a natural flow of communication open. <br>  <br>  When she moves in with you, set the boundaries (curfew, no drinking, no drugs, no boyfriends staying overnight, etc.) so she doesn't set a precedent of taking advantage of your non-parent status. If you catch her smoking pot or other unacceptable behavior, you need to be clear and consistent in the way you address it. Now's not the time to worry about her reaction or how she'll sneak around more if you punish her, etc. Remember that this is your home and this is not a negotiation. You're in charge. Don't get in to a debate, try telling her you would be happy to have a discussion with her about it the next day when you've both had time to gather your thoughts. <br>  <br>  For how exactly to discipline, with teens it's all about the things that you can take away. Does she have a computer in her room? As a punishment, move it in to a public space in your home so she can only use it for schoolwork. Does she have a nice cell phone with email and and a camera etc? Deactivate it. Dig up an ancient model out of your junk drawer with no features and reactivate it so she'll have it for safety purposes only. Allowance, class trips, even hair and nail appointments that you pay for are all priveleges that she needs to understand she is not entitled to. Priveleges are contingent on her maintaining responsible behavior. If your Mom paid for any of her things, I'm sure she would agree with this tactic too. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vw4KXRlLaa	It would help a lot to know how you discipline her as of now, in order to use that to determine what might work more effectively.|`|Ruifi0GSaa	Hi, yeah I had that same problem, only she started to misbehave around 14. And I could see that she was starting to sneak around to boys places, I end up putting her on birth control when she was around 15. She forgot to take the pill and got pregnant anyhow, at first I thought she had the flu or food poison. Then a light came on and I got her checked, came back positive. Arrggg!!<br>  She is now 18 almost 19, married the guy that got her pregnant and I have a sweet grandson. She finished High School, and is now working full time and going to college. :)<br>  Not saying that your child will get pregnant, but have a heart to heart talk with her, without putting her down.<br>  She might need to talk to a councilor too, this helped my daughter out a lot. <br>  Hope that helps, good luck! it will get better, just need to keep a positive out look on this. My daughter and I are so very close now.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	If she's smoking pot, take her to get treatment or something.<br>  <br>  If she likes to argue, send her to law school where she can do it all she wants.<br>  <br>  I'm a teenager, and most discipline really doesn't change some behavior. Teens will hide things from their parents to avoid punishment if they've gotten punished before.<br>  <br>  Sit her down and talk to her.
CebrECkiaa	no they are not. The base is a little bit bigger on the safeseat. I had the same issue.
aLAmvX5Naa	Some babies need it. Some won't take milk. Some still need the nutrients to grow properly. It is like pediasure, but in powder form!<br>  <br>  I think 12 months is like, a minimum age, and after that you have the choice of continuing to pay $28 per can or you can switch to a much much cheaper gallon of milk.<br>  <br>  Plus, the next stage of infant formula is a new thing. Companies like to make money.|`|5ujzs0k3aa	Yes it is different from baby formula. It has different nutrients in it especially for toddlers. They make it for babies with food allergies, poor weight gain, or who do not take well to solid foods.|`|YVasdve0aa	The makers say that it makes sure your baby gets all the vitamins they need until their appetite picks up.  my pediatrician says that as long as you feed your baby a wide variety of foods then their is really no evidence that it really helps.  To be honest I used it for a while because I felt like my son didn't really eat enough and I was scared it would affect him.  I kind of fell for it I guess.  I can say that as far as convience it was great.  I would scoup out a little, put it in a sippy cup  and take it with us on day trips.  It doesn't spoil as fast as regular milk so it came in handy.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, yes it is different.  It has more vitamins and less fats.  It definitely shouldn't be used in place of formula for infants under 12 months.
Yz2TvEMlaa	some people do it because they dont wish to give either the father's last name or the mother's last name. It's tradition to give the father's last name, but some women find that sexist.. and instead of giving them their own last names they decide to come up with a name separate from the names of the parents. Some people make a last name up out of the two last names, like a mixture.. I find it kind of ridiculous myself.. but to each their own.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	I've heard of some people doing it, but I'm not sure why.|`|PNuPl0d4aa	well if their last name was "whitehead" or "blackhead" or "butt" or "pigg" (these are not made up, i've heard them all)...then i could see why you would change the last name. But i would change mine, too. not just my baby's.<br>  <br>  What if your last name was blackhead??!! It'd be awful!
yNXIxcsYaa	Yes, you are fine as long as you aren't planning on going to one all the time.  Go!  Have fun!|`|fUU9OnSqaa	Any loud noise alerts the baby, not hurt. When I was pregnant with my first son, I was 28 wks and went to a football game. And boy was I into the game.<br>  <br>  Stay active while your pregnant. I also went clubbin, just to get on the dance floor and still do with my second pregnancy, which I'm 38 wks right now. Music is great!<br>  <br>  Good luck and Congratz |`|FWdMuM2vaa	Well, I'd say that the noise wouldn't be harmful, maybe just a little startling. Depending on the type of concert, you may not want to be around the wild crowd. I turned down several concerts, including Warped Tour for that very reason.|`|AA11108482	If your ok with the noise level the baby will be even better. For them the noise is muffled.|`|VWtbSFluaa	Make sure it's music the baby will enjoy..haha!<br>  <br>  Seriously, i went to a series of rodeo concerts a month before my son was born & he was born screaming!|`|7NzB2obCaa	yh because inside your belly it sounds like a washing machine already so baby won't hear much of the loud music|`|qkCyax6iaa	it depends if thers gonna b alot of people they could bump into u,, also depends how many months are u pregnant|`|xmVGViPiaa	You should be fine.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	party on jsut dont let ppl bump ya your baby might dance around|`|aec0a315ba82df417988623b48e5f8b7aa	it should be fine, they only hear the noise later in pregnancy anyways, but i am not sure how far along you are, but most doctors agree it should not hurt the baby any.|`|dGBrlJvgaa	Yes it is safe. You might even find that the baby enjoys the music. I went to a concert at 12 weeks and another at 7 months. At the one I went to at 7 months, my son was moving around so much, he loved it :)|`|Fm3L8vsYaa	yes noise is fine just dont be down in the mosh pit or anything :) <br>  ive been to 2 concerts while ive been pregnant both were kind of early on though at this point i dont think i could sit comfortabley through a concert |`|Wkf0YTKtaa	I did.  I was about 20 weeks and went to see Nonpoint and Sevendust.  |`|l6nAcep5aa	well they dont hear much till bout 4 months, and im sure they'd like the music :P

MiiYQc0Oaa	No, that seems be spot on. And the trend... my 13 month old sleeps 9pm - 9am and has a two hour after-noon nap also.|`|jNtkhOTVaa	For what its worth I was watching the new show The Doctors the other day and thats exactly what they were saying.  Kid's aren't getting enough sleep and even when they are a bit older than that they require around 12 hours of sleep.  It helps them to function better and to learn better.|`|YPuVx2Niaa	Not at all.  My baby (15 mo) sleeps from 7 pm to 7 am and takes 1-2 hour nap in the day.  I'm thankful every day for it LOL.

When i started dating my Fiance, His mother despised me. She was always trying to talk him into leaving me. So, when i became pregnant 19 Weeks ago, she assumed that i did it on purpose to ruin her sons life and she told everyone that there were so many other possible fathers and she called me every name in the book. And not only her, but his whole entire family. He has always been a Mamas boy so he would confront her about it, but he would never really be that firm. So, she wouldn't take him seriously and she would continue doing what she was doing. Just recently, he proposed to me. & When she went to say something about it, he finally really stood up for me and said that i was his fiance and i was carrying his child and that they were gonna respect me.<br>  <br>  <br>  Trust me, he will too. Just give it a little time. & Have patience, don't argue back with her because it only makes things worse. Trust me, i know because i called his mother and father every name in the book and it didn't get any better for me. Lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  & Don't be discouraged. Just because you got in school on a scholarship doesn't mean that you couldn't afford it, it means that either you were so smart or so talented in something that you got a free ride in. You should be proud, because where as alot of other people got denied to go to that school you got accepted! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  I wish for you and your baby the best :)<br>  Good Luck :)|`|tDEiKXIQaa	You have a little Blessing on the way, you will do great God Bless|`|LRvjfQyhaa	"I want to tell her that I didn't get my own self pregnant."<br>  <br>  ^^ I'd say exactly that.  Just don't say it with an attitude or anything - you don't want this woman hating you forever.  Next time she runs her mouth just say something like "It took too of us to get into this situation.  Remember, your son is part of this too."  <br>  <br>  Because it seems to me that she's completely missing the fact that her son is about to become a father.   Or maybe she's still so shocked that this is her way of dealing with it.  However - it doesn't give her the right to treat you like dirt.|`|dy34Qyugaa	It takes two to tango.  The mother is obviously in denial about how babies are made.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it.  It is just her own insecurities showing.  I suppose you could snap and say, "if you want to ever see your grandchild, I suggest you start acting like a grandmother."<br>  <br>  Tell her, "I am an adult.  I do not need your useless advice, and I'd appreciate it if you would leave your snide comments to yourself."<br>  <br>  If she doesn't stop - -- then stop talking to her completely.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	I'm very sorry that you're in this situation, having to feel those feelings.  Money will never make you who you are. Some people will never understand that. Instead of judging your character qualities they want to know where you bought your shoes. It's sad, but we can't change them. Love yourself. Even an unplanned pregnancy can be the best gift you'll ever recieve. Even if it doesn't seem like it at the time. I was 19 when I got pregnant with my son. I had already been with his father for some time, but it was not in any way planned. He was in collage and I was planning on going to collage. I was schedualed to have my placement test the week after I found out. I was also working full time. I had been living on my own for quite a few years because my mother no longer wanted to be a mother. I put everything on hold and didn't enter collage as I had planned. He is 5 years old now. I can't tell you how wonderful it is. I wasn't rich at all. My husband graduated from collage when my son was almost 2 years old and I have a 3 year old daughter.  We bought a nice house and we're happy. Not rich though. Suppose your boyfriends mother woudln't care for me either. You're so much better than her just for the fact that you can go through that and control youself. That's something! Stick together. Try to distance yourself from her hurtful ways. You're not a whore or a slut. You're a woman who got pregnant WITH the help of a man. You didn't do it on you own honey. Wish I had better advise but I hope this helps anyway. Believe in yourself. Good luck to you and your boyfriend. <br>  |`|0DySiCfRaa	don't worry. this mother is obviously a rich snob who probably doesn't know how to really love anyone considering everything in life was handed to her. My guess is she had a nanny raise her son.. don't worry about it, you are a good person and don't need some rich spoiled b**** with a lap dog telling you any different :)|`|7fZFl6Avaa	If it really really bothers you i would say somethin to her. She sounds like a ******. If your guy talked to her and she didnt do anything i would say somethin. Dont be afraid of her bc shes rich bc the father wants to be the father and he has money too lol. You should never let someone make you feel so low. |`|ppafedlgaa	Don't let it get to you. If he's okay with you and you guys are doing well, don't be concerned with her. She's probably just as shocked as you are. Good thing is, though, that she can say anything she wants, but you know what kind of person you are inside, and if your baby's dad chooses to stand by you, be ahppy about it. I promise his mom will be different once the baby gets here. She knows that she won't get to see the baby unless you let her. It's sweet justice for mean in-laws. lol|`|xmVGViPiaa	I'm in a similar situation but mine is not about money.  My MIL has acted very rude to me since I became pregnant and is always insulting me when I am not around.  My boyfriend sticks up for me.  Just have the father keep sticking up for you.  Eventually his mom will see you aren't just going to disappear and that this baby is just as much her son's as it is yours.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't stop then there's really nothing to lose.  If the baby's father is involved in your child's life and you are as well, you all don't need that witch in your lives.  It will be more her loss than yours anyways, you can't lose something you never had.  I wouldn't worry about it - enjoy your pregnancy and enjoy your baby.  You don't need her support to do that.  All your baby really needs is YOU, your child will be happy without her (and in this case it's probably BETTER if she's not a part of your child's life because imagine all of the witchy things she will be telling your own child about YOU when you aren't around!).
ytNlz3b7aa	Pregnancy is all or nothing. So it's either 100% or zero.|`|uE86mMsxaa	Ok, I've had that before, and, yes, it does mean ur ovulating. But, u have to have unprotected sex 48 hrs after u start ovulating to get pregnant. But u should still take a pregnancy test!|`|yA7j9QpSaa	Um ya there is like a 50% chance<br>  that a very disgusting story<br>  sorry but its true<br>  |`|9GW3hfKZaa	50/50|`|AA11829548	First - stop using unprotected sex!!! You gotta know this after 25 years of AIDS education being available!<br>  <br>  Second - you "might" be pregnant if you had sex on the day before or the day of ovulation. The clear "snotty" discharge can be the host environment that the egg was in, and depending on the timing of his "pull-out" you may have hit it just at the wrong time. <br>  <br>  Call your gynecologist, and ask for a 24-hour pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  But then what? If you ARE, what do you consider your choices to be? If you AREN'T, what will you do about preventing the same scare another time?<br>  <br>  You gotta think, girl. Ask the BF if he is ready to be a daddy who has to pay child support for the next 18 years?! If not, I strongly suggest condoms. If he isn't coming inside you anyway, he shouldn't mind wearing it while you are fooling around. If he doesn't want to wear them at least until you get on some other birth control, then he doesn't have your best interests in mind and is only a "f-ck buddy" and not a real boyfriend.<br>  <br>  You MUST take care of YOUR own best interests. Real men understand this.|`|YshFzwoaaa	well maybe its because of you're period, im not sure ,but if i think what it is i get the same before i get my period. but like barely. but still go get a pregnancy test. |`|7VpoyfaIaa	yea its just ur ovulation i get it 2 an it annoys the heck outta me<br>  i didnt always get it either<br>  if ur tht worried wait and see if you get ur period|`|MQP8hqyHaa	50/50. ... no, seriously, thats ur chance no matter what (unless u didnt have sex, than u definately will not get pregnant, lol)|`|7CYHN5cnaa	ooh this is bad,  I did the calculations and it's definately 71.76%|`|Cm4bvA3faa	id say bout 80 %|`|xt7H6dn8aa	GO SEE UR DOCTOR|`|0nLdwZP2aa	Yes, it is possible.  Nobody can give you a percentage, though.<br>  <br>  It's unlikely that precum could cause pregnancy but that DOES NOT mean it is impossible;  even if it hasn't got you pregnant before, that really has no bearing on whether it will now.  It ALWAYS CAN impregnate you, so you should treat it as 'dangerous' as semen.<br>  <br>  The clear snotty discharge is not anything to worry about; for a sexually active girl, it's not uncommon.  It could just be your sexual fluids.  Precum is clear but there's usually not enough that you'd notice it, and semen is rather cloudy, so it doesn't sound like either of those.  <br>  <br>  Wait until the 30th, or a few days after.  (Even if you are normally regular periods can come late.)  If your period does not arrive, take a pregnancy test.  If it's negative, take another one a week afterward, and if it's still negative, nothing to worry about.  If either test is positive, you need to make an appointment with the doctor immediately for a blood test and other prenatal care.<br>  <br>  Until then, stop having unprotected sex.  Pulling out is a notoriously unreliable method of birth control.  Either get on the pill or make him wear a condom;  this scare should be enough to tell you that you don't want to go through this again.  |`|xmVGViPiaa	We can't give you the percentage, but any time you have unprotected sex you can become pregnant.  Just because it hasn't happened in the last 3 months doesn't mean it won't - many couples who are TRYING to have a baby can't conceive within that time period... It's just best not to take chances like that.<br>  <br>  Anyway the snotty discharge is what we call EWCM or egg white cervical mucous because it looks like egg whites.  It is due to ovulation.  I always notice that some months I would get a lot of it and other months hardly any of it, so it doesn't matter if you've never gotten it before: that's most likely what it is.<br>  <br>  If it starts to smell bad or is accompanied by blood, or a weird color like green or yellow, you need to call your Dr but otherwise it is fine.|`|MPTTbYwgaa	1 in something|`|J546AhTTaa	I dont think ur pregnant ! Thats only a regular thing !|`|PN7ELn3aaa	I'm gonna ask you something that may sound gross, but are you SURE he didn't do the deed in you? Clear, snotty looking "discharge" noticed on the same day you had unprotected sex with someone sounds very much like something else.<br>  <br>  If you have unprotected sex, it is very possible you are pregnant...just from that information alone. <br>  <br>  Discharge is normal, sometimes it is heavier before a period, but if it is something out of the blue it could mean something is different with your body right now. The only way to know for sure is to test a day or so before your period. <br>  <br>  I hope it goes your way!

There have been studies that, when a man's counter part becomes pregnant, (ever hear of the term sympathy belly??) he too can also feel the same effects that the mother does (increased weight gain, nausea, etc)! Look it up! I'm sure this was a joke question, but believe it or not, not stupid!<br>  <br>  What Causes Sympathy Pains?<br>  Psychosomatic Responses <br>  <br>  Psychology-based theories suggest that symptoms of couvade may be physical manifestations of a man’s subconscious attempts to adjust to the pregnancy. During his partner’s pregnancy, a man may manifest symptoms in order to (subconsciously) identify with his partner, bond with the fetus, assert his paternity, or reclaim his wife’s attention.<br>  <br>  Hormonal Fluctuations <br>  <br>  As mentioned, a man’s fluctuating hormone levels during his partner’s pregnancy may contribute to sympathy pains.<br>  <br>  Stress - A simpler explanation may be that, like any major life change, preparing for fatherhood is stressful. Sympathy pains may merely be an outlet for that stress.<br>  <br>  Circadian rhythms – The changes in a couple’s daily life during pregnancy may disturb a man’s circadian rhythms – his daily biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes – enough to cause sympathy pains.|`|mTyu7CKoaa	oh yes.... every man these days get pregnant... thanks for the 2 points|`|AA10390690	uhm sure why not... hahaha|`|s1utniuvaa	Sure pee on a test lol my ex did and it came up positive lol|`|QYYWBrG7aa	lmao.that`s for the two points...MEN can NOT get pregnant maybe u need more sex ED in school|`|SMkB2LKIaa	Maybe you are a hermaphrodite and just don't know it.

When i went back in 4 weeks ( at 8 weeks them) they asked me questions, weighted me took my blood pressure and done a ultrasound. Yes i got to keep my ultrasound pic. Ask your doctor if you could get a copy of it. They should be able to do that for you. You may even have to get blood drawn just to check and see where your hcg levels are at. That is what I have to do.<br>  <br>  Just as you know around your next appointment after your first one they will do weight, blood pressure and everything but they probably wont do a ultrasound. They may listen to the babies heart beat that is what they did at my appointment last week. And don't get alarmed if they can't find it after a few min just give me and min and they will find it that is what happened to me. You may be lucky enough that they might listen to the heart beat when you go in for the 10 weeks, it just depends on your doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck |`|AA10929461	At your fist appointment they will have you give a urine sample, take your blood pressure, and weigh you. (Actually, these things will occur every time you go from this point on). They will test the urine to confirm you are, in fact, pregnant. The doctor will congratulate you, ask you for the first date of your last period and give you an estimated due date. They will have you fill out forms, and give you some free samples, and the book "What to Expect When Expecting" and set you up with your next appointment.

My ultrasound was scheduled for a week later, where I saw the heartbeat [didn't hear it, won't be able to until my next appt. 12/03] and yes, I got to keep pictures from the ultrasound.

Fa130w6Gaa	Congratulations! I just got my bfp this morning too! So, to answer your questions, you should call on monday to schedule your first prenatal visit, most doctors don't see you until you are about 8 weeks. They don't always do a blood test but you can ask your doctor to do one. You would be about 4 weeks along right now. They count from the first day of your last period. Sounds like you are doing things right with the vitamin and eating folic acid. Check out babycenter.com for more tips and also the book "What to Expect When You're Expecting". Both are EXCELLENT resources and I've used both with my first 2 pregnancies and will again with this one. When you start to show varies from person to person and includes lots of different factors so there really is no way to know when you will start to show but probably not for a few months. I was about 5 months with my first when I started showing, happens faster in 2nd+ pregnancies. Hope you have a wonderful, healthy pregnancy!|`|BWUlksmmaa	Congratulations!  My doc wouldn't even see me until I was 8 weeks along - you won't need a blood test to prove it with the amount of tests you have done.  Prenatal vitamins are essential so is avoiding certain food (raw egg, undercooked meat etc).  Just relax and enjoy reading up on everything on various websites.  You can do a seach of how far along you are - its take from the start of your LMP so yes, about 4 weeks.|`|clZNh1VWaa	1. im 12 weeks and havent took blood tests they did urine, i went to the health dept to get a proof of pregnancy.<br>  2. i would say thats a fact<br>  3. i have no idea and get confused on that myself google a pregnanct calander enter your last MP and it can tell you.<br>  4. i guess? lol<br>  5. i didnt know till i was 9 weeks along i miss periods all the time and have never been pregnant. vomiting for 2 weeks, so that started at 7weeks, stopped vomiting 10 weeks. wasnt really hungry for the past month-ish, at 11 weeks  i wanted to eat everything in site lol. and thats when i woke up one morning and my bf said YOUR SHOWING!!! lol hes so excited.. lol<br>  Hope this helped a little bit! Goodluck|`|cc3bc74da528c9ab08e77b61000dc40faa	First of all calm down, home pregnancy tests are very accurate so you probably are pregnant,  call your Doctor,  it will all work out. from my calculations ur due date will be November 15th.  the way you come up with that is u take the first day of ur last period count back 3 months and add 7 days.|`|lpllr9MDaa	When I got my positive, I went to see my GP because I didn't know what else to do.  She said there is no reason for a blood test because today's preg tests are very accurate, so yes, you are pregnant.  You need to make an appt to see an OB/GYN - they usually don't want to see you until 8-10 weeks.  There are lots of due date calculators online, I found www.babycenter.com to be very helpful.  You can sign up to get weekly emails showing the progress of your growing little one.  I didn't start showing till around 4-5 months, but everyone is different.  Congratulations!
FLLPvhUdaa	yay  I doubt it will turn again.  And trust me you will know when you are in labor - i was induce with my first and was really scared about going into labor with my second as i didn't know what the signs were.  But trust me you will know. and it is much easier going into labour naturally.|`|WGXdfh22aa	congratulations. i think there is still a small chance that he could turn back around but i doubt it. since he is engaged he will probably stay in that position. good luck!!!|`|uQ4UL12Waa	CONGRATS !! YOU GET TO MEET YOUR BABY SOON . I THINK ONCE THEY ARE ENGAGED  THEY STAY PUT . HOPEFULLY IN YOUR CASE  HE WILL <br>  <br>  <br>    GOOD LUCK GIRL!!<br>    HAVE A SAFE DELIVERY :)|`|0LwBdwAPaa	good luck|`|SpRfwm7qaa	HAVE A SAFE DELIVERY!!!!! xoxoxoxoxoxoxox|`|QCvh40NIaa	I believe it is possible for them to turn again, but i think its pretty unusual at the later stages :) x|`|9W7ZwOsVaa	its spelt "know" not "no"
o2YHnKXiaa	Yes I have been to Charleston SC airport and there family restroom was excellent also Atlanta GA airport family restrooms are even better :) I live in Ga and have traveled with my son who is 7 months old and he loves them bathrooms as much as I do LOL.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	Sadly it is hard to find good family restrooms. Our local mall has the best one around but it is always so busy!<br>  <br>  Most of the time they are small scary places, which make me happy my kids are a little older and can use the regular ones now LOL|`|387493774383e79967205158ff9bb074aa	I've seen some good ones in IKEA stores.<br>  Good family rooms are great.<br>  Square one mall is Mississauga has some pretty good ones too.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	When I was at Calgary airport back in september, I was able to use the family nursing room.  There was no toilet, but there was a very long changing spot, sink, and a comfortable rocking chair with high arms, which is great for me.  There was very dim lighting and it was extremely quiet. My only complaint was that it seemed that no one was taking care of the room because the dirty diaper smell was fairly strong.<br>  It was nice though, because I was able to calm my son down and get him to sleep before our next flight.
SaX09eNtaa	My daughter is 11 months old and has had problems eating stage 3 foods (some of them).  The mac n' cheese and Rice dinners especially.  She would throw them up.  It's the combo of chunks mixed with the thickened food, she would always gag.  My Dr said her babies did it too.  She is actually old enough to eat cooked veggies and soft fruits or feed her the stage 2.  Also, when they are teething their gag reflexes are also sensitive which could cause this also.|`|d942a137c6eecec81731fde38d574760aa	my thought would be that maybe she is over-full. After she eats and starts moving around, it comes back up on her. Another possibility is that it could be a stomach virus. That will pass and as long as she is hydrated without a fever, I really wouldn't worry too much. Try giving her some pedia lite to make sure she doesn't become dehydrated. Is she vomiting or just spitting up? If symptoms don't become better within a week, I would take her to her pediatrician.|`|RAT3mDbUaa	Sounds like a stomach bug. Is she throwing up after nursing? You might want to get some pedialyte in case, so you can at least let her keep that down, even if she wont keep the breastmilk down. Gotta keep her hydrated. PLENTY of fluids.|`|iVzs27Eaaa	you should go to the doctor|`|hMF3kg3Baa	The could just have a stomach bug. You do not always have a fever when you have a tummy bug. But i would take her to her DR and get her checked out just in case. Also I would feed some solids like crackers or something like that to see if she hold it down, and if she can then give her the regular food.|`|jUQaEPwdaa	I would think she is too young to have solids just stick with the oat meals and cereals.... My cousin had the same problem with solid foods at 7 months so i would stay away from solids and if she continues to throw up call a doctor
ByoYmFsBaa	You're not thinking of Progesterone, right? Or Clomid (clomiphene citrate), which gives Progesterone to sometimes help prevent a miscarriage.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure. Hope you find what you're looking for. :-)|`|xmVGViPiaa	The only thing I know of that they can give you to avoid a miscarriage is progesterone.  Whatever you are talking about doesn't sound like it is too good to take if it effects the nervous system in your baby, anyways.|`|c4NZ9Hdtaa	progesterone suppositoris is the medication  is the one ffrom the late 80s through prescription u would have to ask the doctor for it 
xmVGViPiaa	I had cramps until I was 10 weeks pregnant.  As long as it's not extreme or accompanied by blood you should be fine.<br>  <br>  Also about the morning sickness, try to eat whatever you think will stay in your tummy.  For me it was watermelon and watery fruits.  I also liked ice cold water (but some people may get sick from that as it can cause your tummy to spasm).<br>  <br>  I hope you start feeling better.  It's a trial and error thing - different things work for different people.  |`|I7myOp8Qaa	You might want to check with your doctor on this one. Getting cramping every day is not really a good sign so have yourself checked out. Good luck.
zwJbUbWMaa	This was happening in my teeth and jaw recently.  I am 27 weeks and I was told that these bone aches were due to a lack of calcium.  When the baby isn't getting enough calcium she will take it from you.  I went to the pharmacy and they have these chocolate and caramel calcium chews and if you take 2 a day it will give you 100% of your daily calcium.  It took 2 days for the pain to go completely away.|`|03f100b7d34df8ee17796e093fefa637aa	I have had the almost exact same thing happed to me.  I didn't get the pain in my arm but the exact same way you described it in your legs I use to get in mine.  I talked to my doctor about it and they suggested me taking Citrical.  So, I have been taking that and I get the pain every now and then but it isn't as bad.  Maybe you can ask your doctor about taking citrical and maybe that will help you.  Good luck!|`|QLopvWKDaa	Yes- it could be from pregnancy!  <br>  <br>  It is possible that it is your sciatic nerve inflames from pressure on it.  My doctor taught me a position called a "pelvic tilt", which is basically just lifting the painfully leg up, knee bent, to lighten the pressure.  <br>  <br>  If seated, just prop you feet up so that your knees are a bit higher than your hips. A warm bath make help as well- not hot-warm.<br>  <br>  Since this type of pain could also be from circulation problems- call your doctor or nurse and run your symptoms by them- just in casies!
d942a137c6eecec81731fde38d574760aa	1. it takes around 24-72 hours for the egg to be fertilized.<br>  2. you can take most test before you even miss your next period. Max is usually about 5 days before.<br>  3. morning sickness doesn't occur in everyone. Every woman and every pregnancy is different.<br>  4. If you're Christian, than morally it is wrong for an abortion at any point. But most people will argue that abortions are only to be performed within the 1st 3 months of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  My advice.. please see a doctor and do research on abortions before you decide what to do about your possible child's life. It seems to me that you are young, and scared.. please seek the advice of someone you trust. Good luck and God Bless.|`|TFuCMwUWaa	1.If you were ovulating at the time or around the time of intercourse, the egg becomes fertilized, can take a few days.<br>  2.Tests work best when you have missed your period, some work up to 5 days prior, but for better accuracy I'd wait until you miss one.<br>  3.Morning sickness varies from pregnancy to pregnancy, I started with morning sickness at 4 weeks, many start at 5-8 weeks.<br>  4. No answer|`|NOQ0fyBiaa	1. It takes about 10 days... <br>  2. It would be accurate three weeks after intercourse.<br>  3.morning sickness kicks in about 3 weeks to 1 mth later. May vary from girl to girl.<br>  4. 5 - 9 weeks the latest.<br>  But if my advice may be taken. Please don't consider it. I had one done and the feelings afterwards are horrible. I regret 100% what I did. Get help if ur scared!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.... and if the test results come to be negative please take care ok. Good luck. I hope I helped.
ubkt5RQiaa	Just try to keep down some mild things like crackers and ginger ale.  Lots of people actually lose weight in the beginning of pregnancy because morning sickness can make it hard to keep things down.  Just make sure you aren't dehydrated, and get fluids and you should be fine.  Good luck!|`|X6as2nOAaa	Don't force yourself, the baby will be fine only if you don't eat anything for like a week straight. I could not eat from 6 weeks until about 5 1/2 months everything made me throw up and my baby is just fine and is very healthy. Congrats and good luck!|`|kiznZMn5aa	You can start prenatal vitamins now with an over the counter formula, and it won't hurt you if you aren't pregnant but it will help your baby (if there is one).<br>  Besides that, obviously you have to eat to to live, so for now, just do your best. Crackers and tea, slightly flat 7Up, toast, Popsicles and other 'sick' foods are all better than nothing. Try eating in very small batches - two or three crackers and a couple of sips of water, tea, etc. once an hour or so. Anything healthy that you can keep down would be an added bonus.<br>  If in two weeks the doctor confirms you are pregnant and you still aren't keeping much down, talk to him about solutions for your nausea. There are medications they can prescribe or they may have other suggestions to help you through this.|`|xmVGViPiaa	If you aren't eating you are just going to feel more and more sick.  What is causing you to feel like throwing up is the effect of the hormones on your body and low blood sugar.  Try eating a few crackers and sipping some cold water or fizzy ginger ale.  It's not fun but you have to force yourself to eat while you are pregnant.  I had to force myself to eat for the first 5 months I was pregnant, you will feel better if you eat (even if you have to throw up).|`|OuuYoSBeaa	have you taken a pregnancy test? if doc suspects pregnancy, why would he wait 2 weeks for a test instead of giving you a blood test now?<br>  Dont force yourself to eat if you dont feel good. just have light snacks like crackers or toast and keep hydrated|`|U0iqktu8aa	You have to eat something... try crackers and juice or milk.  I'm 35 weeks and I am still getting sick..  Some of us aren't so luck.  Hopefully you will feel better soon and congratulations if you are!|`|Gg4ZTZ3saa	At least eat crackers and drink sprite or gingerale. I didn't eat anything but that really for about two weeks. I actually lost weight those two weeks. It's normal to get sick and to lose weight at first, so long as you start gainging it. I'd give a time period but everyone is different. I got sick around 6 weeks or so, for only a couple weeks. Only threw up once, but stayed nauseus with a loss of apetite. But like I said at least eat crackers and drink sprite. It's easy to keep down, and keeps something in your body. Makes you less nauseus.|`|hZj0Q83qaa	when my mom was pregnant with me she couldn't even eat a Popsicle.  But she said you should eat it even if you throw it up because you absorb some of the nutrients before you throw it up.  But that's just my mom.
9rLi9pSRaa	When I was 13 and in grade 9 they tried to box us into categories to see what aptitudes we all had.  Math, music , or science.  Few really went into those  fields after.  I think it depends on the person.  Some 13 year olds have a yearning to study some topics and feel so strongly that they never waver and do well.  Others need time to mature and find their own way.  The generation of today needs to experience many more occupations than mine did.  I see the younger generation trying one experience,  working at it for while and mastering it and moving on.  So I don't think anyone should be "boxed" into one thing and labelled with a particular  occupation.  It is restricting and they should be left to mature and develop as many talents as they want.  Travel, volunteering with groups like Habitat for Humanity when they reach 18 can help develop skills and a compassion for others,  and insights sometimes not discovered  in the University environment.  So the more options and experiences help to develop the psyche of today's youth into great leaders of the future.  Good luck with that. |`|a8IRxC4raa	Not until college.<br>  <br>  It's a big, wide, wonderful world out there. Don't box your child in at a young age.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|0t8XYZKRaa	No. His/her mind may change over the few years so you should intiate the career that a child is planning when the chhild is 16 or 15. That time the child will be much more serious and don't think stuffs like when they were young eg becoming the best spy in the world by not even training.|`|9f515ac764ea2076ccbfb3d6f3c39d43aa	its good that you are considering this because you still have time to narrow down on the subjects that you like and are good at to suit both your interests and your aptitude.

Baz Luhrman - 'Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)'<br>  <br>  You CANNOT decide a career for a child. Ever. The best you can do for him is to show him what is out there, let him choose for himself and, most of all, encourage whatever decision he makes.<br>  <br>  I left the civil engineering industry at the age of 27, became a policeman and finally, a paramedic. Why? Because I wanted to. Took big salary cut BUT, it was worth it. I am happy. <br>  <br>  You can have an aptitude for something but if you are not interested in the subject, you wont develop it|`|0ZUNdOHqaa	I believe a child can choose their career wisely from the age of 13. for instance many of today's musicians, actors, and models all started when they were very young!<br>  <br>  (i heard gavin degraw started when he was 8)!<br>  <br>  interest and aptitude may be two different things but if someone really wants to be something they can easily become what they want if they put their mind to it!|`|WQwLjJm9aa	This depends...See how it acts , talks , speaks...If he seems mature enough from it's speaking and it's really saying something smart about something(don't know what)...Maybe he can , or is shy to tell...If not and acts like a child then don't waste his childes...<br>  |`|3ZpUqpyJaa	the child is only 13, maybe you could throw around some serious ideas for careers based on the childs skill but v3 is to young|`|JAaTuIAgaa	definitely not<br>  <br>  his too young to make a decision yet and he will probley change his mind by then <br>  <br>  |`|So7zANmDaa	HELLS YEAH!
RKV8bro3aa	Lanolin cream - can be used in the weeks before the baby is born and then applied after each feed to help ease the pain.  We were all told to use it in our antenatal class.  My sister nurses in a neonatal unit and they also encourage their mothers to use it.|`|FSPAKELyaa	hi there, if it hurt you that badly the first two times, i think you may want to talk to your main carer and after baby is born have someone spend a little time showing you how to attatch baby properly. it really should not hurt that bad if baby is positioned right.<br>  |`|1IDSGM71aa	Nope, sorry. And if you try, it can honestly cause more pain later on because your breasts will be so irritated. I'm breastfeeding and it's horrible (for me personally,and IDK what I'm doing wrong) even now, a month postpartum. Hang in there, and remember it isn't supposed to hurt after the first few days.|`|xmVGViPiaa	There really is no way to toughen up your breasts before you lactate.  Most of the care to ease and prevent pain happens during lactation.  Speak with a lactation consultant, or talk to your OB they may have some advice for you.<br>  <br>  If it is your nipples that hurt then wear lanolin pads when you begin lactating.  You can also express a little bit of milk onto your nipples and rub that in it may help with the dry pain.<br>  You can also take tylenol while you are pregnant or lactating and you may use ice packs on your breasts.  |`|jSzKedTjaa	Breastfeeding should not be a painful experience at all if your baby is able to get a good latch.  I did not "prepare" my breasts before my baby and 15 months later I am still breastfeeding.  I haven't ever experienced pain or sore. However, I am aware that everyone's situation is different and as much as some people want to breastfeed, it doesn't work for everyone for many reasons.  <br>  <br>  What you can do to prepare is read information on breastfeeding, latching on, different breastfeeding positions, etc.  Knowledge is power.  <br>  <br>  Please try and enjoy your pregnancy for now and tackle the breastfeeding issue when the baby arrives.  Good luck!|`|irGE84Qdaa	i don't kno why ur last 2 pregnancy,s scared u alot but there is always a pain when u breast feed a child cause mine was sore alot and i could not do it,u should talk to ur DR about that hun so m i gonna do rite now i m 24 weeks with 2nd baby and 4th pregnancy.<br>  good luck|`|IOQfgE2caa	HI,<br>  There is no need to prepare your nipples...that's what my lactation consultant told. me. All you'll do is irritate them more before you have to nurse your baby. I nursed for 15 months and it was the BEST experience ever!!! I HIGHLY recommend it! <br>  Try to work with a lactation consultant or your delivery nurse from the first time you breastfeed your baby. If you can get the proper latch, it shouldn't be too painful. Of course, you (and your baby) won't be perfect at it right away, which will lead to some slip ups and sore nipples. After about a week, the pain decreases tremendously and it will be smooth sailing after that. Just think....no more bottles to clean, heat up, make, etc. <br>  I hope you loved it as much as I did! Good luck! |`|91x3trOnaa	Not a stupid question!  I tried to toughen up my nipples, but let me tell you there is nothing that can prepare them for the 24/7 hungry baby attack!  <br>  <br>  Just be prepared for a couple more months of discomfort after the birth.  But breastfeeding is 100% worth it!! :)|`|AA11955815	Breast feeding should not be painful unless you have mastitis, when your in the hospital having your baby do not be embarrassed to ask for a lactation nurse to come in and show you how to attach your baby properly.<br>  Its quite difficult when your baby is small and its confused why is cant have any milk and you are confused why your baby cant get any, the best thing to do is relax, and take your time, once you get the hang of it you will wonder what all the fuss is about.<br>  If you get sore nipples you can use a breast and nipple cream from the chemist and it will put moisture back into your dry nipple or for a more natural and free approach is to squeeze a bit of milk onto your nipples and let it air dry, it takes away the pain almost instantly.<br>  <br>  Also the first premilk that comes in the first few days in quite essential it has alot of nutrients your new baby needs.<br>  <br>  Ive breast feed 5 child and 1 lot were twins by the time I managed to wean them they were 18 months and I felt like a cow, but it was the best thing I ever did. None of my children have been seriously sick and breast milk is free.<br>  <br>  Oh and one more point always bring the baby to the breast not the breast to the baby, this way to will have a better latch, and as long as your chest and your babies chest touch you know you are holding your baby in the right position.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
ftAcJy2Iaa	Im experiencing alot of BH myself.. I am 39 weeks and 2 days pregnant and I am frankly fed up.. <br>  The nurse at the maternity ward told me to lay on my left side that if the contractions do stop then they are BH. If they progress no matter in what position you turn then they are real contractions!|`|jfABMUJcaa	Ahhh, I remember well that last few weeks before my daughter was born.  I thought I was in labor everyday!  Everyone told me that I would know when it happened and that is what I'll echo.  Real labor contractions are so much stronger than BH.  Also, dilation isn't always a sure sign.  I was dilated to a 4 and 90% effaced for about 2 weeks before my doctor induced me.  Isn't the suspense agonizing?  Enjoy your last few nights of semi-uninterrupted slumber!|`|go2qKKf2aa	Birth is likely close!  Enjoy these last few hours/days of prenancy!  Have sex to speed things up.  Seriously.  As for the actual contractions/labor, you will definitely know when it's time to go to the hospital!|`|pA1eomsvaa	take a warm bath! Go for a brisk walk. drink plenty of water.|`|xmVGViPiaa	It sounds like you are getting close but not quite there yet!  Do some walking - it will help you dilate and you may actually speed up your labor.|`|28bff668329cb0e01d8580a3e8d7d868aa	sounds like it's getting close
0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	Yup, take cod liver oil (it comes in capsules) - take a couple of capsules twice a day - in addition to your prenantal vitamins.  Also, take a B Complex and additional B12 - get a B12 that melts under your tongue.<br>  <br>  Pregnancy has a very high nutrition draw - if you are feeling weak and tired, then these are the vitamins to take.<br>  <br>  If you want you could also go get Bolthouse Farms Green Goodness juice, which looks gross, but is actually very tasty.  Or, you could go to a health food store and buy some of those powders to make a green drink.  These always give me a lot of energy when I am feeling weak a tired, which I do a lot (not pregnant, just not healthy).|`|AA11210211	Apple juice,It works better than coffee and is better for you when you are pregnant.|`|xmVGViPiaa	Eat some fruit.<br>  Also, are you taking an iron supplement?  Fatigue can be a sign that you are not getting enough iron.  Fatigue is normal in the first and third trimesters, but extreme fatigue may be a sign that you need a little more.|`|TJZVuWwgaa	I know it sounds harsh but the best way to boost your energy is to do some exercise. It's really difficult to make yourself do it in the first place but trust me, once you have you'll feel so much better for it!|`|rsEK17n1aa	I been complaining about the same thing but my last visit to the dr my iron levels are low so they put me on the iron pill but I still feel the same way.|`|o5OK3g3Haa	Take it easy, I think it is natural to feel exhausted during pregnancy.
rqwXqmyTaa	My cousin used castor oil, and all that happened was she was on the toilet all day miserable.  Doctors suggest not doing it, can you imagine being in labor and pooping the whole time?  The only reason why you would get contractions is because of the diareah, the catrol oil causes, and dehydration.|`|AA12089586	Sorry, the only thing I've heard about castor oil is it will give you diarrhea and cause bowel cramps...<br>  Plus that and fact that i wouldn't even try it in the first place as it's not natural!<br>  I sure hope you go into labor soon!<br>  Good luck!|`|K9kN68fwaa	I've never tried castor oil. I wouldn't try it again, it seems to be upseting your stomach. I understand the last week of your pregnancy goes slower than the whole 9 month pregnancy. The thing that made me start having labor contractions was to schedule a c-section just incase I didn't start having them on my own. I went into labor that day. Bad nerves.|`|b9c7c5fa46b66ed3c5a45ba32223bf17aa	I have never had to use caster oil, I had a lot of sex, and then finally, one night I was having sex and the next day my water broke, caster oil is dangerous, but hopefully this advice will work. good luck.|`|1dCWMzbraa	The point of the oil is to cause your bowels to move, thus allowing your muscles to contract to cause labor. I would not try it again- many people do use oil multiple times, to no avail.
HXfHkoSHaa	My hips and back hurting so much that I couldn't get comfy to sleep at night.  Then I had my beautiful boy, and he keeps me up.  Oh well, one day I'll sleep the night through again.<br>  <br>  Worth every waking hour.|`|LXc9tGJVaa	Hardest part(s) would be:<br>  Always worrying if something would be wrong with my baby when she is born<br>  <br>  Feeling huge and uncomfortable and not being able to sleep<br>  <br>  But I know it's going to be worth it; I'm getting induced on Thursday! I can't wait to meet my baby :)|`|k6HkVB5Yaa	well if you have other kids, then keeping up with them is very difficult. If not the hardest part would be many things but are all different for different woman. I had alot of back pain, causing me to have sleepless nights, i also hated the whole peeing 3-4 times in the middle of the night. But absolutely the hardest part is labor and delivery-hands down. <br>  <br>  100 percent worth every aching minute and i'd do it again in a heartbeat.<br>  <br>  mommy of 2 boys|`|wrmfcBpLaa	The hardest part is the hormonal crazies that affect almost every part of life... crying, sometimes literally, at the drop of a hat... <br>  <br>  Also, the physical changes that go on with how big I get. Yikes!|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	The hardest part was (is) not being able to get comfortable enough to sleep, but I already know that it will be worth it!!|`|eemmWU0Haa	always feeling tired and sick and really bitchy!|`|PoAiGIUDaa	I think the hardest part for me was the "all day" sickness in the beginning of my pregnancy, and the actual labor in the end. I was induced and went through 36 hours of hard labor and ended up having a c-section. It was all worth it in the end when I got to see my baby boy :) He's 3 now, and I want another one so bad!|`|vSZ3ERvfaa	To me the hardest part of being pregnant so far are my emotions. Throughout my whole pregnancy I been going through a lot of things on and off and causes me to be really hormonal sometimes it's crazy!! And I just hate it because I'm afraid of how it affects my baby. And of course it's worth it!! I just wish I can handle my feelings more better.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and accepting my new body<br>  My lil baby is giving me stretchmarks!! =(|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	EFF YES IT WAS WORTH IT!<br>  <br>  worse part was the third trimester, its a tie between horrible heartburn, so painful i thought i was going to die! and second was the pelvic pain, i couldn't even walk very far without having to stop! oh and i couldn't even turn over in bed it hurt so bad!|`|Q6YboW9Daa	Only 8.5 weeks so far and my biggest challenge has been the morning sickness and complete exhaustion.

iAgqikL7aa	I completely understand your wanting to try everything, but overdoing it and stressing too much can also prevent you from conceiving. I know how difficult the waiting is but you will get pregnant again soon!!<br>  <br>  One thing that worked for me both times was grapefruit juice. For my first pregnancy the cycle that I started drinking grapefruit juice every day I got pregnant. That was our 6th cycle of trying. For my second pregnancy I just happened to be craving grapefruit that month and had eaten a fresh grapefruit every day and we got pregnant our first cycle.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|xmVGViPiaa	Are you sure you are ovulating yet?  After a miscarriage many womens' cycles are irregular.  You may either not be ovulating yet or you might not be ovulating on time.  It's probably a good idea to get an ovulation predictor and start using it to track down if you are actually ovulating... But your cycle should return to normal soon, too.  Good luck, I hope you get it this month!|`|oheLrTb8aa	my hub and i had a miscarriage about 5 months ago.  sorry for your loss.  ok, we tried things like every odd day.  like we would take fertility drugs, i cant think of the name of it, but you only took it during days 5-10, which is your 5th day of your period until the 10 day.  no sex until the 11th day, then every other day until the 21st day.  if this is confusing i will try to explain better.  the med starts with a p, i know its not provera, but maybe your obgyn can tell you what it is. you can only start out on 50 mgs.  ok when you get your period, this is day one. then you wait until day 5 of your bleeding to take the meds and you take them day 6 7 8 9 10. no sex on days 5-10. then sex every other day starting day 11-21.  take a test on day 28 or 30.  this recipe worked for me.  you can do this even without any fertility drugs. if you get some progesterone gel (i think progesterone is the name of the pill) and rub some on you during your cycle until day 13 (in different spots of your body) this will help with your chances too.  i know this is alot of information, but my hub and i have memorized everything about this stuff.  we are not trying again until after the first of the year. ask your doctor if there are any more questions. you are most fertile day 10-20, but chances are better if you try 11-21. regardless of fertility probs or not! hope this helps<br>  <br>  <br>  the fertility med was called clomid
NaJPIOheaa	hey dear... honestly we can't tell you, because everybody is different, but i have heard of many ladies with pcos conceive naturally. there is medicine out there that can help you ovulate, such as clomid, and metformin helps also. there is also herbs that have helped ladies with pcos, such as agnus castus(vitex)... when you are ready to have a baby it might take longer to conceive, and more hard work such as charting and waiting.. good luck in the future hun! xo|`|cd7a815aadd36875b0d7dabeed6e75bfaa	Many women with PCOS struggle to conceive naturally, but many have very few problems at all.

SRsFkNBBaa	your best bet-is to spill the beans. here is the problem-you will have this "friend" visit you every month , so you want to freak out every month when your period comes? someone will need to take you to the store, and give you money to help with your period.<br>  your brother, is mature and old enough to handle this. he loves you, and if he has a pregnant girlfriend-trust me he has had experience with periods. <br>  when you go to the store, look for pads that say "regular" on the package or box-take in about 5$-6$ with you, and get a large pack. that way, you might have a little left over to use next time. your brother doesn't even need to go in with you, have him drop you off. you don't even really have to exactly tell him-just say "hey, i need to go to the store. can i have $5 or $6 , its for "girly stuff" if you know what i mean", i gaurantee you, he will be happy to help.<br>  you can also time when your period will be coming also, count 28 days from the first day that you start each month, so if you got your period today, you will probably start again around the 3rd of april. make sure you always have an extra pad in your purse, so if you start at school, you aren't stuck. and the 28 day thing isn't exact, that is just the normal time fram for most women-good luck, sweetie, and don't sweat it!|`|Ggi2Upo0aa	When you can, try to go to the shop and get some pads and dont be embarrased every girl has to go through it!

bv4ZEl4Saa	I couldn't take any of the vitamins with fish, either, they made me positively ill and I could not keep them down!  I still gag when I think about them! <br>  <br>  Enfamil makes a non-fish DHA supplement called Expecta that you can take with regular prenatal vitamins that don't have DHA.  <br>  <br>  I found it hard to find just the regular prenatals that didn't have any fish oil, but Walgreens makes a prenatal supplement pack that contains a non-fish DHA supplement just like Expecta and comes with vitamins that don't have any fish oil.

Besides the exhaustion, I was told that I was deficient in DHA from the pregnancy.  I'm taking the supplement now.|`|LhhXpO8Xaa	<br>  A lot of nuts have DHA in them. DHA is a form of a fatty acid, an omega 3 fatty acid to be exact. You can also take Cod liver oil pills found in your grocery vitamin section. However, ask your doctor first if this is ok for you to take. <br>  The link below lists some good sources of alternative DHA:<br>  <a href="http://www.allaboutvision.com/nutrition/fatty_acid_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutvision.com/nutrition/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  This link tells about DHA and the role in pregnancy and children:<br>  <a href="http://pregnancychildbirth.suite101.com/article.cfm/get_hooked_on_fish_oils" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancychildbirth.suite101.com/...</a><br>  <br>  You can also take an alge supplement that does not contain any fish.<br>  Got below from this  website <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NAH/is_n1_v27/ai_20152690" rel="nofollow">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0...</a><br>  <br>  DIETARY DHA The best dietary source of DHA is fresh cold-water fish, such as sardines, salmon, or tuna. If you don't eat fish, then seaweeds (such as hijiki, nori, and kombu) are a good source of DRA as well. A patent was recently issued for an algae-based chicken feed that is rich in DRA. Already on the market in Europe, the chicken feed, called DHA Gold, is expected to be sold in the United States by the first of 1998. Chicken meat raised on this feed contains five to seven times the DHA that normal chickens contain.<br>  <br>  Just search amazon.com or a vitamin store for algae supplements. Or you can cook seaweed yourself. The best place to buy seaweed is in a chinese grocery store. <br>  <br>  The Kombu above in the article is actually "dashi kombu" if you see seaweed that reads Kombu, you are actually supposed to make a broth out of it (dont eat the actual kombu seaweed) it's not bad for you or anything just really tuff to eat. But the broth contains a ton of nutrients great for pregnant women. |`|SJkhbRmSaa	Nope not bad. Some people dont take vitamins as they are sick and cant keep them down. Today they say its good to take the omega 3 fatty acid pills along with your prenatal vitamin as its good for you and the babies skin and possibly helps the baby avoid allergies etc. Tomorrow they may say, they do nothing. Just eat right and take a prenatal if u can. Its the folic acid they want you to have.|`|xmVGViPiaa	There is a vegetarian version of DHA supplement.|`|VwGYX8DZaa	i don't think its a necessary need you should just eat healthy to prevent being diabetic
O7SXDtBAaa	With my first son it was great! As soon as I had the epidural I got comfortable and in a short while (10 min.) couldn't feel anything.  I didn't start pushing for about 45 minutes so I was totally numb from the waist down.  The nurses had to tell me when to push and when to stop.  With my second son I had an epidural and started pushing after only about 15 minutes.  I could feel pressure and knew when to push, but it wasn't painful.  I am happy about my decision to have an epidural in both cases.  It allowed me to relax and enjoy the birth without worrying if the pain was going to increase or be too intense.  As crazy as it may sound, I really enjoyed experiencing the birthing process with both of my sons.  I hope you will too one day.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i heard you are numb . i did a natural birth so i am not sure i know u are in less control of the pushing|`|wFe7L1XJaa	Your completely numb from the waist down i didnt feel a thing when i had my son and my mom had to move my legs for me because i was so numb ITS GREAT!!|`|c5AJGcYcaa	having the epidural takes the edge off, altho i still knew when it was time to push, all of a sudden I felt a lot of pressure and i thought that the epidural was no longer working.

8fac6f09ffcd25fcc175c21086ddbc13aa	Unfortunately, she isn't going to listen to anything you have to say.  Look up the symptoms of a sociopath... I'm sure she fulfills the criteria.  The only thing you can do is inform CPS of her drug and alcohol use, let them know you are concerned for the baby and her ability to care for a baby.  This way they can investigate while the baby is still in the hospitals care.  I don't know how large the town is where you live, but, you can let the nurses in your birthing class know that she may be delivering there and to be prepared.<br>  <br>  <br>  good call on the munschausen syndrome---  that's a serious thing to watch out for when the baby does arrive|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	she knows she is jsut a fool . poor baby . i would inform child protection about her  I dont think she can make her baby come early <br>  i am sure her dr it wise to her if not call them|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I don't think there is anything you can do or say to this girl.  She obviously needs CONSTANT attention.  The sad thing is that if she has a preemie baby and the baby has health issues she knows she'll get attention for that even though its her unfortunate lifestyle that would bring this on to the baby.  I have a feeling when the baby does get here it will only be a tool for attention and tantrums.  This girl is not mentally stable and really there is nothing youc an do to convince her of anything...her distorted thinking is perfectly logical in her head.  What you may want to do is see if there is steps your brother can take in order to get custody of his baby...unless he too is unstable in which maybe your parents can get involved.  Its really a sad situation because this girl would rather have an unhealthy baby to take any possible attention away from you.  There's nothing cute or exciting about having a premature baby.  Its often hard and heart breaking for parents that go thru it and a struggle for the baby often.  She's stupid and its bothersome that so many people want kids and can't get pregnant while nutcase druggies like that can get pregnant every other month if they choose ...UGH.  Good luck to your family...with this chick you'll need it.|`|9776485a7510046fa4388cd98356e6d6aa	WOW ...<br>  Maybe as a good citizen that you are maybe turn her in for child endangerment .<br>  She does not deserve to have a baby.|`|AA10458750	That girl sounds like a hot mess!! Shouldn't your brother in law be with your sister anyway not a gf? Well anyway, all you can do is worry about you & your baby, not hers.|`|Fa130w6Gaa	Wow! She sounds very messed up! I have a feeling you aren't going to be able to convince her that having a preemie is bad. The only thing I can think of is if  you are able to have her talk to parents of preemies or take her to see a NICU. You won't be able to go inside it and see the babies up close but you could probably peek through the windows and see them. It sounds as if she has some major entitlement issues and needs a shrink! Good luck and congrats on YOUR pregnancy! Hope things go well for you!|`|hSJnaysiaa	...and your main concern should be yourself and your own pregnancy.<br>  <br>  She may or may not be making the same decisions you would make, or even smart decisions, but she is an adult and sadly, there is nothing you or anyone else can do to make her change.<br>  <br>  Yes, its frustrating because at this point she isn't the only one being hurt by her choices, that baby is too, but again, she's the only one that can control that. And honestly, hasseling her about stuff may make it worse. <br>  <br>  From what I've seen through life is that hypochondriacs (possibly spelled wrong) are usually up for anything that will get them attention. So the more attention you give to her bad eating habits, lack of weight gain, drugs and drinking, the more she will do it.<br>  <br>  I would just ignore her.<br>  <br>  But don't think you know what's best for her situation either. Its between her and her doctor, and if the doctor has concerns he will deal with them. Its just not your place.<br>  <br>  And if it makes you feel better I am 36 weeks along (almost 37...about to pop) and have only gained 10 pounds the entire pregnancy. Everyone is different.|`|72Fjnwz9aa	I may be off but it sounds has though she needs a mental medical intervention. But unfortunately there is nothing you can do at this moment...except tell her doctor you suspect her of using drugs while pregnant, they will test her. I don't know about where you live but here if you go into premature labor they will automatically test you. They will then call Child Protective services. Don't be afraid to call them yourself if you see any of this when the baby does come. But it sounds like if she is doing all of this now she will have a preemie..I am actually kind of blown away that she wants a preemie...she sounds as if she could have Munchhausen by Proxy....this is a serious mental disorder where a person will hurt themselves or others to gain attention. I think I miss spelled it. I really hope this helps. Good luck.|`|mLbydsVIaa	wow that girl has aloootttt of issues she needs to fix... serious issues.<br>  this girl needs to realize her baby being preemie isnt good for it and puts it through alot of procedures that are scary to the baby... and plus if it preemie she wont get to take it home for a while! why would she want that.?? i think thats crazy... i mean ive heard of ppl wanting a small baby,...a baby thats healthy and born on time... but a preemie?? <br>  she has alot to learn.<br>  you should show her the videos on youtube of babies born at 6 -7 months...that way she can see what there is to go through,.. and sometimes..not every baby lives.so it seems lke with what all she is harming her body with she could lose this baby too...and if it is born preemie it will probably have more problems than it just being preemie.<br>  do all you can to prove her that preemies are not something she should try to have... and help her eat right and find a way for her to get off the drugs and all the stuff she does that harms her and the baby.<br>  btw...whats her family doing?? do they even care or seem to know whats  going on with her??<br>  i hope she gets help and her and the baby are ok..and she gives birth on time,..<br>  god bless srry if my answer was no good help.<br>  <br>  <br>  btw you should call CPS and let them know whats going on so they can try to help her too...

wCXTazrPaa	You are probably being teased. Continue ignoring them unless they exceed your comfort zone.|`|MIUzgwsTaa	Wow, They sound immature.<br>  Bullying people is so middle school.<br>  And don't ignore them, because putting your hands on someone isn't right and they can actually get themselves into trouble for constantly physically bullying you.<br>  The case is called physically harassment, and many students get kicked out for that kind out for that kind of stuff!<br>  But if I was in that situation what I would do is tell them <br>  "I am not your child so don't put your hand or any other part of your body on me! You need to grow up, and get real sweetie, this is highschool school maby you need to check into middle school if you think bullying a girl will make you tough, well last time I checked bullying a girl only shows how weak you are!" And I would scream it really loud, and if they bump into me I would punch them in the face and if I get in trouble I would simply call it self-defense.|`|SRteXuP3aa	neither, you are being bullied. try to find some friends even if they are "geeky"...actually "geeks" make awesome friends if you ask me. don't curse just say "just leave me alone" or glare and make a serious face.|`|Fc2DkArMaa	DO NOT IGNORE HIM!!!

This simple, free play activity is great for mastering his gross motor skills (activities using the large muscles of the body). From the age of 3 to 5 years, it's good to encourage him to participate in activities that involve climbing, jumping, running, pushing, pulling, exploring, spinning, dancing and imaginative play. Allow him to use his imagination and make up games and activities, but help him by providing simple props such as cardboard boxes, hula-hoops, a sandpit, cushions, balls and buckets. Also, check out what’s available in your local area, whether it is an organiZed session held every week, such as modified gymnastics programs or swimming classes (visit your local YMCA to see what programs they offer).|`|kZzasq1laa	Playdoh, catch, eat chicken, make a fort, play with action figures, color, play with balloons, dress up, make weird noises, play with cars, run around, tickle them, play hide and seek, make a video where they can see themself, go to the park, buy a puppy, bake cookies, and act like animals.|`|G9wEDvedaa	take him/her to the park<br>  colour with crayons<br>  teach them things like counting, abc's, singing<br>  hide and seek<br>  read to them<br>  play with blocks or with toys<br>  playdoh if your very careful monitoring them and making sure he/she doesnt eat it<br>  bake cupcakes and let them help decorate them with frosting<br>  sports like soccer or catch|`|5rV95B9jaa	WHAT TO DO WITH A TODDLER (age one to three)<br>  <br>  This age group is into everything. One second they are pulling all of the books off the shelves and the next second they are in your purse and taking apart your wallet. The youngest toddlers can entertain themselves by trying to assemble plastic food containers. As they get closer to three, toddlers like stacking blocks and dressing dolls, or playing with clay and coloring. They still are at the age that they're playing beside other kids but not really with them.<br>  <br>  Games and songs for one-year-olds: <br>  <br>  Ring Around the Rosie <br>  Peek-a-Boo <br>  Patty Cake <br>  This Little Piggy Went to Market <br>  <br>  Kids love to make noise. If you can find a wooden spoon or any kind of spoon and a cardboard box, they'll create their own music. But hold your ears! <br>  -Dawn <br>  <br>  Games for one- to three-year olds:<br>  <br>  Hide and Seek <br>  Mother, May I? <br>  Duck, Duck, Goose <br>  Statues <br>  Red Light, Green Light <br>  Simon Says <br>  <br>  It seems that most kids love to build forts. All you need are a couple of blankets or sheets, and some chairs or a table. Then you can pretend to be pirates, or Peter Pan and Wendy, or Davy Crockett. For an extra-special treat, let them eat snacks inside their fort. <br>  -Logan <br>  <br>  Songs for one- to three-year-olds:<br>  <br>  The Wheels on the Bus<br>  <br>  This Old Man <br>  <br>  Where Is Thumbkin?<br>  <br>  The Itsy Bitsy Spider<br>  <br>  Old MacDonald<br>  <br>  The Hokey Pokey<br>  <br>  I like to put on music and dance. Sometimes we pretend we're butterflies. Sometimes we tie towels or scarves around our shoulders and play super heroes flying through the air. <br>  -Jessi<br>  <br>  Books for this age:<br>  <br>  For one-year-olds: Any books with animal pictures and animals sounds. They also like the Find the Puppy (Duck or Kitty) books by Stephen Cartwright. And board books are great!<br>  <br>  For all toddlers: <br>  Go Dog Go by P.D. Eastman <br>  We're Going on a Bear Hunt by Helen Oxenbury <br>  The Cat in the Hat (or anything) by Dr. Seuss <br>  Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak <br>  <br>  (This is just a place to start. Go to the library and pick your own books. Kids like ones with fun pictures and lots of repetition.)|`|FLAtdWrmaa	Carpet races -- bodies, balls, paper airplanes, baby toys, etc.<br>  <br>  Build walls and then crash them down (I saved & cleaned old 1-qt milk cartons for this -- squish the triangular end flat, close with a bit of duct tape -- build away -- lightweight, safe, & recyclable in the end)<br>  <br>  Dancing.

And/or hand-painting, leg-painting, etc.<br>  <br>  "Go camping" in a tent in the living room or backyard, or on the porch/deck.  Have a make-believe campfire.  "Toast" marshmallows.  Drink out of water bottles.  Sit in folding camp/beach chairs. Use flashlights, even if it's daytime (the ones with yellow- or red-flashing lights are appealing, as are the noisy wind-up flashlights with no batteries).  Tell or read ghost stories.  Sing goofy campfire songs.  Use binoculars if you have any (or make toy ones out of cardboard tp/paper-towel tubes).  Keep "field notes."  "Watch" the sunrise or the sunset (you describe it to them as a sort of story).  Have breakfast or marshmallows in front of the tent afterwards (even if it's 4 pm).<br>  <br>  Teach him/her knock-knock jokes.  Though you may later regret this.<br>  <br>  Cook.  There are great recipe sites on the internet -- start with no-heat recipes, graduate to simple microwave scratch recipes.  Milk jellies and finger-jello are always popular.<br>  <br>  Go for walks.  Collect stuff, and "organize" the collections when you get home, or use them in artworks.  Compartmented boxes from fishing stores/departments work great for pebbles, bugs, nuts and galls, shells, etc.<br>  <br>  Three is a great age!

RHX1yFb5aa	My parents were never my friend growing up but they were very understanding and I could go to them about anything.  I feel it was a good thing because I understood that they were the PARENT and I was the child. I had no bargaining power and once a decision was made, it might as well have been written in stone.  They were strict and I didn't always understand their reasoning, but now that I am a parent myself I understand a lot better, and actually thank them for being so hard on me. <br>  <br>  Example: when I was 15 I wanted to spend the night w/a friend. My mom did not know her mom so she said no but if my friend wanted to stay with me that was fine. I got so mad at my mom!! Then when I was 23 my (now ex) husband's cousin whose mother was her "friend", then 15yo, went to stay with one of her friends and the mother of the friend drugged them and sold them for crack! nine months later woke up with a severe stomach ache and her mom took her to the ER. She had a baby!  No one knew she was prego, not even her cause she had her periods the whole time she was pregnant.  Looking back it could have been me as my friends mom it turns out was the same way.|`|AA12221392	my mom was always my friend ,but as well as the parent. She made me feel I could tell her anything , but she would still give me consquences for my actions. My dad he was just a parent. He tried to be our friend but it wasn't as easy for me to talk to him. <br>  My parents and I are still very close. I have become closer to my dad as a adult,but still very close to my mom as well.<br>  <br>  I think it was a good thing. As long as parents know that they have to be the parent first, I think it is good for your kids to see you as a friend as well.|`|lFenXNCzaa	Not like how parents today try to be "friends" with their kids.

You should buy her a hair product (it doesn't necessarily have to be one that removes spit) to show how bad you feel about spitting in her gorgeous hair. Get her Bumble & Bumble leave-in conditioner, Garnier Fructis de-frizzer, or Biosilk silk drops. You could even take her to the mall to get a quick shampoo, cut, style, and blow dry at Bubbles or the Hair Cuttery. Also, I would do a little research on what products can get shoe polish off walls.

4t5eGShiaa	The hospital has everything you need for your baby. (Formula - if not BF, diapers, wipes, creams, shirts, receiving blankets, hats) <br>  <br>  But here is what you should bring..<br>  <br>  For you:<br>  CAMERA!!!<br>  Going home outfit<br>  Slippers<br>  Toothbrush/tooth paste<br>  Brush/hair ties<br>  Socks<br>  Maybe a book or board game<br>  <br>  For Baby:<br>  Car seat<br>  Going home outfit|`|b0e9ea8aa843686326e2afbe57d49ddaaa	Honestly all those fancy lists are dumb, all you really need is a pair of PJs for yourself , undies and a bra , socks, an outfit for the baby and your toiletries ( tooth brush, toothpaste, deodorant ..) and if you think you like listening to music bring an ipod or cd player but you might not use it depends on your labor!|`|uJJPFJoyaa	Best to pack now a little ahead in time just in case. Pack up a set of clothing for you, night wear, 1 set of baby clothing, tooth brush, tooth paste, hair brush & comb, camera.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	A pillow, 2 nightgowns that open in the front if you are breastfeeding, your normal toiletries like shampoo body wash, toothbrush and paste, hairbrush, nursing bra and pads, maxi pads for the bleeding, a robe to wear around if you plan on walking, slippers with non-skid bottoms, panties (preferably loose fitting granny ones, lol) An outfit to wear home for you and the baby, magazines or a book....snacks if you don't like the hospital food....and diaper bag, diapers, mits for the baby, receiving blankets.....still thinking....lol|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	yes u should i was goin to wait until 38 weeks went in at my 35 weeks app & delivered that day very smart to be way prepared<br>  <br>  night gowns 3 in case of longer stay due to csection<br>  pads<br>  clothes to wear home<br>  panties<br>  lotion<br>  baby's clothes <br>  baby blanket<br>  house shoes<br>  camera<br>  film if not digital batteries<br>  <br>  my hospital gave me shampoo & tooth brush with paste|`|kBcI3Uleaa	I didn't pack at all, I was waiting on my doc to induce me because I was 42 weeks along and I wasn't dialated. So I went to my appointment and had an aultr sound and the docter ran out of the room and rushed me up stairs because I had no anomic fluid surrounding the baby. And I was three hours away from home with NOTHING! but what was on my back. So yeah start packing. Usually his you are planning on having your baby vaginal you'll probably be in the hospital for three days. So I'd pack loose panties(cotton) , sports bra or nursing bra, loose pants like jogging pants,yoga pants,etc/ Like three to five pair. ( in case the baby pees on you or spits up) <br>  A couple loose shirts. I also packed a outfit for the last day that was really nice , so if I felt up to it I could get dressed up a little because I wouldn't have a big belly anymore in the way and do my make up and hair. ( But only if you feel like it) Believe me I was tired! <br>  Shampoo,conditioner ( the hospitals toilet trees are horrible) Tooth brush, tooth paste, anti bacterial soap like ( dove) <br>  Washcloth,towels. ( the hospital has towels but there tiny)<br>  Comb, hairbrush, hair ties.<br>  Comfy shoes or slippers.<br>  A couple things to do like: word search,pad of paper,pens, a book, and your contact list - so you can call everyone and share the wonderful news! <br>  Maybe a bathrobe( it's so much easier to go to the bathroom and breast feed if you have a robe.<br>  Then you want to think about packing the diaper bag!<br>  *Diapers and wipes<br>  *Receiving blankets<br>  *Hat<br>  *Little mittens( to protect them scratching there face)<br>  *Booties( to cover there feet)<br>  * Nail files& clippers<br>  *pacifier/binkey( If you choose too, I was so against it, then the second day of breastfeeding him my nipples were so sore because most of the time he wasn't even hungry he just wanted something to suck on, so I gave him a pacifier when my nipples started bleeding and he used it and he was great, he slept alot better and let me sleep, a month later he didn't want anything to do with it. He's fifteen months old now and he still has nothing to do with it)<br>  <br>  * Outfits for the day ( newborn/0-3 months old)<br>  *  2 PJ's<br>  *3 Osies ( I love the onsies)<br>  * Camera<br>  * Film<br>  * Desitin( Diaper rash cream, believe me when they start drinking your breast milk or formula there poop will change and the acid will give them a rash)<br>  <br>  * Gas-X ( little one's gas-x) I wish someone told me about this one! Boy with the changes they go through with there digestive system you are going to need the gas-x<br>  * Shamoo,soap,lotion,baby powder ( I bought the travelsize johnson johnson variety pack. It's less then five dollers and it comes with: Shampoo,baby wash,lotion,desitin,baby powder, and a bonus tube of aveeno oatmeal lotion. <br>  * Car Seat<br>  * Bottles<br>  <br>  Well Good luck! I might of had my mother in law pack alot but it's better to be safe then sorry!<br>  Good Luck!|`|apALY0sqaa	It varies based on the person- and what your stay may be like. I am having a planned c-section (for health) so my needs are mapped out and I know what I will need.<br>  <br>  For you, I would bring- a nightgown (easier to move and dress), a robe (if you leave your room), toiletries (hospital doesn't supply everything, or you have a preference), slippers/socks, your own pillow (great comfort item), a comfortable coming home outfit (maternity one- you'll still be swollen and look 5/6 months preggo), nursing bra if you're going to, make-up if you want it, and things to do during a long labor- book, music, cards (may come in handy if baby ends up in nursery and you have time to kill!<br>  <br>  Your spouse/significant other will need a few things as well- a change of clothes(so he doesn't have to go home), change for vending machines if it's late, packable snacks/food if it's late or a long labor, something for him to do as well (if you're reading, what will he do?), and a camera (don't 4get batteries/film!!)<br>  <br>  Baby will get most everything from the hospital, but you can bring onsies, hats, ect if you want your baby dressed the way you want, as well as blankets- but don't take anything that may be lost, otherwise a coming home outfit and a carseat and that will cover it. If you want to trim baby's nail's a hygiene/manicure kit will be in order.<br>  <br>  It seems like alot, but think overnight trip for you, and basic diaper bag for baby. Dad won't need alot of stuff, most will be used during labor outside of a change of clothes, and the camera will me used constantly!!! Enjoy your baby and good luck!!!!|`|28QPS6V9aa	You can start packing whenever you feel like it, personally I didn't start packing until 38 weeks when I started getting braxton hicks more frequently.  The sooner the better though because then you'll be less likely to forget important stuff. I would bring a bathrobe, comfy clothes (sweats, PJ's)  lot's of underwear, clothes for the drive home, something to do while in labor-magazines or a game, pillow, nursing bra if you want to nurse, flip flops, and for the baby all you really need are clothes, blanket, car seat and nail clippers or file to trim those really long nails.|`|BfBMRlNNaa	Now is as good a time as any to have everything packed and ready to go, that way you have one less thing to worry about! I remember I packed the usual, pajamas, underwear ( I got those boy shorts, super comfy after having the baby!) I also got the little travel size shower soaps and shampoos, etc. so I didn't have to worry about packing mine at the last minute. I also brought my own towel, hospital stays aren't my favorite, so I like to use as much of my own stuff as possible. And of course, a comfy outfit to wear home. In addition to that I brought a few movies to watch ( labor can go on for HOURS), my baby book and journal, camera and my cell phone and charger. For the baby I brought an outfit and blanket, everything else the hospital provided. It probably depends on the hospital, but I walked out of there with 2 diaper bags and a shopping bag full of baby supplies and samples! They were incredible! Best of luck to you and your new Baby!|`|mhvoPAOCaa	Yup..pack your stuff now, it could be at any moment.  My water broke 2 weeks before my due date...I had to pack my bag before I left for the 30 min drive to the hospital lol.<br>  <br>  You will want shampoo and conditioner, body wash<br>  deodorant<br>  babies bringing home outfit. <br>  I wish I would have brought myself more clothes<br>  underware<br>  Jammies|`|fwro8soqaa	I agree with everyone's lists.  One suggestion would be to make sure the panties you pack are what I like to call "period panties".  Those ugly ones you don't care if you bleed on and are as comfortable as hell.  You're going to be a little bit sore for a little while, and that's not the time to break out the victoria secrets!|`|5h8bYsKdaa	for you , shampoo, conditioner , soap , pads, a brush, lotion,  maternity clothes, some makeup if you wnt to make yourself look better<br>  <br>  bring some diapers, and clothes for the baby and all that stuff.<br>  <br>  i didnt like the hospital stuff|`|NDpO8hX4aa	u need to bring a comfy outfit for u to wear home and for baby ,carseat, baby blanket,
Fa130w6Gaa	If she has picked up the germs there isn't much you can do at this point other than trying to keep her immune system as healthy as possible so it can resist the germs. Keep breastfeeding her, try to make sure she is getting enough sleep, and keep her away from crowds where she could pick up more germs. Since you are still breastfeeding, she is getting some antibodies from you which will help keep her healthy too.<br>  PS- I love your daughter's name! My daughter is Madilynn Clara|`|S4soZUFCaa	It's too late to do anything now because your baby would have caught it by now if she did catch it. It spreads through sneezing and then inhaling the aerosol. Or by touching a contaminated surface and then putting your hand on your face (mucous membranes).<br>  But this prob. didn't happen last night, so she prob. didn't catch it. If she doesn't show symptoms by tonight or tomorrow, she's ok.
hQ8uCFqEaa	His second cousin... you'd be his aunt if one of your siblings or if you were married to someone whose siblings had kids, you'd be their aunt!|`|UpJbXh7Vaa	I always get confused on this...I think you are his second cousin. Either that, or first cousin once removed. I have a bunch of those because my dad is one of the youngest in his family and my aunts are a lot older than him. I actually have a 40 year old cousin, and her son is a few months older than me!|`|8oAlBL91aa	You're cousins.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Second cousin.|`|e663a3eea9acd94ea0c82d74d58bb3cbaa	His second cousin|`|cYRZpGkqaa	cousin|`|AA11784984	No I think he would be your 2nd cousin or 2nd cousin once removed.|`|28QPS6V9aa	You're his second cousin. You're only an aunt if your brother or sister had a kid.|`|XCX8w4LMaa	u would be his second cousin.<br>  hope this helps! =)

c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	First, quit having unprotected sex! Ever heard of pre-***? It can get you pregnant too, even before he ejaculates. <br>  Second, if you don't want to get pregnant, go get some birth-control, it costs less than $10 a month, which is way less expensive than a baby, so no excuses about it being too expensive. It can make you a little sick for the first few weeks, but that is nothing compared to being pregnant for 9 months. Oh, and that whole "you don't love me if you make me wear a condom" line is crap. Sex is privilege, if he won't respect your wishes, don't have sex with him. You do not "owe" it to him, and he certainly hasn't earned it.<br>  Third, this guy sounds like a jerk who you have just told us you can't trust. Why would you even want to risk becoming his "baby-mama"? So he can brag to all his friends that you were just so desperate to be with him that you went and had a BABY just to make him happy? I think he just wants you to have his kid so he has even more power over you. This is not the type of guy who makes a good father or husband. Since you can't even call him your boyfriend, I say you don't call him at all anymore. Ever.|`|p9xOzbr0aa	If you are not ready to have a kid with this guy (which I would say you sure as hell aren't especially if you guys aren't even in a committed relationship!) STOP HAVING SEX WITH HIM! If he's been trying to pull that kind of ****, who knows what he might do...poke a hole in a condom anyone?|`|jD8TxlLfaa	Stop having sex with him, and leave him. You have a right to do what is best for you.<br>  One of my exes once told me that he was going to throw my birth control pills away so he could get me pregnant...yeah. Didn't go over so well. Please note that I said "ex".|`|HCfVu9NNaa	wtf?  what an ***..break up with him or get on birth control and let him come all he wants!  jeeze..the nerve of some people.|`|HNovnyH7aa	and you are still sleeping w/ him, unprotected, why? If you don't know him well enough to have his kid, then you shouldn't engage in intercourse, let alone not use protection. This guy sounds like a creep and you sound gullible.|`|190ac0f8aa06b86ea25f6b4aac863fe4aa	UM!!!!! yeah, I would not do it with him anymore! It sounds like hes trying to trap you. He is not being very respectful to your wishes! Use a condom if you do decide to do it. I got pregnant from the pull out method! |`|cziG1hSxaa	A man who loves you would not do this to you. If you're not ready to be a parent, then you'd best stop sleeping with him.  It's only a matter of time.|`|ixzT5y1gaa	IF you do get pregnant, its as much your fault as it is his....you know what is happening and you are not trying to stop it.  how stupid|`|cV8meV3Zaa	That's crazy! Either cut him off or get YOURSELF on birth control.<br>  If you get pregnant it wouldn't be any ones fault but your own. Good Luck.|`|3874b9da5757db1e9738ada8bc0eac68aa	Why are you having sex with him then?  He isn't even your boyfriend.  Why aren't you using birth control and condoms?????|`|TvBGK1QLaa	Well if you don't use bc and he don't use a condom what do you think is going to happen? You are the female it's your body and at the end of the day it's your decision. You need to stand up for what you believe in and take control. If he don't like it, tell him to do it movin and kick rocks! Their are plenty other guys out their that would respect the fact that you are mature enough to wear a condom. But bc always made me sick to, I used the iud or the nuva ring. Theirs plenty of options for bc...Hope this helps, just keeping it real! ;)|`|xmVGViPiaa	Why are you having sex with him if you can't trust him?  Especially the pull out method, which will still get you pregnant even if he pulls out when he comes?<br>  It doesn't sound like you are that resistant to having a baby, either.<br>  <br>  Wait until you find someone you love.  In the mean time tell him that you don't want to have a baby right now, and stick to your guns.  It would be terrible to bring a baby into your life right now, especially with someone who you don't love in that way.<br>  I would also make him wear a condom and I would get on the birth control pill.  You have to control your own fertility, you cannot trust anyone else to protect you against pregnancy especially if he seems disrespectful in that dept.|`|TYjtVu2iaa	That would seriously creep me out.  I would either stop sleeping with him and/or break up with  him or get on birth control.  Anyone that doesn't respect your decisions isn't worth being with in my opinion.|`|atmDaT61aa	then stop having sex with him! That doesn't sound like the type of situation that you would want to bring a baby into.|`|vpL67nETaa	Why they hell aren't you using condoms?<br>  "He doesn't want to"?<br>  Then no sex for him. You aren't even in a relationship. What about STDs?<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are relying on the 'pull out method' it'd be a miracle if you DIDN'T get pregnant.<br>  <br>  If you can't agree on something like that, you shouldn't even be seeing eachother.<br>  <br>  <br>  I was never one for "flings," but if the guy I was casually seeing was trying to knock-me-up, I'd run for the hills.
zrBzRYI8aa	My doctor said only fried or or cooked calamari...YUMMY!|`|xmVGViPiaa	I personally would not eat it, 1) because it is cold and you did not cook it yourself and 2) because most seafood has a high mercury content which may be harmful to your baby.|`|34cb10175f924ff6c1a42da0a70d257eaa	Hey calamari is my favorite hehe!<br>  Yup theres absolutely nothing wrong eating calamari if ur preggy<br>  just dont eat too much as you may feel bloated|`|zTcHSR7baa	No its not. No cold seafood is safe.<br>  |`|vpL67nETaa	Yes, as long as it's cooked thoroughly.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's totally safe.
4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	Speech therapy with young children should be fun.  Your child should have fun and play with the therapist.  I'm a speech therapist and i work with toddlers and preschoolers.  I encourage you to look at ASHA's website (ASHA.org).  ASHA is the American Speech and Hearing Association.  They have a lot of information out there about what to expect, developmental norms, etc.<br>  <br>  When I do therapy, the first thing I do is establish a relationship with the child.  The child has to like and trust me.  i start this by following the child's lead and play with the toys the child seems interested in.  I use language and describe everything the child is doing and everything I'm doing.  Eventually i place demands on the child....either to show me something (through pointing, touching, holding up, etc) or telling me something (either a word, or a sign).  I use sign language with my students too.  <br>  <br>  Some common activities done in therapy are:  puzzles, games, crafts, bubbles, dolls, "house", playing farm, dress up, "cooking" (especially if the therapy is done in your home)....and by cooking, i mean mixing pudding, jello, something like that.<br>  <br>  Most children really enjoy therapy, especially at this age.  It's fun.  And it engages the child.  I also expect a parent to participate in therapy with me.....so the parent can learn my techniques to continue working on the goals in between therapy appointments.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wuZXqYPGaa	well i had speech therapy when i was 5 yrs old, cuz i couldnt stick words together properly and had trouble spitting things out. i think that its better that he is going to the speech therapy now so that he will get a fresh start on it. then he wont have more troubles once he hits school and stuff. Speech therapy involves many tests to see whut the trouble is with your 2 yr olds speaking, its not scary at all.. they usually just have you copy whut the lady is saying.. and understand how your child is translating things in his brain etc. <br>  2 sounds a bit young, but i guess its better to do it now :)<br>  but im glad i went into speech therapy-- took a while for me to click with words.. but i was young so dont even remember it. hope it goes well :)|`|3F8f1SoQaa	my son started speech therapy at 27 months old. The SLP has an office full of toys. When he first started going to therapy she worked on saying sounds correctly. As he progressed she used flash cards for certain sounds. They do flash cards for about 10-15 minutes, then play games for another 15-20 minutes. In playing the games they have the chance for learning all kinds of things. <br>  <br>  Thruthfully it is hard to tell you exactly what the therapist will do...What I can tell you is that my son LOVES going to therapy. He started out saying 10 words at 27 months old. By 30 months old he was speaking in short sentences. By 36 months old he was caught up with everything but articulation. He goes to special needs preschool now that he is 3, but has made TONS of progress.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Wit my son he was almost 1 1/12 when he started this (the doctor suggested it even though I felt he was fine) the teacher just showed him pictures in books and tried to get him to say what he saw. Or she has her bag of goodies with her and would slowly pronunciate each item as he took it and then asked him to say it back. Just simple things.
AA11160104	I'm sorry for your loss... but for the rest of it, don't do anything serious like moving in together unless you are 110% sure that's what you really want.  He does not sound like he's emotionally stable enough to make that kind of decision right now, so I would wait.  Good luck :)|`|xmVGViPiaa	I would keep talking to him.  He probably needs someone to be there to support him.  You can also tell him how you are feeling too.  A miscarriage can be hard to get over, but you just have to get it all out.<br>  <br>  After things heal up a little bit, that is when I would start to think about if the relationship is worth salvaging or not.  But I wouldn't do that during an emotional time like this because people can make decisions that they normally wouldn't when they are feeling like that.|`|DcffYZo5aa	whats the rush just tell him to relax u need ur space it has nothing to do with movin in with him ...it has to do with u emotionally , and u dont want to move in at a wims notice and then it not work out and have to move right back out ......i mean u werent even together at the time so u need to work on ur relationship b4 u move intogether|`|AA12141397	Go see a shrink! Irritability is a sign of depression and insulting others for no reasons justify the need for treatment with a professional AKA shrink.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	The best thing you can do right now is do nothing. <br>  <br>  A man doesn't show his commitment to you by having you move in with him when you haven't even defined the relationship and built a trusting, open relationship with effective communication. That is something that takes a long time to build. Something he should be doing with you before asking you to rush into moving in together. <br>  <br>  And pressuring you to have sex? What's that all about? You have told him your feelings about that? Just because you've already started being intimate with him and been pregnant and lost a child with him does NOT mean you have to continue to be intimate with him if you aren't ready or felt like you did it too soon before. <br>  <br>  If he loves you, he will stick around and be there for you until you are ready to take that step, period, end of discussion. |`|H74F8jxuaa	First of all you need to get away from him.  If he thinks that you are his little sex slave, then you need to find a guy that will treat you like a princess, and he surely isn't that guy.<br>  Secondly, I miscarried in Sept. and I know exactly how you feel.  It is a hard situation to go through, but you have to know and understand that it is really a blessing because there was something wrong with the baby's developments and your body realized it.  It is better to lose the baby before it is born than to give birth to a baby that will have health problems the rest of its life.  I know it sounds bad, but it is a good thing.  You should surround yourself with your family and loved ones, once you think you are ready to.  I only wanted to be around my husband and no one else, but I am really not that close to anyone else.  Try to relax and know that you didn't do anything wrong.  It didn't happen because you did something wrong and it isn't your fault...it was just meant to be.<br>

ygVTtSNVaa	I hope so so you dont get the job. Thats really sad. Quit doing drugs and THEN look for a job. You dont deserve the job if you do drugs. You'll just screw them over in the end.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Pregnancy will not show up.  But there is no way you'll be able to use a friend's urine.  They know all the tricks. |`|kbdkOPHDaa	lol well it depends on who does the test. sometimes jobs use the ones you can buy directly from wal mart, and those do not detect pregnancy. <br>  <br>  if you hafta go somewhere i think they can detect it but im not 100 percent sure.<br>  <br>  |`|TfSANCxKaa	please just stop doing drugs.  i know you've probably heard it a million times before, but it is way too easy to die when you are doing that stuff.  just think about how your friends and family would feel if you died.  please just stop.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	no pregnancy does not show up in a drug test cause they test for substances and pregnancy hormones is not a substance. goodluck on the interview|`|dcd1de17803a79e3f8899aed15210b60aa	No, pregnancy isn't something that is standardly checked on a drug test.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	Wow are you messed up.|`|9x9WPoNHaa	If they look for it, yes, it would show up. Unfortunately, they're not going to come out and tell you if they're testing you for pregnancy, they'd simply not hire you because it would be illegal to discriminate due to pregnancy.<br>  <br>  But if you aren't sober enough to pass a urine test, what makes you think you'll be able to hold on to the job very long? Usually companies have random drug tests on the job site to make sure what you're describing doesn't happen (people using other people's urine to get a job under false pretenses, which I believe in some way could be against the law--false identity and all). For your sake, I hope you can clean up your act, though, I wish you the best.|`|yPNvecc7aa	In high school my friend was worried because she had to do a blood test at the doctors and she was scared they would rat her out for smoking pot. She called a hot-line who advised her that if they weren't testing for drugs, they wouldn't see it.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing it would be the same for you. If they're not specifically looking for pregnancy, maybe they won't see it.<br>  <br>  However I find it weird and pointless to test for drugs if they let you bring your own urine... ??|`|Di7KqbVQaa	The exact same happened to my friend. She was a cannibis smoker, and I gave her...well... my pee. Unknown to me I was pregnant at the time lol. But what happened? She successfully gave the sample to the nurse without being caught, then they lost the test. In the end she had to do it herself and didnt get the job.<br>  <br>  Basically its karma lol.<br>  <br>  Look chick you're gonna go no where with your drug taking. Why are you even bothering.|`|jYPeis3Saa	ok, wow!!!<br>  speaking from someone who used to collect the urine samples of drug tests, there is no way in hell youll get away with using someone elses urine. i wont tell you how the will now itsn ot yours, but just know youll get caught. <br>  nice try though.<br>  <br>  and no they do not detect pregnany. they are not looking for it. they are looking for illegal drugs, not pregnancy hormones. <br>  |`|92e818bcae7097900ffbbb79e6f1f1b3aa	no, they're testing for drugs not pregnancy.  It's a totally different test|`|bl8vA1mpaa	No! it will not show they aren't looking for the HCG hormone...<br>  you shouldn't do that though<br>  and STOP DOING DRUGS!|`|XKvpZm3Jaa	get a life and quit the drugs|`|sGJhKesdaa	what kind of drug test are you taking where you can bring in urine?  i have done several drug test for companies and all i have done, they put you in a room and you are not allowed to have anything of your in there, they lock your belongings in a lock box and give you the key.  and they will not let you flush the toilet either.  one even checked my pockets.  and one even watched us pee. you had to sign the paper first that let you know they were going to do that. i have done probably 6 drug tests in all my years of working and yes i pass everyone, which is what you should try sometime.|`|yVhI1RBYaa	 I would say it depends, if it is a government job you are trying to get they test for all of that in the state in NM.I have heard of a male airman having his wife do the test for him and he lost everything b/c the test also showed he was preggers..lol.dumb ***..|`|fXBEuHmbaa	I am not sure, but I think they would have to test for it inorder for them to find it.  It depends if they test for that kind of thing.|`|I4xGGpQjaa	your a bad parent if you are pregnant, your child could come out too small and its possible it could die! Stop doing drugs you nasty druggie.|`|4wdVFlV6aa	no it wont show up it only shows up for THC and other drugs. dont worry you will do good :)|`|JGxhrCr1aa	You're pregnant?? Stop using drugs!

2iaIRqMlaa	To dammed busy then when we look back we regret what we have missed.  I worked most week  days until midnight one week then one week until two, that week was catch up on all the jobs that need doing.  No football or pubbing for me always working.  Now I wonder what I did do that was so important to miss my children's childhoods, there is more to life than work and money.  Maybe men cannot get the balance right?|`|dgRTkccBaa	I think many men are that way.  My husband doesn't spend much time with our kids though I'm hoping it's just because they're so young.  He will sit with them for a little while after dinner and play with them but that's about it.  He has never taken them out without me (they're 2 now) not even to the park and if I want him to come out on the weekend to take the kids to the park or the zoo I have to practically force him to go.  Most times I usually just take them out by myself just because I don't want to listen to him complain the whole time.|`|GE68lOBEaa	<br>  I do all the main work of feeding, bathing and chaning nappies etc. However my husband does spend an awful lot of time playing with our daughter. I have asked him on occasions to help me out but he never gets it right. He dressed the baby in a strange way, usually putting the baby in jeans and her pyjama top and then takes her out?? and he can never get her tights back on her? so i usually just do it myself and save a arguement-lol.
mx3gFmIKaa	I just went through it with my little sons ages 2 and 3.  My two year old it lasted 8 days.  The 3 yr old 5.  The medical websites say 3-9 days  I do think it lasts longer the younger you are.  DH and I got it 1-2 days<br>  <br>  We treated it at home, never went to the doctor or hospital.  I did call the doc like 3x.|`|MjashZnvaa	After my baby got his rotavirus vaccination he had diarraeh for at least 2 weeks. I dont know about if they just get it. Make sure you are keeping him well hydrated. Good luck!|`|6169fa372faf693494242ead618d4045aa	I've never heard of it lasting 3 weeks.  He should be better in a few more days.  Did he have any vomiting or anything?<br>  <br>  My son had vomiting for about 1.5 days and diarrhea for about a week.  He had it at 9 months old and wasn't vaccinated for it, if that helps any.  |`|079c5ce5e752fb22f0dcaeba08696398aa	ROTAVIRUS!!!! I hate that word but not near as much as I hate the virus! My daughter had it when she 3 years old and she was staying with my mom cause I had just gave birth and was in the hospital myself....my mom called me and told me that my little girl had green grass colored runny poop and was throwing up all the time I could hear her crying and yelling "I want my mommy" she had a VERY high fever and was sick 2 days and my mom took her back and they put her in the hospital and she was in there for almost 2 weeks...the whole time I had the nurses at the hospital and her doctor telling me that once I got out of the hospital that it was NOT a good idea to go see her since I had a newborn at home that I was breastfeeding cause it could be fatal to the baby if he was to get it! Very hard time....try going through the baby blues and losing a cousin to a drunk driver and having your baby girl put in the hospital all in the amount of 2 weeks! The hardest thing I have ever went through! Good luck to you though! I hope this helps.
aFiI2ABAaa	The white spots are fat. Just like cow's milk would separate if left in the refrigerator for awhile, so does breast milk. It's very normal, you may even have a layer of fat on the top, just shake it up once you've thawed it out to mix it all up.  |`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Like it seperated, like cottage cheesey, curdled.  The fat will do that - almost look chunky.|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	Yes it sometimes has little lumps there and when you defrost it you can see the fat on top. That's why you need to shake it before feeding it to your baby.
ZjxGBSeqaa	It might upset his stomach.  Protein is very hard to digest and his system might not be able to handle it too well.  It would be best to tell your mother so she knows.|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	My two month old can barely muster the ability to swallow a whole lot of milk at one time, so I too call BS.<br>  <br>  The only way meat could successfully go down his throat is if you were ramming it down there.|`|fDbNb6h1aa	how did the baby even eat the meat with no teeth?  |`|ac5gX7sNaa	Tell your mother that you did this. You should have never given this to him, it can make him sick. If you were left responsible for him you should have known not to give him anything but formula or breast milk. <br>  <br>  He cannot digest this, and you say you gave him a lot. Tell your mother. He will probably have a very sore stomatch. |`|zQAWuMN4aa	How in God's name did he not CHOKE on it? No, it's NOT ok that you did that. You need to tell your mother right away. Call her. Call a relative and say what you did. They should be able to help you.|`|AA10137294	I call BS. A two month old doesn't yet have the reflexes to swallow chunks of food. His tongue would push it out of his mouth.|`|xmVGViPiaa	How did a 2 month old eat the meat?  They don't even have any teeth....|`|OtOU1zTSaa	how did a 2 month old eat meat without choking and why were you left with a 2 month old when you didnt even know better then to give him that...how old are you anyway. Your Mother should be ashamed of herself.|`|EXaXuakBaa	you tard! <br>  tell your mom!
ubkt5RQiaa	It is the strep test.  I don't know much about it, but they will have to give you antibiotics during labor so it doesn't pass to the baby.  It does go away though I believe, nothing to really worry much about.|`|T48smu01aa	why didn't you ask the doctor?|`|bIvsLrCUaa	Wipe around the skin of the vagina?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Thats sounds awfully disgusting.|`|uSsmriwWaa	That's a Group B strep test. Nothing to worry about. 30% of all pregnant woman are positive. Your baby could catch it at birth from the bacteria in your vagina and rectum. They'll give you antibiotics when you're in labor so the baby won't catch it. It's harmless for an adult but serious for a baby. You'll be fine with the antibiotics. I know women who were positive and had no problems. You and your baby will be fine! Now that you know what it is, you can google it. It's also called GBS. Best of luck.|`|ipnhJsP0aa	It was the Strep B test. It can be passed on to the baby through the vaginal walls on the way out, so that is why you are on antibiotics, to get it under control.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Everyone has this test done and about 50% come out positive....<br>  Nothing too worry about too much...|`|pA1eomsvaa	That's a Group B strep test. Nothing to worry about.  Your baby could catch it at birth from the bacteria in your vagina and rectum. They'll give you antibiotics when you're in labor so the baby won't catch it. It's harmless for an adult but serious for a baby.  You and your baby will be fine! |`|xmVGViPiaa	It's strep B.  Many women have it and it isn't harmful to you, but it can spread to your baby and may be harmful to your baby during the birth process, so they will give you antibiotics during labor so that it does not spread to him/her.|`|Pin3irH2aa	You were tested for group b strep..a bacterial infection which is harmless to u but can be passed to ur baby while delivering..same here..|`|zQ2m2rkXaa	Group Strep B. It's just a virus. They will give you the antibiotics in delivery.

I just feel plain yucky.  However, just because I don't have those pain doesn't mean it isn't normal, but I'd still call your dr. so they can ease your mind.|`|AA11731115	I'm eight weeks and I've been crampy from week five. It's normal to have some pains - I expect that however your normally get your period cramps would be around the same area's you'll feel discomfort with early pregnancy. Implantation causes pain in some women.<br>  Basically it's just the beginning of a loooong journey of various aches, pains, cramps, headaches, heartburn and general -pregnancy.<br>  <br>  But as they say, if you're concerned, ask your OB. They're used to worried pregnant ladies..it's their job!|`|xmVGViPiaa	You should call your doctor.  Pain in the abdomen is normal and aches throughout your body including your back are also normal but they should not be severe.|`|CJaVuY4Uaa	you should call your doctor right away.When i was seven weeks pregnant,i had lower stomach pain and back pain but it wasnt severe.|`|go2qKKf2aa	Anytime you feel pain or have concerns, go the the doctor.  Many nurses and even physicians will tell you to relax and it's normal, especially with a first pregnancy.  However, better to be precautious and have the doctor see you.|`|zX5j4U9kaa	Sounds like gas, let it pass.
91x3trOnaa	You could be.  Your peak fertility was probably around the 27th, but sperm can live inside you up to 5 days, so you were possibly in a fertile window (it really depends on when you ovulate).  Take a test, in a few days and you'll know for sure!|`|horefBCyaa	it's possible. but it could also be PMS. so i would wait to see if your AF shows up. and if it doesn't test like a week late and see what it says. good luck!|`|CsjR9Vwsaa	You could very well be pregnant. I would wait until your period is late and then test. Because it took 3 1/2 weeks to show up for me|`|xmVGViPiaa	Take a test.  There is no other way to determine if you are pregnant as pregnancy shares many symptoms with PMS and other conditions.  Being emotional could be many things, pregnancy is one of them but not the only one.  You could be stressed out, fatigued, ill, PMS-ing, etc etc etc.|`|i5p5lw31aa	well it could be that, or pms. wait to see if you miss your period. if you do, take a hpt 2 weeks later and see if you are. your hcg levels will be too low to show up on a test before then. if your hpt shows up positive go to your doctor to get blood drawn to confirm. g'luck and i hope you get preggers!! :)|`|jZZg6vmnaa	ever since october 31, i've been very aggravated and crying over almost anything. and i flip out on my boyfriend over EVERYTHING. i hate it. good luck [:|`|5bweP3vlaa	Sounds promising sweetie I pray you get that BFP !!!!!!!!!!!!! BABY DUST 
L8peUnIPaa	Its because your blood volume has increased to maintain the fetus & it becomes harder for your heart ot pump it, your lungs ot oxygenate t & then get it to your body & baby too.<br>  OB/GYN RN & mom|`|xmVGViPiaa	I would call your doctor about the high blood pressure.  Being excited should not elevate your blood pressure that much and I am surprised they weren't a bit concerned with it.  I would call the doctor and tell them you are experiencing shortness of breath and you are concerned because of your blood pressure at your last appointment.<br>  <br>  Additionally some shortness of breath is normal early in pregnancy.  Your body has increased it's blood volume by 40% so your lungs are having to work harder to supply oxygen and your heart is having to work harder to pump all of that blood.  The added strain to your body may cause shortness of breath.  I had it very mildly in the beginning but it would always go away when I laid down.|`|a9Z4pGXGaa	Oh Honey...you think you are out of breath now...just wait until your 7 months...walking to your car from the grocery store will feel like a workout. (I know how you feel, before I got pregnant I used to be able to run 3 miles a day...now, just pushing myself off the couch feels like too much weight on my legs)<br>  <br>  Never had the hypertension..if this is your first, I could see where you might be a little paranoid about every little thing...I know I was. I was constantly freaking out.|`|AA10715129	I'm 21 wks and I am starting to get out of breath. It may also depend on your height.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	You have a virus. I've been dealing with this too. Try and eat only toast, soup and water. |`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Norovirus.  And it the smoothie, had any kind of milk product - yogurt, milk, ice cream, etc, that makes it worse.|`|2ktp7dEUaa	You're probably just getting the flu or another virus. Just relax and take it easy and go to the doctor in a couple days if you still can't keep anything down. Hope you feel better! =]|`|EccBqsntaa	1. You're pregnant<br>  2. You have a virus. <br>  3.

Eventually try eating something like Jello or crackers and see if you can keep them down.  You may just have a stomach bug.  It's good you can keep fluids down at least, you won't get dehydrated.<br>  If it doesn't get better within 24-48 hours then definitely call your doctor.  I hope that if you got cut up badly on your leg you have seen a doctor already and may be on medication (medications can make you throw up too).|`|TcaWW4OBaa	go to the doctors, you may need a tetnus booster from taht cut and that might be causing it.<br>  <br>  although i dont really know if tetnus makes you vomit. if not you could have a bug or something. but still, see a doctor. and anyway, youll need extra nutrients and gastrolites to replace what you keep throwing up. they come in iceblock, so im prety sure you could keep them down.<br>  <br>  get better soon xx|`|r1zPvRdPaa	infection. or something is going on wih your digestive system. you need to get a doc to check it out, it could be life threatening. most of these problems are fixed with simple medication or a lifestyle change, but some could be more serious. check it out before it gets worse...|`|u2USmGcMaa	Well at least you try to eat so your not anorexic.

4ead5dde649b8ca448598942dc4779b4aa	if the condom didnt break and she's on b.c. she should be fine. |`|yKcZC9Dhaa	I'm 16, me and my boyfriend also had this exact problem. My period was about 3 days late, I freaked out of course. But it came. I was also on birth control and we used a condom. Don't worry, you took the precautions. Just wait, and stress can delay a period as well. So just calm down, and calm her down especially. If you're seriously worried, buy a home pregnancy test. And see a doctor. Just calm down.|`|mVeI5Ixeaa	Ease your mind and buy a pregnancy test.  Its ten dollars well spent.|`|xmVGViPiaa	If you used a condom and she is on birth control then I highly doubt she is pregnant.  It sounds like it is just stress to me.  Worrying can cause a woman's period to delay - so can stress.  If she stops stressing out over the possibility of being pregnant I would bet you 99% that her period will come within a few days.|`|AA11110785	Being two days late is no big deal.  Wait until she is 7 days late to worry.  Once she is 7 days late then she can take a home pregnancy test but odds are since you used a condom that she isn't pregnant.  <br>  If she is stressed at all, that can delay her period also.  |`|qImMwhUHaa	I commend you on using birth control but if you aren't ready for children then you shouldn't put yourself in a position to have them. I was also in the same situation as you and my first time I was late and thought that I might be pregnant. If the girl is on bc and you used a condom then the chances are very slim but the only sure way to not get pregnant is abstinence...but you already knew that though. Sex is sacred. When you get married your wife won't appreciate that you've "made love" with other girls.|`|NlsRjx8Haa	I am guessing that the stress of the whole situation is delaying her period.  If you used a condom and she has been on birth control for over a year, I think your chances of NOT being pregnant are pretty good.  Sounds like to me that you are a very caring person and you dont need the "you should wait" lecture - you just gave it to yourself.  Hang in there - i bet everything is ok.  |`|a026394b1571d2c430767a9dde2844deaa	Being on birth control and using a condom I would say the chances are slim, Are you sure he calculated her period right maybe shes really not 2 days late? It could also be stress that is delaying her period. If she has indeed missed her period then if she is pregnant a pos will show on the test at this point. Maybe have her take a test. That will be the only way to know for sure. |`|DPNEjvd2aa	Her period could be late for absolutely any reason. Wait until it's been about 1 month and take a test. Within the first month of becoming pregnant, most women experience morning sickness. I wouldn't worry if it's less than a week. Good luck.|`|R8qC6DVuaa	it's probably nothing. she might just be stressed out. i had a friend who thought she was pregnant and didn't have her period for almost 3 months.. the doctor said she was just stressed out. |`|zH80yyDQaa	Her period is just a little late.  Chill.  Wait a few more days until you worry.
jG8b3Mz0aa	Yes, although I wouldn't say as a symptom. It's just my boobies have grown larger and everything is a bit more defined & noticable. (:|`|xPfJG3FGaa	yes my breasts look like road maps|`|xmVGViPiaa	Yes.  When I became pregnant the veins in my breasts became larger and more visible.  Also the veins in my abdomen did as well.  Your blood supply increases when you become pregnant so your veins will look larger and in some cases, be more visible.|`|whkC5077aa	Yes, it looked like the tube route map, the green vein and the red all visible clearly.|`|14cb86742bef47bb0642cef64fb316adaa	Yes :)<br>  My body is starting to look like a road map.<br>  Im 11 weeks now and this whole time ive been getting more visible veins on my breasts, abdomen, arms, legs, hips and feet |`|1o820L3Daa	Yeah my boobs are like maps.lol..and Im getting little vein popping in out on my tummy.|`|ppafedlgaa	Oh yea. My boobs look like a road map. There's so much extra blood flow when you are pregnant that you have lots more visible veins. |`|M5b6qmwKaa	YEAAH|`|vjK8ZT20aa	yeah there is an increased blood flow hence the blue veins.|`|YJ4Ef99eaa	they said that could happen in parenting
JPrUz4LJaa	The only thing you can really do is stay supportive! Your right she does need to see a doctor but more than anything she needs to tell her parents! You can only advise her on what you would do but you can't make her do anything she doesn't want to! Good luck|`|1IDSGM71aa	It isn't your responsibility to do anything. If she was mature enough to have sex, she needs to be mature enough to take responsibility for this pregnancy and the unborn child and tell her parents so she can start seeing a doctor or midwife. All youcan really do is keep trying to talk to her. It isn't up to you to tell her parents. She needs to grow up and start taking care of herself and the baby, especially since you say she wants to keep it.|`|eemmWU0Haa	well first off you don't do nothing its not you pregnant its her even tho she's your best friend and all, but she does have to tell her parents for sure cos she does need to see a doctor and soon!, good luck to you and the friend!|`|xmVGViPiaa	Just keep urging her to tell her parents.  Offer to be there with her or nearby if she wants you to.  It will be hard for her but you can help her through it by being a good support for her.  Maybe you should call her sometime when her boyfriend/baby's father is not around and talk to her about it one on one... Or plan a lunch out on the weekend when he is not around and talk to her.  It will really help her esteem if she knows someone is there to take care of her and to love her, outside of family.  |`|ppafedlgaa	Well if she can't talk to her parents just yet, maybe your mom can be her savior. Tell her to talk to your mom about it and maybe she can help talk to her with you. Just give her lots of support and make sure she is taking care of herself. Tell her she needs to tell someone soon because prenatatl care is so important, and if she wants this baby, she needs to take good care of it. |`|l6qpYtMzaa	the only thing that you can do is try to get her to tell her parents sweetie..just tell her its important for her to for the sake of her baby and her.  good luck!|`|8nQaIcq9aa	At 14 she has to tell her parents and they can MAKE her get an abortion if thats what they want, She cannot make a decision to keep a pregnancy until the legal age for sexual concent. <br>  <br>  I have been through this a few times when i was at school and my 14,15,16yr old friends would get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Even if she doesn't tell her parents until it is too late to get an abortion they can still make her adopt the baby out.<br>  <br>  So my advise would be to tell her to tell her parents and if she won't, get your mum to or you do it. <br>  <br>  Because at the moment she thinks she's pregnant she thinks she has earned the right to make adult decisions and she's very very wrong.<br>  <br>  If she really wants to keep the baby she needs to talk to her parents and express to them how much she wants to keep it. Telling them will help them to see that she is going about it in a mature way.
dy34Qyugaa	too early and yes you could be pregnant.<br>  |`|VfmwKkGwaa	Yes, it's to early to take an HPT.  Most don't register until at least 5 days before your missed period, and I would venture to say that's even pushing it.  You could be pregnant, but it would be a little early to be experiencing symptoms.  Achiness, can also be attributed to other things, not just pregnancy.  If you're unsure about the HPT, read the information that comes with it to learn about the particular brand you are using.|`|0xQYwNpcaa	yea, its too early for the pregnancy test to read ur HCG levels. <br>  u could possibly be pregnant. everytime u have unprotected sex, ur riskin gettin pregnant. even if u use protection, u could still get pregnant. i'm 5weeks&i gots pregnant by the condom breakin.<br>  if ur feelin **nausea, ur throwin up, lower back aches, cramps[similar to period cramps&ur boobs are tender&sore, then that could indicate that u are pregnant. u can only wait until u've missed ur period. if so, take a home pregnancy test maybe...a weeks after. it'll give ur HCG levels enough time to get up there.<br>  <br>  *good luck sweetie|`|l5iL1p8Yaa	If your period is due on Nov 28th, then you would probably not even have ovulated yet. You can't get pregnant unless you have unprotected sex right before or during your time of ovulation. Some women do get achey feelings around the time they ovulate (cramps, fatigue, bloating) so that may be what you are feeling. If you are trying to get pregnant now would be around the right time to have sex. If not, then please abstain or you will find yourself with an unwanted pregnancy. Good luck!|`|AtVRWrwCaa	You definitely could be pregnant. Unprotected sex is not aa good idea unless you are trying to get pregnant. So please IF you are not trying and IF you are not pregnant- please be more careful in the future.<br>  <br>  Most hpts can be taken only 5 days before your missed period and it is now too early to tell. Take another one around Nov. 24th first thing in the morning. It seems to work better if you take it in the morning with your first pee. (Gross but true! lol)<br>  <br>  Best of luck! Feel free to email me if you need to talk or if you have any more questions. :)|`|xmVGViPiaa	Yes, it is too early and you could be pregnant.  Wait until 4 days before your period is expected (Nov 24) and then take another test.  |`|hkfcjKXOaa	could be 
Qm4BKE13aa	First stay in school, don't give her any money until the baby is born and you get a paternity test. If you didn't enter her odds are it isn't your baby. Don't screw your life up by quitting school and stuff until you know thats your baby. |`|S545jx81aa	Yeah im wondering how you could have got her pregnant with out having sex?????? Ummm i would not advise an abortion. Please dont kill that baby. Stay with her and when the baby is born demand a paternity test. If your semen didn't go into her she couldn't have gotten pregnant by you....If it is yours, well guess what bud. You chose to fool around and consequences come from those actions. Its your responsibility to take care of that baby and help her. You can still have fun but its going to be less. and if it is yours well im really curious how you got her pregnant. :S|`|kuvwYBGMaa	If you still wanted to have fun you should have used protection. And it sounds like maybe she had sex with someone else because there is no way anywhere that you can get pregnant without having sex. I would talk to her about this. It is physically impossible unless she had in vitro, which I don't think she did. Sounds like you aren't the daddy.|`|7d0d302bef52f1187580c3d6f022e46aaa	Well, that's what you get for fooling around without realizing the consequences. Don't leave her behind. Stay with her through out the pregnancy. Once the baby is born she can give it up for adoption.|`|JUXAK0euaa	Stay in school and get a part time job. Also once the baby is born get a paternity test.|`|pqqDS4sfaa	may i just ask how you got her pregnant if you didnt have sex?? i hate to state the OBVIOUS|`|p2OUNHjyaa	Stay in school and raise the baby, yes it will be hard because you are still kids yourself. Tell your parents and hopefully they will support your decision to keep the baby. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Withdrawal or where the man pulls his penis out before he comes or ejaculates is NOT a reliable form of contraception. Sperm is often present on the tip of the penis even before he comes - if you are fertile and engaging in this form of intercourse you are running a very serious risk of getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  No you can't , However there is a remote chance of getting pregnant if the penis or sperm comes in contact with the mouth of your vagina when you are fertile, that is, in the presence of your wet, slippery mucus. To be on the safe side, whenever you are fertile keep the penis well away from your vagina.<br>  <br>  Another important thing to remember is that sperm can live for up to 5 days, so knowing your body and its fertility and allowing a number of safe days (generally about 5 days) leading up to and after (2-3 days) ovulation / fertile times is essential. |`|AA11727779	Give the baby up for adoption. to someone who really wants a baby and can take good care of it and stop having sex. you are a child. ok.you say you did not have sex with her. well than you are not the daddy. do what the first girl said. take a DNA test, but still if you did not have sex..you can not be the dad.|`|DneneGsxaa	lmao ha ha ha ha ha um you can't get someone pregnant without having sex, wow thought you would have sex-ed by now, but every school is different. you need to e-mail me  n1nja007@yahoo.com.. i can teach you all about the birds and the bees so what i am saying, is if she is pregnant and you haven't had sex.. um it's not yours and she had to have slept with someone.. wow. lol i don't mean to laugh, but seriously that is not possible, i hope this helps you..... it's not physically possible unless you took your semen and injected it into her lol. hope this helps ya A LOT. <br>  you also should talk to your parents about sex and explain to them you didnt' have sex iwth her, yet she is pregnant, they would be so delighted to hear you didn't ahve sex lol :)|`|DUxXb722aa	Ok.. listen up.. this is what you should do.. GO FIND A HEAVY TRAFFIC AREA AND RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN LIKE  FOREST DID IN THAT ONE MOVIE. SCREAM AS LOUD AS YOU CAN SAYING "RUN FOREST RUN"  THEN  it will be over. You are eaither a troll looking for something to do or you missed the short bus this morning.  I had fun typing this. thanks for the laugh.|`|44QPXU5eaa	Are you sure it is even your child? How can you get a girl pregnant without having sex is what i would like to know. Stay in school and get an education.|`|S4HUVnzkaa	If you didn't have sex with her, she has another boyfriend.<br>  A simple blood test will tell if it is yours or not.<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard the name Trojan?<br>  When you get old enough use them.|`|27LTTIC2aa	I highly doubt that you got the girl pregnant without doing anything. Did u ever ejaculate near any body part? Maybe shes telling u that ur the dad to get support. |`|iIlJF7xXaa	Well, if you didn't have sex, I would sure get a paternity test at the appropriate time. I|`|WDtYCEBxaa	you need to talk to your parents about that one because to get someone pregnant you have to have sex. it sounds to me that this young lady may have had sex with someone else and now she wants to say it's yours or either your not telling the truth. really you should talk to mom or dad  with the girl and her parents. Good luck|`|VU3d7MTEaa	i don't think you will have a baby without really having sex with a girl, that's a stupid thin to say. i would just recommend that you face this both together and don't left her wondering what to. face the fact that you'll both have a baby and live together if allowed by both of your parents so that you could take good care of your soon to be child. please don't play around. having a child is not a game that you can quit on to. face it and be  a man!|`|16389c850f4a84b750639ad85af8acdfaa	When fulling around and you cumming in your pants it can go threw and that could be how she ended up getting pregnant. Have you ever heard of the actress Suzann Summers well anyways that is how she got pregnant her first time. |`|zPcP4w1Vaa	This question has to be fake. But if it's not and you are really that stupid, YOU CAN'T GET SOMEONE PREGNANT IF YOU DON'T HAVE SEX. Unless it's Jesus, it ain't gonna happen. If your girlfriend is pregnant%2|`|PbCyFObzaa	wow nick. you actually did this, youre freaking lame. and yeah, like i would actually cheat. smarttt.|`|0AnsztdOaa	You didn't get her preggers if you never had sex. She's having sex w/ someone else.|`|NxoECzHcaa	don't drop out.<br>  just get a job.and don't leave her<br>  |`|Hvuqv6duaa	Name the baby Jesus and wish for better days, Joe.|`|K7AEM5sGaa	wow! that is impossible. and to think they dont want to teach sex ed in some schools|`|tDLpS828aa	you cant get her pregnant w/o havin sex; she cheated
YdCKzBAYaa	I'm glad I'm not the only one!!!  <br>  <br>  Okay, I recently went through what you're going through.  I too had unprotected sex right before I went on Yaz, and we used the pullout method.  My GYN did make me take a pregnancy test before I got it, but it was only 3 days after sex so it came back negative.<br>  <br>  I got my period the day after my doctor's appointment (October 29) and started Yaz on Sunday the 2nd of November.  I have been getting some major side effects.  Nausea in the morning, cramping in my abdomen, and lower back, headaches, cravings, light-headedness, sore breasts... you name a pregnancy symptom that Yaz birth control can create and I got it! <br>  <br>  I posted numerous questions about it on here, and I finally decided that it has to be the birth control because other people have gotten those effects too! <br>  <br>  I'm not 100% positive that I'm not pregnant, just mainly because my period isn't supposed to be for another 1 1/2 weeks, but I can tell you that I've had the same symptoms.|`|yKcZC9Dhaa	i never had side effects from yaz. but everyones different. i suggest taking a pregnancy test and seeing your doctor|`|P37lIBr2aa	All Birth control will have side effects similar to pregnancy. I didn't do well on Yaz either as it made me sick (though I never threw up) & gave me crazy mood swings. I would take a test just to reassure yourself & talk to your doctor about your symptoms. He possibly can suggest something that will work better with your body.|`|xmVGViPiaa	I would say it's probably due to the YAZ pill.<br>  <br>  Next week I would definitely take a pregnancy test to make sure, but it sounds like it's more likely the effect of the pill since it's happened so drastically and right after you took a dose.  When I developed morning sickness it was more of a gradual thing - I felt sick for days before the throwing up actually started, not all my symptoms came at the same time.
GDClFCdNaa	I know its hard at first but dont worry. First before the feeding try pumping a litte bit of milk so your not so engorged, then makesure she is latching on correctly, getting alot of the areola in her mouth. If you can have your hubby massage your breast while you feed her, Ive read it really helps!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	she's a snacker and it's normal- hand express some out so teyy feel better- my son was the same way- it gets much better|`|C0GeEv7kaa	If your breasts are still engorged after feedings then the best thing to do is pump out the excess milk so that way fresh milk can come in and you're not in so much pain. After doing that, you should take a nice relaxing warm shower and gently massage your breasts to help relieve your pain. |`|AA10529334	Next time she cries and you feel the "let down" use a breast pump and pump a bunch out. You can freeze it if you want to for future use. Use the pump on both sides for a few minutes until they feel better. If you dont have a breast pump get in the shower and let warm water run over the breasts until they start to leak ( should not take long) and let it drip in the shower until you feel better. I could make mine spray even I had soo much more milk than the baby needed at first.|`|egSK30E4aa	I'm sure she's getting enough...in little snacks.  My son did this, wanted to eat a little, then 20 minutes a little more.  I had to start making him wait a little longer each time until we established a regular pattern.  Try to distract her in some way, attempting to make her wait until she's really hungry.  She could be using you as a human pacifier...I've been there too!|`|AA10949869	To relieve your pain, you can use a breast pump to pump out some of that milk. As for your baby eating enough, you might want to ask her pediatrician...|`|ECpg4U4Paa	Your daughter may not be latching on correctly.  Which means she is not getting the milk she needs and your boobs are going to hurt. There are breastfeeding classes you can take. Or I'm sure you could look online and find some topics on how to get a baby to latch on right and comforting for the both of you.|`|BgKafc0caa	Is she latching on correctly. My daughter and I had a few latching problems until we found the nursing position that worked best for her.|`|BmtKkjjXaa	You need to make an appt to see a lactation nurse ASAP. It sounds like she is not getting latched on well. What you may want to do for know is to pump till you can talk to the lactation nurse. Get some warm packs for the swelling. You could also try different positions of holding your daughter. Also, apply Lasinoh after each pumping/ breast-feeding session. You can also google breast-feeding tips to help you out, though I strongly advise finding a lactation nurse first thing tomorrow. Look for a local consultant through either La Leche Leaque or in your local yellow pages.|`|N10hRAfFaa	I don't have enough info to tell you if this is the case but you may have overactive let down.. this happened to me. My second was anightmare.. she was growign and getting enough milk, but as soon as I got letdown she just couldn't handle it.  She'd suck then not latch back on when I let down.  Then she'd be hungry again and it was a cycle.  I agree try to see a lc she should be able to help.  <br>  <br>  if you think it's overactive letdown or a oversupply of milk DO NOT PUMP!  people tried to tell me this and it actually makes things worse :(  I know the pain and frustration. I am so sorry!  Get some warm compresses or cabbage leaves.  (because pumping will cause you to have more supply and you'll continue to be engorged) <br>  <br>  also i think with each child you produce more milk.|`|jNtkhOTVaa	Aw, don't panic.  My breasts were engorged when my milk came in too but it only lasted about 24 hours.  Feed her every time shes hungry.  She knows when to eat.  And don't panic.  Tomorrow you should have a decent flow going.  <br>  <br>  In the mean time take a hot shower or get some warm compresses for your breasts.  That will help.  Also, a pump will do wonders if you're really worried.  Pump it out, put it in a bottle and you'll see how much she is getting.  Just don't make a habit of it.  There can be confusion between breasts and bottles for babies.  But it does put your mind at ease.  I was constantly worrying that my son wasn't getting enough to eat.  <br>  <br>  Look for signs of dehydration.  And if it helps then talk to a breast consultant or ask your doctor about it.  It will be okay.  :)  This sounds very normal.  It sounds like its just your milk coming in.  She doesn't have to eat a lot at a time if she keeps coming back for more after only a little bit of time.
9aee17f1b8f2b3ee6fec5cf48726cac8aa	Nopers, you need to drink more fluids!|`|eemmWU0Haa	LOL. I don't think so...if it is then I ve been pregnant many many times b4!~|`|OT8b8z4Vaa	There could be tons of little signs for pregnancy but the most reliable is an actual positive pregnancy test. If you are unsure and want to know, a simple blood test at your Doctor's office can give you a definite answer. <br>  <br>  Also, signs for cloudy urine could also indicate an infection, such as a bladder infection. If your symptoms worsen, you should definitely make an appointment with your physician. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you & take care! |`|xmVGViPiaa	It's a sign of dehydration, not pregnancy.  Drink some more water.|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	no... but you might have too much bacteria in your pee, or maybe an infection. |`|4AljTfVnaa	No, but it is a sign of an infection...|`|91x3trOnaa	No. 
UXRwYHrMaa	Yes of course stress and wild changes in diet or exercise could make your period late or skipped all together.<br>  <br>  But the more important question is: have you been having unprotected sex? Did you miss BC pills or have a condom break that you have a reason to suspect you might be pregnant.<br>  <br>  It sounds on balance like your life right now is the cause of the missed period, not a pregnancy. But if you have been having unprotected sex there is always a chance you could be pregnant. To give yourself peace of mind, buy a simple pee test at the pharmacist. It really isn't as scary as it seems like it will be.|`|xmVGViPiaa	Eating the fast food probably isn't contributing to your problem BUT if you aren't eating well it can delay your period.  Also stress is a likely cause of your period being delayed -- stress can mess with your body.<br>  <br>  I would take a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy and try to relax and clear your mind.|`|q8nkzBspaa	that could happen, you are putting your body under a lot of stress. you should take a hpt to be sure. Try to handle your stress better and work on your eating habits. If your not pregnant do it for you. If you are pregnant do it for your baby, he/she depends on you to provide a save shelter for 9 months.|`|12e623ece8e2076f52ee7aa40b058322aa	It's probably from the stress but just to be on the safe side I think you should take a test

However, you may be temporarily low on iron (anemic) and that is a frequent case of fatigue during pregnancy. Aside from iron supplements, good sources of iron are read meat, spinach and beans. So try to get more of those and see if you feel any different. |`|eFLnKTNBaa	It never did. But it got better at the second trimester.

AA11143689	Congratulations on your pregnancy.  I think the throat spray would be safe - worth giving a try.  Usually herbal or chloroseptic is not so strong like an antibiotic would be.  Sometimes just rest will help the sore throat - if virus origin - go away.  Also, I have found that elderberry - zinc lozenges are good to get rid of virus stuff - even if they are sweet.  Also, xylitol sweetener helps rid bacterias!  Go easy, but I would do spray - like an herbal one.  Ziacam also helps rid sinus complications.  It's basically zinc.  Zinc is good for you I think.  You can check with your doctor, but I think natural stuff is good.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	You can use throat  lozenges. But if your throat looks that swollen you might want to consider seeing a doctor in case its something a  little more serious....good luck. |`|EvlPzrVOaa	im a guy but last week i almost got real sick and i used that emergen c product. it has about 2000 ml of vitamin c. i used it once a day and it helped a great deal without taking other things with it. |`|ZVeGEdfUaa	l would call the doctor and see if you can get an appointment soon, but other than that, l used Hall's FruitBreezers for my sore throats. lt's made of mostly fruit pectic, and has no menthol so you can have as many as you like.

If it does not go down within 24 hours you should see a Dr.  Also make sure you are not running a fever, if you are take Tylenol and drink a lot of cold fluids to keep your temperature down.|`|Wkf0YTKtaa	Gargle salt water.  If that doesnt do it, see your doctor.  Do not take any medicine before speaking to your doctor.  They usually dont want you taking anything until after 13 weeks.|`|YibFfKs0aa	I would talk to your doctor. If you already have a prenatal doctor, then definitely talk to him/her.
xmVGViPiaa	I had a crib set up by the time I was 20 weeks along, BUT I did not really buy much else for the baby until my baby shower at 28 weeks.  I got almost everything I needed for my shower so I am glad I did not go out buying tons of stuff... and since I had my shower at 28 weeks I have had well over 10 weeks to buy everything else I need that I didn't get.|`|5fk4Ajzjaa	At this point in time you may want to start putting together a registry at whatever store you choose.  When people ask you what you need you can just point them out to the registry.  Have items that cost different amounts so that people can spend what they'd like.  <br>  <br>  From my personal experience, I waited until I was 8 months pregnant to put up a crib and even with my husbands help it was really hard to get around.  I'd definately suggest doing it before that, or just not help putting it up.  <br>  <br>  There are lots of expensive things that come with having a baby.  If you're getting anxious to get the basics like a crib and cribbing then I'd suggest just getting it yourself.  If you have family and friends that want to spend a lot of money on a gift there are things they could get for you.  Things like a car seat, stroller, swing, bouncer, etc. can get quite costly too.  <br>  <br>  If I may suggest something, get neutral colors if you think this may not be the only baby in your future.  You get one first child and those are (usually) the only ones where you get a baby shower, so be smart with what you ask for.  Dont go all pink or all blue!   Good luck with your pregnacy!|`|AA11301623	After the first trimester was over, we started buying things little by little ( we went with as much used and hand me downs as possible). Even with the baby shower, there are still A LOT of baby items you'll have to get and it can get expensive. So I recommend getting a little by little as the months go by. We started a baby registry around 5 months and people have been buying us things...we've got only a few weeks to go and have everything we need for baby. :)<br>  <br>   Worked for us but then we are stationed overseas so its a little different. <br>  <br>  Hope it helps and congrats!|`|MtC3CWZraa	I’m 27 weeks. We’ve gotten as far as clearing out our former catch-all room, buying the crib bedding and picking paint colors. We have a chest of drawers and rocking chair and know his parents will buy the crb when we let them know we’re ready for it. <br>  <br>  My husband will be painting sometime between Thanksgiving & Christmas (so between my 28th & 32nd weeks) and we’ll probably get most of it set up over the holidays. <br>  <br>  I’m not that concerned about the nursery being done though. I’ll be breastfeeding so she’ll be in our room for a couple of months anyway. It’s not like she’ll know if her room isn’t exactly done when she gets here. <br>  |`|v3LnJycKaa	Um I picked out paint colors and bought the paint all that sort of stuff very early on... incase i didnt like it.. but i wouldnt get the crib or anything until after the shower bacuse you never know what you are goingt o get... basically by the time the shower came i had my room painted, my area rug down (new england hard wood floors ;)) curtains up all my wall decorations... but i got hundereds of dollars in gift certificates so i def was using those instead of cash.. then hubster went out as a suprise and bought the crib dresser and chnaging table.. so I got to use the cards for other goodies :) |`|AA11820380	Baby showers are usually a month to two months b4 due date. I would say wait to buy stuff. You can register at Target, babies R us and other stores for all that stuff including a crib changing table and everything else. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm only gonna be 10 weeks and my brother in law already said he was gonna buy the crib, they already got me the stroller. I know it's to early for me to buy stuff but i can't stop people from buying me stuff. Just wait, I know you're excited and all, but what if you buy stuff and they buy you the same things.|`|7CKipTZOaa	On the 24th week I started drawing out the plans, picked colors and started a registry, then we recieved/bought the bigger pieces such as cribs and change tables. At this point we waited for the shower decorating with some gifts from there. It is so hard not to go overboard but I recieved a lot of things at the shower so I didn't have to buy them, and then I added a couple touches and left it there to avoid cluttering before my babies even get here|`|Zy07f0Zwaa	You can buy the bigger items now and when your baby shower comes you will receive docorative items, nappies, clothing, toys, dummies etc. That's what I have done so far and I am 23 weeks. We are having my baby shower in January.<br>  <br>  Good luck xx |`|UtOVEzG3aa	well i desided not to shop for anything until i know the sex of the baby then i will start shopping, good luck!|`|gfohoYOyaa	I would start selecting your nursery furniture and find out how long delivery will take...I believe we had ours delivered when I was bout 30 weeks, but we'll be using a bassinett in our bedroom so if we didn't have the crib, it would not have been the end of the world.  I just "finished" the room last week, meaning, the walls are painted, the furniture is set up, the majority of the clothes are put away, and everything is ready for baby to be changed in there.  I am now 38 weeks pregnant.<br>  <br>  As for purchasing clothes, toys, towels, bibs, strollers, pack n' plays, etc...definitely wait for your shower.  People are very sweet and generous and we got a lot of large gifts that we didn't expect.  Also, you may find that there are some thing people gave you that you don't need or want, and you can return them to buy those things that you do.  Good luck!|`|CJqK40uFaa	i would say that you can paint the room and get the curtains and stuff like that, but did you ask for a crib, changing table, etc? if so you will have to at least wait and see if people get that at the shower. but all the other stuff i would say, about february march you can really get into it. seeing as i am due april 29th we are about on the same time line and thats about the time i will probably start doing that kind of thing. if you do it too early you might get sick of it and change it a hundred times when that nesting kicks in lol|`|DPXSLtecaa	My husband and I got the crib and changing table around 20 weeks because we ordered them online and wasn't sure how long it would really take to get them in.  Once they came in, we immediately put them together.  We got the stroller, car seat, and baby swing around 16 weeks but that was because i didn't want my style to get hard to get and it was gender neutral.  We painted the nursery and got the bedding about 2 weeks ago (at 26 weeks).  Now we are just waiting for the little things to come in but other than that, the nursery is done!  I know I'll get lots of stuff for the shower at the beginning of December but all the big stuff is done!|`|4p9sBdyTaa	Well I am 10 weeks and my hubby started the painting. He is doing several murals(of the backyardigans) and so he has a bunch of drawing and painting to do. As far as buying the crib and what not with my son we did that at about 30 weeks. Congrats, you can put your room together whenever YOU are ready. It is your pregnancy so enjoy it.|`|Fm3L8vsYaa	i got my crib around 15 weeks because i found a awesome deal. once i found out the sex i started shopping for bedding and we already had the walls painted. whatever you arent registering for make sure you have like you said at least 1 month before baby comes in case you go early. its never to early toplan and its lots of fun!!!!|`|JbkHLcAWaa	i would wait until you are at least in your third trimester. God forbid anything happen you don't want all the baby things it will hurt to see them. and you could go ahead and start before the baby shower because they usually take place a month or so before you are due. |`|l6nAcep5aa	wait till after the baby shower people are generous when it comes to babies!! im 30wks and still havent gotten the crib, theres really no rush to start the nursery but it really depends on how organised u want to be :P|`|I7myOp8Qaa	I am 25 weeks pregnant and am going to start getting the nursery together only by week 28. Im waiting for Christmas because we usually get money as gifts and we plan to put that money towards buying essentials like a crib etc. We are getting a car seat and stroller gifted to us. You might want to have your shower as early as January or February so that you know what to buy and what not to buy.
vjK8ZT20aa	Yes you can still get a pap done.  If you already have a pap scheduled, give your baby doctor a call, if you have one yet, and see if they think you should wait and just do it through them.  That way they don't have to do another one in a few months or something because it is part of the whole pregnancy routine anyway.  Congrats on your new baby.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	yes and yuck i ahve to get one my next time i go in to hear babies heart beat my 2nd appointment|`|bIvsLrCUaa	Of course you can. They Usually do one at your first visit. :)|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Yes, of course.<br>  Technically they will de several in the first few months and then they just check for general well being and dilation down there.<br>  Good luck, and congratulations!!|`|cUDUrGyBaa	when your start going in to your doctors for the pregnancy they will actually be doing a pap smear to make sure everything is A. okay done there.|`|46cbd785e6475e81fd1cbbaa46a93a81aa	oo yes for sure.....i got 3 done while i was pregoo....just so i didnt have to get any for 2 years after.....so yes u can|`|UtOVEzG3aa	you mean pap smear? sure you can my doctor did mine when i was 6 weeks pregnant, good luck|`|ZDDSMEK1aa	Well let your doctor know that you are pregnant and they will do a different type of pap since you are pregnant, not as extensive.|`|RgePPcoDaa	yea if u havent had one in the past year an dur pregnant they doctor will do one anyway. it is required the OBGYN have that test done or have the results from somewhere else|`|YibFfKs0aa	Absolutely. I got mine done at my first prenatal appointment at 6 weeks.|`|F2Ykb1hzaa	They always do a pap test at your first prenatal visit.|`|xmVGViPiaa	Your doctor will do one at your first prenatal exam, so yes.|`|GkhNUHofaa	yes..generally they will do one at your first check up anyway.|`|kNPHNBZUaa	yes they do one when you get pregnant anyways|`|2HrzW04Vaa	Yes, my doctor did mine at my firt doctor's appointment and I was about 6 or 7 weeks along.

Period.  Any kind of sex.  Protected, unprotected, while on the pill, while having your period, underwater, upside down, if he pulls out, if he doesn't, even if he ejaculated 50 times that day...any time two healthy people of reproducing age put the right parts where they go, there is a possibility of pregnancy.  I think I covered everything there. |`|16ySb3FGaa	Yes you can get pregnant from standing up, sitting down, laying down, in a hot tub, in a pool. Any time you have sex you can.|`|lMDyIEnAaa	Yes, of course you can, if you are not using any contraception.|`|AA11108482	You can get pregnant from having sex period!!|`|0qBbbfYqaa	<br>  Were you alone?<br>  <br>  If so, unlikely.|`|kNPHNBZUaa	yes 
VCrg58H5aa	 Functional defects can affect the nervous system, immune system, reproductive system, endocrine system, or other systems of the body, and may not become apparent for months or years. These may include, for example, mental retardation, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), some types of blindness and deafness, some immunological problems, and some degenerative disorders. AD/HD is a disorder that makes it hard for children to sit still, control their behavior, and pay attention. It is usually diagnosed before the age of 7, but not always. Doctors aren't sure what causes AD/HD, but studies support the theory that it is related to an imbalance of certain chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. <br>  |`|9de68204fb68bbbc0e10fc5b9880ed2eaa	Attention Deficit is acquired by the lack of parents not properly disiplining their child. I had ADHD for about a half of a day before my parents cured me. I had a few occasional relapse moments but the strong corrective action of my parents cured me very quickly. <br>  |`|PGU04L1Taa	i feel like they can be acquired...b/c people do get rid of it eventually...if they try<br>  <br>  so if it was genetically don't you think it would be with them forever|`|gPtt8e0iaa	Too many antibiotics and vaccines given at birth by careless parents.|`|AA11476807	Those of you who do not have children with ADHD and have not researched the disability need to get their facts straight and understand that this is a very difficult and serious disability!!  Unless you've been there, lived with it and seen it first hand you have no room to speak and make judgements!! |`|bbb51eeb731786c5f1db8432f39fb0a2aa	There are many who suspect mercury in a vaccine additive causes autism, but the science behind it is weak.  (Not non-existent, just weak.)|`|IllWKAUGaa	there is no known cause for autism, and it is something you are born with....and attention deficit is just a name they gave people who happen to by hyper or have poor attention, because the FDA requires something to be a disease or disorder for there to be a medication/prescription for it...
xmVGViPiaa	Hehe, I think everyone has this complaint during pregnancy.  I wake up every time I have to move because towards the end, your hips just start to ache and pop!<br>  <br>  Put a pillow underneath your belly, try arranging the pillows to make you more comfortable.  Also sleeping with your upper body elevated can help too.  My Dr told me to try and sleep on my left side, but I do have to switch sides because I get stiff if I lay on one side too long, so I am always having to wake up, roll over, and rearrange the pillows... But they will help you.  If you can lift your belly up while you are asleep with a pillow it will put less pressure on you.|`|iAgqikL7aa	You can try a body pillow. They make curved ones for pregnancy that go between your legs and then curve around up under your head as well. You can have it go across your belly for extra support or across your back if that feels better. You can also just try adding extra pillows to your bed. You just have to experiment a little and try to figure out what works best for you. Trust me - your belly is going to get bigger and it will get harder to get comfortable so the sooner you start trying different things the sooner you will start sleeping well again.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DcffYZo5aa	oh man im in the fifth month and a couple days ago i woke up in such the crankiest mood wow lol i woke my husband up and started complainin and this ....cause i can no longer be comfortable with my daughter iw as alot smaller .....her baby fat kinna went everywhere so iw as able to sleep like half on my side and half on my tummy with like one leg up ........i do that now and i get pains on both sides so now i either have to lay straight on my back which hurts also cause of all the pressure on my abdomen and on straight on either side whcih soemtimes hurts also and on my right side if i lay there my baby kicks and moves and kicks and moves as if hes un comfortable so i cant go to sleep so i adjust all over i was and still am super upset!!! last time i bought the famous body pillow it helps ....a smidge lol so unfortunetely i gave that pillow to my sister in law so i have to go buy a new one!|`|lv6gkEVaaa	Hello i so no its very un comfortable,I have 10 Weeks to go ,The only thing i can say is when you lye on your side get a pillow and put it between your legs and try and put the side of your belly on it,I hope this helps,it works for me.|`|AA11262093	Ohh it only gets worse unfortunatly!! I remember thinking that I was very uncomfortable back in my 5th month but now that Im 37 weeks(and my bellys alot bigger)I would give anything for the discomfort I had back then.The body pillow suggestion is a great one it really helped me a ton.Good luck with your restless nights and many congrats on the baby on board!!!|`|xjNkhvEiaa	I hear ya!!  The only thing I found that really worked for me was one of those long body pillows.  I slept with it between my legs laying on my side.  It seemed to off set the weight of my belly.  Good luck!!  |`|4de719cad0916a9e89de3b1afeb52cb6aa	Pillows between your knees, under your belly, behind your back...wherever it makes you comfortable!|`|rQGNLkNiaa	Put a pillow under your belly and between your legs. It helps a little, but not completely. Unfortunately it only gets worse! Good luck!|`|KmwvwT6Eaa	well my mom slet on her stomach when she was prego with me so i dont think it will hurt I did all ways but on stomach which i always didnt before i was prego so it was hard to brake from doing it. dont think there is an easy way of sleeping i had two and still never found it. for some reason having my husband hand on my stomach helped me to sleep.|`|24e8d17e05d1e676ad0be393e961a132aa	It is hard to get used to, no doubt about it! What has worked the best for me is to lay on one side and pull my top knee forward and straighten the lower leg.  Then I put a body pillow under my bent knee and sort of lean into it. You can rest your upper body on the pillow and roll your hips forward onto it a little, too, so it is *almost* like sleeping on your stomach.<br>  <br>  As the pregnancy progresses, I find it more necessary to switch back and forth from side to side throughout the night, because my hips get really stiff in any one position.  Now I just change sides every time I get up to go to the bathroom (so about every five minutes, lol).<br>  <br>  As an added bonus, my midwife says this position makes it more likely that the baby will be facing the right direction and that you won't have back labor. Woo-hoo!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps! Good Luck!
3k2utOkGaa	it sounds like ure pregnant. im 9 weeks and i tell you, you symptoms sound just like mine except i didnt bleed. it is not uncommon though. i would suggest get the test. a double pack is best so you can do the other one later if the results come out unclear thats what i did. ept is my favorite. its better you know for sure otherwise it will drive you crazy wondering am i or am i not? good luck!|`|IFqY2w1Paa	Well, you certainly have me convinced! =) I'm not sure if that's what you were looking for, but you do! =P<br>  <br>  You should wait a little while longer to take the test, just to be sure of the result. Negative tests are indeed misleading, because you could very well be pregnant with a negative test.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything! If you are pregnant, you'll be just fine! =)|`|xmVGViPiaa	Well it would really depend on when you think you conceived, or when your next period is due.  You can get an accurate result within 4 days of your next period or sometimes as soon as 10 days after you believe you conceived.  You can also get very accurate results if you get your blood drawn and a blood test taken by your Dr.<br>  <br>  Sharp pains are a sign of pregnancy but I did not start getting those until I was in my 2nd trimester (12 weeks) of pregnancy, and ever since I became pregnant I have gotten a LOT more discharge... But I suppose everyone is different.  It also sounds like your shortness of breath could be related to your sneezing, which maybe was caused by an allergy or something irritating your nose?<br>  Try not to look too into everything right now, pregnancy shares symptoms with TONS of other things.  Including stress, so if you are stressing about being pregnant it can cause you to have "symptoms."
GDClFCdNaa	I think she will be okay, she has alot of fluid around her you know. But I would definatly be calling the doctor tonight! Dont stress it though|`|3EhoJ42zaa	You should call the doctor, but chances are baby is fine.  I fell flat on my back at 19 weeks.  I fell hard and I was carrying my son at the same time.  He landed flat on my belly and he weighs a good 20 lbs.  I went straight to the doctor and everything was fine.  Baby is still fairly small and well protected by fluid.  But I would call the off hours line or call the labor and delivery unit at the hospital and talk to the nurse on duty.  |`|sBHhnDwaaa	Well, where did you land (side, tummy, back)? I fell and hit my ribs and just called them. They told me if he was still moving and I had no cramping he was fine...<br>  <br>  So, call your doctor!!|`|wtegoBQWaa	go to the hospital immediatly!

The rumbling in your tummy may be from your nerves now, just try to relax.  Get some rest and drink some water.  If you start cramping or bleeding then I would go to the ER but right now you are probably going to be fine.  It would take a LOT to hurt your baby just from a fall.|`|kJG5FFXpaa	Don't worry! I have 6 kids and have fallen during all of my pregnancies.I fell when I was 16 weeks pregnant with my twins! And it was a bad fall, right on my belly! I thought for sure my babies would be hurt, but they were fine. I went in for an ultrasound the next day. Your baby is probably just excited about all the commotion . They are really secure in their sack. .|`|TG9EqCJBaa	After any fall when you are pregnant, you should get it checked out.  But unless you landed on your belly, you should be fine.|`|xogws8vMaa	Call your doctor and get a check-up now! You could have damaged the placenta. |`|CsjR9Vwsaa	You should be OK.

Even if she was shook up, your body is Pretty complex and can take a lot of things before affecting your baby. My advice is to not worry about it unless you start to have bleeding.If that happens you will need to go to the doctor, But im sure you are just fine. Good luck with your baby :)|`|ErBi2S6Daa	just go to the hospital if you have any worries. you will never regret going, but if you don't go and something is wrong you may regret not going. best of luck to you and your baby!

MwcNwpIvaa	I was a pack a day smoker [sometimes more during stressful times!] for years before I found out I was pregnant. The first thing I did when I got the positive result on my pregnancy test was go out back and smoke a cigarette. [The baby wasn't planned, I was in shock.] My fiance was insistent I quit smoking immediately, but I can vouch it's easier said than done. I found out I was pregnant on a Friday, had my last cigarette the following Wednesday and haven't looked back since. It's been over a month. Don't get me wrong -- it's HARD. I still crave a cigarette occasionally but I think about the little baby inside me and how much I already love it and would NEVER do anything to harm it. The sooner you quit the better, obviously, but even that won't guarantee you haven't done any damage already. So just stop buying the cigarettes [you can't smoke them if they aren't there!], throw out the ones you have, and invest in a huge bag of Tootsie Roll Lollipops. That's what I did, when I feel I absolutely need a cigarette, I suck on one of those and the craving eventually goes away. Don't just do it for your baby, do it for you! That kid of yours is gonna need a healthy mommy!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Quit cold turkey!! You need to as all the critical development happens during the first trimester. The first trimester is when you need to especially becareful. Do it for the health your child, your child is soo worth it.|`|5JB1fHz9aa	My mom smoked cigarettes with all of us... my two older brothers, me and then my twin little sisters.  There is even a picture of her holding my oldest brother when he was a newborn with a lit cigarette in her hand!  I'm not exactly sure how many she smoked a day with all of us, but she did with the entire time with each pregnancy.  We were all healthy and normal weights for newborns.  Oh course they didn't know as much as they did 12-25 years ago, but if you quit now I'm sure your baby will be just fine.  Oh and in no way am I saying it is okay to smoke because I personally think it is stupid, but your baby will be okay.|`|90yjyha0aa	The effects on the baby vary in each case.  You don't need to be trying to figure out how long you can still work on quitting you just need to use all the will power you have and go cold turkey.  It will be awful, but possible.  Your baby's well being should be all you think about every time you want a cigarette.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Quitting now would be better.  Your baby is doing most of its development in the first trimester, this is a very important time!  I know several moms who threw the cigarettes out the door as soon as they got a positive pregnancy test.  You'd be smart to do the same.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I would try to quit cold turkey just to be on the safe side. Alot of people say ohhh i know this girl and she smoked and all 10 of her babies were fine, but thats not always the case with everyone. Better to be safe the sorry.|`|VBBxZV0caa	Smoking while pregnant isn't cool, and you should stop as soon as you can. The posters and stuff that you see aren't really the truth. It can cause a low birth weight/smaller than average baby. It could cause more fetal stress, and bunches of other issues.<br>  The reason is because smoking constricts your blood vessels, causing the fetus to get less oxygen and nourishment. You baby never breaths smoke or air inside you. It breaths amniotic fluid later in pregnancy, so its not like it's sitting there right now inhaling your smoke. Your smoke gets inhaled into your lungs, not your uterus. I mention this because that's what the anti-smoking campaign seems to suggest. <br>  You need to quit to ensure a safer, healthier pregnancy. You want your baby to get as much oxygen rich blood as possible, instead of nicotine tainted blood that can actually be absorbed by baby, causing him/her to be addicted. You are not killing your baby right now. However you are depriving it of obvious necessities. Think of it this way...If money were tight when Baby was born, would you buy formula or cigarettes? You'd go with her/his need, right? Well, right now it's your enjoyment over her nourishment in a different form. I know quitting is hard because I watched my husband try and try, but he did finally manage. The guilt that you're feeling should help you do the right thing. Good luck.|`|HLUhdzrXaa	Okay.  As a smoker, or soon to be former smoker (taking Chantix)  I have known a LOT of people that have smoked entirely throughout their pregnancies.  The world is not going to end if you smoke during your pregnancy.  Chainsmoking would be bad, but if you're cutting back, it's going to be completely fine.  It would be more healthy if you could quit, but SOME of us know how unbearable it is even trying.  Good luck with everything though!|`|VRSUyeqbaa	you have done very good by cutting it nearly by a 1/3...your baby will be fine, just keep cutting down, i have heard that if you stop cold, it throws your body into shock and you being pregnant will put stress on the baby...do what you are doing now and you and your baby will be ok|`|p9xOzbr0aa	Brain development happens in the first trimester. If you smoke through that there's a high chance of having a "slow" child.<br>  Quit ASAP, even the patch is better than smoking.|`|P7BQOKt3aa	Be sure to quit. You sound really committed to doing the Right thing for your babies health. If you stop now, your baby should be fine. Congratulations!|`|JRRsjByCaa	well obviously you need to quit asap so you don't do anymore harm to the baby than what is done.|`|Ol2S1ZiMaa	For your baby to be fine you should have quit smoking a long time ago!<br>  You really need to quit ASAP!|`|N1tLAoCvaa	that is baaaaaaaaaaaadd. |`|ErBi2S6Daa	One thing you can be sure of is that if you DON'T smoke, it won't harm your baby! Just stop it. I did EVERYTHING right in my pregnancy and had a special needs child. We also have an adopted baby whose mother did meth for 8 months until she delivered a healthy baby a month early, but the baby was only 4 pounds. You never know if your baby will be born healthy or not, chances are your baby will be healthy and beautiful and perfect, but do not add to bad odds. Just do the very best you can so you will not have regrets and you will know whatever God gives you, you did right by your child. You know smoking is bad for babies, you wouldn't give someone's newborn a cigarette or blow smoke in a toddler's face, so just do what you know in your heart and mind is right and throw those puppies out! My Dad did it! When my mom got pregnant he went cold turkey! He threw out the pack he had and never picked up a single cigarette again in his life. It can be done! Best of luck and many blessings to you and your angel!|`|Dl0yn8yFaa	I was smoking 2 packs before getting pregnant and 15 coffees. I cut down to 7 cigarettes a day & 1 coffee until birth.. that's the best I could do.  I had a very healthy son with no disorders, he wasn't small or anything, just a regular baby, good heart, good everything.  <br>  For all of you who are freaking out this girl, I think the stress you are causing her ain't good either.  Trying to quit smoking is a very hard thing to do, but she's on her way and doing her best is already much better than not even trying.   |`|fst29m8Haa	A lot of people believe that you shouldn't quit smoking cold turkey whilst pregnant because it is too stressful on the baby.  I personally don't agree with this and quit smoking as soon as I found out I was pregnant with my first child.  If you ask me, worrying that quitting will be too stressful is just a crutch...an excuse to keep smoking.|`|7kNuNYZqaa	Quit it today or your baby will be mentally retarded. Don't you read all the stuff about effects of alcohol and smoking on child. Be it any trimester. Don't do that to your baby. Hopefully your baby is fine. Take care of your baby, have good stuff. I have lost my twin babies and I still regret what I did. |`|YXFuIPpUaa	Stop smoking asap!<br>  the smoke will affect your baby<br>  what you breathe, it breathes. smoke is a no no.<br>  to keep your baby healthy you need to stop,<br>  whats more important:<br>  your babys health, or your smoke addiction?|`|xmVGViPiaa	Well most of your baby's development occurs in the first trimester.

fEcRHGEJaa	If the babies have not arrived already, your friend should clean out her hamster's cage, take out the wheel and provide extra bedding. Before she goes into labour she will want to nest, and make sure the bedding is the shredded paper kind, not the fluffy, fibrous kind as baby hams can get caught up in this and suffocate.<br>  <br>  She should put the cage into a warm, dark room which wont be disturbed (a cloakroom or second toilet would be ideal). once the babies arrive, your friend should not, under any circumstance, touch the babies, the mother or rearrange anything in the cage. New hamster mums can get stressed very easily and will cannibalise her pups if she suspects something is wrong. There will be some spots of blood on the bedding but this is completely normal and nothing to worry about - if the bleeding persists or there is a lot of it, seek veterinary advice.<br>  <br>  Hamsters are excellent mothers and she will know what to do. Your friend should just make sure she has plenty of food, fresh clean water and is not disturbed, except to have a quick look to see if all is ok. The babies will be born blind, deaf and hairless, and the mother will keep them warm when she is away from the bedding by covering them up, but you may be able to hear them squeaking.<br>  <br>  Hair will start to show on the babies at 5-7 days old, and they will be safe to handle from 14-15 days, although only for short periods of time. At 3 weeks, they will be fully weaned, and the males and females must be separated to prevent unwanted pregnancies. If they are syrians, at 5-6 weeks they should be kept alone to prevent fights. By this time, they should be confident enough to go to new homes.<br>  <br>  Your friend could provide foods such as a little unsalted scrambled egg or cheese to help keep her hammy's protein levels up, as well as her regular hamster food and fresh fruit/veg. When the babies start to show interest in solid food, you could try a little grated carrot or scrambled egg.<br>  <br>  Most of all, enjoy having little baby hams :)|`|etwhvalhaa	just leave them to it DO NOT TOUCHTHE BABIES cos the mum will reject them cos of ur scent and eat them!! clean around the nest but do not touch the nest, when the babies are a bit older u can move them im not sure exactly how old though.

Then she won't be pregnant, and she obviously doesn't want to be. Problem solved.|`|NDpO8hX4aa	why be terrified she wanted it or she would of used birth control.
2B2fgmw9aa	They won't take the baby away and I seriously doubt that you harmed the baby. I smoked a joint when I was 2-3 weeks pregnant, not knowing I was pregnant, and everything is fine. I know plenty of people that smoked pot their whole pregnancies and the baby turned out just fine, although I don't suggest it! As for them taking the baby away, onlyif the baby tests positive for drugs when it is born and Child Welfare feels it is a danger to the child to stay in the home will it be taken away.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and Bellsie: Pot is not addictive.....|`|ICeSfYSzaa	If it was half a brownie, I wouldn't worry. n.n<br>  Pregnant women still take communion sips at church, right?<br>  Pot doesn't hurt the baby, it just has a chance of making them addicted when they come out.<br>  But, nothing like a miscarriage should happen. n.n<br>  <br>  EDIT: Strike the addiction, it was late. x.x<br>  Nonetheless, don't worry.|`|9NC2CHQkaa	i found out i was prego at 5 weeks and befor that i smoked weed every day, large amounts. im 18 weeks not and my baby its perfect. hes healths and every thing is going right with him. you should be fine they dont do drug test they will ask you if  you have taken any street drugs you cand tell him then but you can also say no.|`|OZ3XmVDWaa	Unless you are constantly drinking heavy I wouldn't be concerned. And there are absolutaly no studies showing pot having negative affects on a fetus or baby. Not even addiction (some doctors have even perscribed marijuana to help with severe morning sickness). Your baby will be perfectly fine :).<br>  <br>  <br>  Congrats =]|`|tAFPbAUaaa	Calm down, girly. More often than not, a woman has done something she regretted before she found out she was pregnant. Your baby is going to be just fine, since you plan on taking good care of yourself while pregnant. <br>  I know that they just started doing mandatory drug tests during pregnancy, but I do not think it is until later in pregnancy. I am 31 weeks and mine was just done two weeks ago.|`|fwro8soqaa	The first thing to do is relax.  It's very very very very VERY unlikely that your baby was hurt in any way.  And they will not take your baby away.  Tell your doctor if it will ease your stress over it.  Your baby was just being fertilized while the weed was going through your system.  It's fine.  Congratulations! Enjoy motherhood.|`|NCcpjBL5aa	Your friend is winding you up, they cant take a baby off you for eating half a pot brownie when you didnt know you were pregnant!!<br>  My old next door neighbour took crack n drank all the way through her pregnancy and she is allowed to keep her child!<br>  <br>  you will be fine. x|`|H2IhRXIIaa	U should be ok...I was smoking pot...and drinking like crazy meanwhile I was 2 weeks pregnant..now I didnt know I was pregnant..I was on the pill so it didnt cross my mind..but we were at this college out of state and well yea. But my baby is doing great and ive been very healthy|`|JvbvGtrBaa	.......gowd i had intercourse to many times to count the weeks when my baby was concieved.<br>  i took 3 prego tests  that month at least a week or so apart and they  showed up negative for all so <br>  don't feel bad aabout pot brownie<br>  i did mushrooms  cocain alcohol and blunt smokin <br>  my baby is healthy and strong <br>  hes actually BIG for his week 7 ounces for 17 weeks <br>  i would have never done that stuff knowing i was prego tho but just don't continue use of drugs you'll b fine!
AA10015577	Stick in the pregnancy section and you can see questions, answer questions.  Use the search for questions option above and find resolved questions that you may be looking for.  If you can't find a particular quesion or answer then ask it!  Asking costs 5 points, answering gives you 2, logging in once a day gives you 1, voting for a best answer (if you ask the question) gives you 3, and voting for best answer to resolve a question gives you 1.  I think that you may have to be at a certain level to use some of the tools but it's a fun site to be on!  HTH!
CFFuFof1aa	I had the same thing happen with my ultrasound. My doctor said that she had more fluid than normal, but he also assured me that it would develope and everything would be fine. I had my ultrasound done at 18 weeks, normally they don't like to do one until after 20 weeks. I couldn't wait, because I was so anxious. So my doctor told me that normally it doesn't fully develope until after, so he did another ultrasound at 28 weeks just to be sure, and everything was perfect. Don't worry, everything will be fine. That's not as big of a difference(.1). Mine was more than that, and I have a beautiful, smart little 18 month old running around. Good luck and insist that they do another ultrasound at about 28 weeks.
z6IekuwSaa	I'm going to tell you from experience, it sucks to have an unusual name! It sucks really bad. First, everyone has to make a big deal about your name, and then no one ever know how to spell it. <br>  This was how it usually went<br>  My names Raeven<br>  Oh what an unusual name blahblah blah (10 min convo on where my mom got the name why they chose it)<br>  Then Raven, nope R-A-E-V-E-N<br>  It stinks. I'm not criticizing if you choose it, I'm just warning what it's like. It's not so bad for me now that raven symone has a show on disney. lol<br>  Also it sucks when you're a little girl and you want like the pencils and stuff with your name on it and you NEVER can get it. :-(|`|RjpGomsyaa	Sorry but I wouldn't choose it|`|X6as2nOAaa	It sounds a little too crazy for me.|`|kWEr4Cvuaa	Yeah, name a good name for your daughter is very important. I think your friends are not wrong. You see from the view of linguistics  many words that linked with this `Mis` has got negative meanings.<br>  `Misunderstood`, `Mislead`, many example which are somewhat as such. And now that `Mistorian` people might misunderstood as a girl with no education of knowledge of history at all whatsoever!|`|2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	makes me think of menstruation. sorry! i really don't mean to be insulting. but you do have to think of what this will put your daughter through. <br>  <br>  best wishes! and good luck!|`|6m6LjAVNaa	Please do not!<br>  Misty or Missy instead!<br>  Save made up names for your dogs or cats it will not ruin their lives kids deserve better really!Good luck!|`|OR1KcSEXaa	Thank God for friends. Listen to them.<br>  My name is Misty and I love it. I woudn't rather be called anythig else. There is a kid in my theatre class who I call Kylee and his name is Kyle. So he tries to make up a name for me but he never can xP<br>  Name your kid Misty. I's beautiful.|`|wRHhpanmaa	it is unusual..but i have an unusual name myself and i love it.<br>  <br>  i love the name mistorian, and you can even call her misty for short...|`|D2Vkk5WDaa	I really don't like it at all but it's your baby so if that is the name you ?, go for it!|`|YWatkmmxaa	I personally like it|`|4ZnqA7vgaa	yeah but i would call her misty|`|z4blIUneaa	i would agree...it comes off really strong in a bad way!<br>  what about MISTY...cuter and sounds beter
CrZxYK5raa	if he is 5 he is not going to understand why all of his toys are taken away. he knows why he went to time out and got a spanking but he will not really no why all of his toys are taken away. 5 year olds can not have a punishment last that long they will not respond well to it.<br>  talk to your brother alone and tell him how you feel.|`|j2mRop0laa	Sounds like either your brother is not consistent or they are not modeling the kind of behavior they should be, in front of the kids.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	seems fair to me. u have to teach kids respect at early age, otherwise they'll grow up talking back to everyone and will become very spoiled. my mom always smacked me on my lips for talking back and i grew up respecting my elders.|`|RyRLahS7aa	Seeing as the five year old didn't know not to back talk, this probably hadn't happened to him before. Which means your sister-in-law probably just cracked and took anger out on him.<br>  <br>  Not to say the punishments weren't deserved. Just saying you can't suddenly expect your kid to know better if you've never punished them for something like that before.|`|Fa130w6Gaa	The slapping was maybe a bit much but I can see the other punishments. Kids today get away with WAY too much and many parents seem as if they would rather me their child's friend than a parent and help raise them right. My kids get in trouble too for talking back. It is disrespectful and can lead to much worse behavior as the kids get older.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	i think one or the other would have been enough smacking him will teach him to hit if someone says something to him|`|Y3c1DRYKaa	It seems very extreme bordering on abuse|`|iZfHSwi3aa	Me thinks that you are just a LITTLE too interested in punishing children.
f4zg7LHLaa	We chose for me to stay at home with our son. i don't think either side has it easier. i know there are some days i find it so hard and would love to be able to go out to work, and i'm sure there are days when working mums dread having to go to work and leaving their child.<br>  <br>  i count myself extremely lucky to be able to stay at home, but if it would leave us in a bad situation financially, i would go to work in an instant. being a SAHM is a full time job. sometimes it is easier than others, and boy would it be nice to get paid for it! but getting to see our son do all his 1sts, is worth much more to me.|`|a8IRxC4raa	I chose to be a SAHM.  I don't regret the choice. I don't think moms who work outside the home have it easier.<br>  <br>  I do think we need to support each other rather than compete with each other.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Well before we got married, we decided that I would be a SAHM because we hoped to have a family. And we had our first two years after we were married. I was the higher income earner, so this took tons of work to figure things out, how to live more cheaply, etc. but all of it has been totally worth it! Our family is better off, and our marriage stronger.<br>  I had been a teacher, so I did try to do some part time tutoring in the evenings/weekends when my husband could watch our son; and substituted for a while - but once we moved to a larger city, the timing of the day just didn't work out at all.<br>  <br>  As for the debate - I don't think either side has it 'easier' - it's simply a choice. Women need to be supporting women, whatever their choice has been - THAT is what feminism is all about.<br>  But I wouldn't have wanted to miss all this - for the world!|`|dDVAUA9saa	I chose to return to work when my  daughter was 10 months old.  She is now almost two and has been in the same daycare for 14 months.  <br>  <br>  Both working full time and staying home full time have it's benefits and drawbacks.  Working full-time is very stressful while raising a child and maintaining a household.  It means you work all day, spend time with your children after work and then stay up late cooking, cleaning and doing laundry.  But it makes you appreciate your children much more and enjoy the precious time you spend with them.  You are less frustrated but more stressed out from being so busy.<br>  <br>  Staying home full-time is more frustrating, but much less stressful.  You have all day to clean, cook and do laundry.  I found I could spend more time with my husband when he came home from work and on week-ends because I could do the errands and cleaning, etc. during the week days.  the drawack is some women find it more frustrating and find it difficult keeping their children occupied.<br>  <br>  I am going on mat leave April 9th and CAN"T WAIT to be home with my daughter!|`|pnL5WTXMaa	i have been a full-time working mother, a part-time working mother, a stay at home mother and back again.<br>  <br>  I recently went back to staying at home. i really didn't know how good i had it (luckily i have somewhat of a choice). it's harder in many ways than working. but it is more fulfilling because i realized that it is my real job for now. even though it can be isolating and thankless at times. they won't be little forever either. <br>  <br>  the only regret i have was working full-time when my son was young. part-time is fine, but it is really not healthy to leave a child in daycare over 30 hours a week. i didn't know that at the time. not that i had much of a choice though. if i could do it all over again, i would have made sure that i didn't have to work or at least didn't have to work so much.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	We looked in to the cost of child care and the cost of me staying home with our daughter. Where we live its cheaper for me to stay home with our daughter. So actually im very very lucky that i get to stay home. When my children are in preschool ill start working part time and once they are in kindergarten Ill work full time.|`|RHX1yFb5aa	Well I had to work because my (now ex) husband would not work. I went to work 2 weeks after giving birth. I had to work a full time day job and part time night time job so I had no time to spend with her. I know I did the best I could for my baby since if I wouldn't have gone back to work we would have been homeless, but I do wish I would have had more of an opportunity to have a close bond with my daughter.  Now she is 6 and stays with me, but she has a better relationship with her dad since he was a stay at home parent for 4 years.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i originally planned on returning to my full time job and putting my daughter in day care but after she was born i refused.  i gave up a good paying full time job and stayed home for one year which i loved. that year went so fast and i cant imagine missing out on all of the little things that happened i loved being with her every minute,  now i work part time( 2 -3 evenings a week) and its works well for us.  Me not having any income was a huge strain for us especially with the added expenses of a new baby and the part time work helps with that.  I also aprreciate the time to myslef to go be an adult and be around coworkers and feel productive in a different way.  I will admitt that i have been working part time for a year now though and it hurts my heart everytime i leave for work and have to say bye to my little angel knowing i wont see her for hours but i know that me working makes life easier on her and helps me be a better balanced mom.   i also have friends who went back full time right away and used day care adn are very happy with the situation. its  different for everyone and you have to figure out what works best for you and your family.|`|VjF1F0vBaa	I've managed to do both.  I knew once my daughter was born I wouldn't want to return to teaching and have to leave her in childcare for hours at a time.  I have two grown up children and knew how quickly they grow up and didn't want to miss the first years before she started school.  But on the other hand I couldn't afford not to go back to work. When my daughter was just turned one I became a childminder.  I stay at home with my daughter and look after other children as well.  I  earn very good money (not as much as teaching, but by the time you take childcare costs and petrol into account there is little difference financially).  I have been able to be there with my daughter and now she has started school I have decided to carry on childminding so I am able to take her to school and be there when she comes home.  I can also attend assemblys and sports days.  <br>  My job isn't easy, I am responsible for other peoples babies and children and have to fulfil many requirements set by Ofsted, but I consider myself lucky that I have managed to combine being a full time mum with working fulltime (upto 50 hours per week).  I am full of admiration for those mum's that decide to return to full time employment, it can't be easy leaving their children, but I hope that people like myself can help make it easier for them by providing a safe, caring and happy place for their children to stay.   I have a fantasic relationship with the children I look after and their parents and many have become very good friends.|`|mxFZnj0uaa	I am a mother of one working full time. I think that staying home is harder than working to be quite honest. Working gets me out of the house and helps me provide more efficiently for my family. I hate when ppl are rude to mothers who work full time. I believe its different in each case. If I had 3kids, it may be cheaper for me to stay home than pay for daycare. I think u should do what is best for your family. I personally think it is every ones responsibility to provide the best possible life style for their family. My mother babysits for me, which is amazing. I understand how some mothers would not want to put there kids in daycare for hours. I would say dad works during the day, and mom works part time evening.... or vise-a-verse.|`|VHHis05Naa	I made the choice to be a SAHM, but I do wish for the grown-up world of a career sometimes.  I don't resent anybody of anything for a choice I made that was best for my family, and I don't think anybody has it easier.  It's hard to be a mother either way, and I think we should all give each other a break.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I am a stay at home dad. It was a choice. My wife thought she would be a stay at home mom but in less then a year realized it wasn't for her. We both worked until my son was in first grade. I was a strong believer in someone at home. I started a business that allowed me to work when he was at school and I would be here when he wasn't. When we had my daughter I wasn't able to care for her and keep my business going like I wanted to. I then shut down the business. I don't regret raising my kids but I still have difficulty with the fact it's me and not my wife doing it. I will never have the career I envisioned but the trade off is the time I have spent with both my kids. I don't believe someone that has their kids in daycare can possible know their kids as well as I know my on. Keep in mind my son was in day care for the first part of his life. I don't know if its easier because with day care your always rushing around. Get up in the morning, get to daycare and work. Pick them up at night,dinner, cleaned up, and then a story for bed. Not many of those good moments there.  <br>   I know this is all over the place sorry about that.
tSEA42Uraa	Not really. I went to a school full of superficial morons, with the rare overweight person. I'd be friends with "fat" and "smelly" ones, because they were much nicer than the anorexic and bulimic idiots.<br>  <br>  ETA: Yes, Violet, I was bullied. Bullied for being just five pounds overweight, for having glasses, for having braces, for liking to read, for liking to be alone, and for getting all As. Did that bother me? Emotionally, yes. That's why I didn't dare hurt anyone else like I was hurt. I knew the damage it did, and I'm still repairing my self-esteem. I just pride myself on the fact that I'll be their boss one day, watching them be school janitors and mail room workers.|`|iFXe1Obvaa	Yes, I have. I even started it once. I felt terrible about it after, and now whenever I hear anyone talk about others I make them shut up. It's wrong and cruel, and the people who do it don't think about how the person they talk of will feel. now I know how it feels, because high school was a *****.<br>  <br>  Everyone talks about other people, and everyone is talked about by others.|`|sMuMfuAgaa	I probably mildly have.Normally I'm the one who has to listen to everyone talking about people like that because...well sad to say that's just what my friends do.I'm also pretty sure that any smelly-overwieght person has mad fun of someone who's worse than them or those stuckup people who think they are better than everyone, now I definately do that.|`|RAgWVuu4aa	No...I was kind of that person in middle school. In elementary school I was made fun of for being weird, shy, and wearing weird clothes...In high school I'm the weird, shy loner kid. I don't make fun of people...That's never the kind of thing I've done, because I've always understood how crappy it feels.|`|MrNkNnhyaa	well,yes i have,BUT the dude said he took mud baths(like he said he bathed in mud).<br>  and yes i do regret it,but he was a jerk and when people did try to be his friend just to be nice,he would say he doesn't want friends.<br>  <br>  :\|`|nZVmkZSBaa	Yes. I have. And unlike the other people who will answer, I won't lie about it. I do feel pretty bad afterwars though. :]<br>  <br>  BTW, anybody that says they haven't is just plain lying. Unless of course, they are the person that is getting//gets bullied. Aha. xD|`|h52mKmdsaa	yea i have fekt bad afterwards n crap i think every 1 does it in a point in there life!lol|`|E6T9DPT9aa	Afraid so.<br>  <br>  Kids can be so cruel.<br>  <br>  xxx|`|hdr9T8Viaa	i sure have! when i was about 10 there were these children in my year who clearly have mental disabilities (but being a idiot kid i had no idea!) and we didn't like them and thought they wer'e silly and stupid and made fun of them but now im 15 and finally realised a few years ago that they weren't stupid but had metal dysabilities and i feel AWFUL! now i work with disabled children and they are the sweetest children ever! and i still feel like a total evil little pig! kids can just be like thats different i don't like it/them and by the time you realise it's NOT bad just because it's/theyr'e different, it's just too darn late/bad!|`|baEs4ZcJaa	Yes. I feel bad; cause she was really nice but just misunderstood& didn't have the best of a family you can have.|`|E7ViD8EWaa	Yes...<br>  Only once though!<br>  I felt horrible afterwards...<br>  So I was nice to them and now they are one of my best friends! <br>  <br>  =]|`|nKSmgjylaa	No, I haven't.<br>  I was bullied about my weight before.<br>  It feels horrible and you end up hating school because of it.<br>  I would NEVER put anyone else through it.|`|CIUAIxXaaa	Yeah, I never called him fat or anything, I just go along with my friends and laugh. When I was little, this one girl used to pick on me(not for being fat but, just because I was smaller than her, for no reason). When that girl picked on me, I use to feel really bad. I never talk about him, he just stinks really bad. I actually talk to him, just because nobody else is his friend. His family lives at a trailer park and people call him trailer trash, which I don't think is right. One day he didn't have money for the 1.5 mile run we had to do in gym, I bought him a water(He's really nice if you get to know him)..|`|2QvIM81Haa	Yes, but the thing is, I tried to be nice and get to know him, but he was really rude, smelled bad, and he was just a jerk!|`|J3H3C5ksaa	Okay, don't tell me I'm lying because I'm not.<br>  <br>  There is a guy who IS very annoying & everyone sort of bullies him.<br>  Even my friends. But I don't, I actually tell them to stop & back off.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	oh yes.<br>  call me a bad person but.....
jPwPczodaa	Awww my daughter has just went through that too.<br>  Sudocream isnt actually a great cream, its been proved to dry out the little ones skin! so my doc said ,so we bought Metanium and no word of a lie, it worked wonders!!!!<br>  Also when he has nappy rash try and use a warm flannel instead of wipes. It doesnt sting as much and make sure his little bum is completely dry before applying cream and putting nappy back on.<br>  Also let him run around while youre in the house with no nappy on. The air is great for healing too!|`|ddcv6Gwkaa	My son had a rash that sounds like your son's, due to using antibiotics some time ago.  I ended up going back to the docs, for him to prescribe a cream for it, since nothing else worked, and the poor kid was in pain.  The prescribed cream worked - not sure what it was called, but I think you need to go back to the docs about it.<br>  You don't want open sores getting infected, if he won't let you wipe him because it's too painful.|`|38adceb98db8f7e8157835f513cf1674aa	try caldecen power or Vaseline worked wonders on my 3|`|L75kWYehaa	Sudocrem isn't particularly a good nappy cream.  Try Bepanthen, but if your son is in pain with this it could be that the bacteria in the faeces is spreading and causing open wounds.  He will need something on prescription from the doctor which has antibiotic content.|`|J1stiMioaa	one thing that helped with my son was to rinse and wring out the baby wipes so they had no lanolin/baby wipe related chemicals on them and just wet them with warm water, it didnt seem to sting as much|`|ZVCm3XAEaa	Poor wee soul!  My girl had bad nappy rash and I found Bepanthen fantastic, almost cleared it up overnight.  Hope you don't mind me saying but he may also have thrush, when my daughter had particularly bad nappy rash I took her to the Doc and she said it was thrush and suggested I used Canesten cream.  Hope this helped and it clears up soon.|`|3F77EM46aa	wipe completely and use alot of baby powder...<br>  <br>  just regular baby powder... your brand i haven't heard of, but use wsomething else, it obviously doesn't work...|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	desitin worked great for me <br>  but if it gets wore u need to take him to the doctor<br>  <br>  also frequent changes for pee & poo make it worse|`|Y6K9jwXzaa	he may have a yeast infection (yes, boys can get them too) and he needs a prescription cream.

If he loved it at the soft play place he'll probably be thrilled to have one of his own lol|`|50lIaC8zaa	Oh i love those little cars they have been around forever, my nephew had one when he was little. :)<br>  Im sure he would love one!<br>  <br>  In answer to you other Q yep im bored too, kids are in bed boyfriend at work! *sigh* bored bored bored!!!! lol|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Were are you?  My daughter is napping but it's only 2:30 in the afternoon here in New York.<br>  <br>  And the cars are adorable...if he likes them then get him one.|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	Saturday night TV is useless, I would recommend a good ebaying session, lol, what about flogging that expensive gear your mum bought for Reece & putting the cash towards something else you pick out on there? (of course all of this can be done with a glass of wine in hand)<br>  <br>  You could choose some fave piccies of Reece to make a "babies 1st year" photo album, write in his baby record book if he has one.<br>  <br>  have a long hot bubble bath with candles, pluck your eyebrows, wax your legs, paint your nails etc. <br>  <br>  Uhhhhhhhhhm, eat (that's what I do when I am bored)<br>  <br>  ooooh I've always loved that car (I got stuck in my little brother's one when I was about 10 lol) Get it, he'll love it and it'll get loads of use this summer!!|`|mhfgvvrJaa	I never get bored because I always have so much to do. With entertaining the children all day and getting my housework done as soon as they crash I read a book, do some knitting or catch up on some time with my husband. <br>  <br>  As for the car, I would get him a present he could play with immediately as I'm sure you're not so irresponsible to give him something that isn't age appropriate.|`|966w9UQTaa	I'm pretty bored too. I had twins on Wednesday, and I am still in hospital with them (as they are a month early and the doctor's want to monitor them). I have just fed them both and they're sleeping. The babies' father is getting some of my stuff from my house. I have nothing to do.<br>  <br>  Those little cars are adorable. My little cousins have them. I think they're a perfect present. It doesn't matter that they're for 18months if he can use them safely.|`|J1stiMioaa	i would re phrase that, i dared to ask similar once and i got SLATED even to the point of saying i dont deserve kids, just because i said i was bored! bloomin trolls lol<br>  those cars are great, we are getting our little one for his 2nd b'day!|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	i'm in the us so its just 2:30pm here lol<br>  but my son is taking a nap and my husband is working, so i'm bored too.<br>  i think that would be a great gift for his birthday :)|`|AA12126412	go with the little cars i am sure he will love them good luck and enjoy the peace and quiet while you can
c26ifpPDaa	take another test in the morning when you first pee.  pee in a cup and dip that way you know the stick is saturated.  if you still get a negative then just go to the doc and have a blood test done.|`|3pIBqvWMaa	my tests come back negative till i was 9 weeks gone..dont know why do a morning sample if no joy see ur gp
E4c3O39laa	I have no clue as to what is really going on in your house but I had a doctor tell me once to trust your instincts.  If you are having "feelings' about your husband, then go with it.  Better be safe than sorry.|`|rDPADat1aa	If he has a history of abusing you, the woman he vowed to love and honor for the rest of his life, why are you trusting him alone with your daughter? <br>  <br>  If you suspect something's going on, ask him about it.  That's all you can do.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|vGxipYJnaa	I don't mean to be rude.. but if you're even questioning that your husband may be abusing your little girl while you're at work - then there are serious relationship issues here. You shouldn't be with anyone who you think has the capacity to harm your precious little girl.|`|4sjW4Ig5aa	You're being paranoid, and not very trusting of the man you love and married. <br>  <br>  He's not abusing her. She's having a blast toying with y'all's emotions. Tell him to quit trying to kiss and hug her. Have him play "hard to get". Watch her change the game. Little ones can be like this. Mine did it, I've seen others do so as well.

AA12195425	Safari/Jungle is a hit with baby showers. My wife did one with Madagascar.|`|AA10583031	When I had my baby shower (and I had a boy as well) I did an animal theme type shower. It was acctually pretty cute. You could also just do a color theme, maybe blue's and yellows and greens would be cute :) Or even just a pregnant theme. Ive seen them at party city. Maybe try going to a party store locally and just checking out what they have. Thats how I ended up finding mine. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!|`|AA11814573	go to part city or babies r us or some kind of part store where they have part stuff. look on the internet|`|1e2cb40ab2131b78fff9ca6e07f40eabaa	Winnie the Pooh?|`|AA11908528	Do you need a theme?

You could have 'baby' things such as baby hotdogs etc
s4LWmcTjaa	My parents never showed their fights or arguments.  For me that did me a disservice as well because I didn't know that fighting was normal in a marriage until I got married.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for the fights and arguments you had to listen to and be apart of.  At least you get to say "It stops NOW with my family".  Here's on opportunity for you to do otherwise for your family.  <br>  <br>  When you and your husband have an argument, try your best to do it behind closed doors when you can or if you cannot fight "fairly".  Once it escalates from a disagreement into a shouting match, then it's time to put the issue away and address it again when you are both calm.  That's what my husband and I try to abide by when it comes to arguments.  Sometimes we don't always get it right, but most of the time we do.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Nothing really. It went on from when I was 10 to 16. Longest divorce ever. But really it had no impact on me besides made me want to actually find a good husband I wouldn't fight with.|`|j2mRop0laa	My parents used to make me nauseous with their fighting. I felt jittery and always wanted to vomit in that house. Very screechy yelling over the dumbest things.<br>  <br>  We try not to fight and if we do our fights are rarely not met without a few jokes that have us laughing while bickering. And we NEVER yell during our fights-unless the kids aren't home. I have let it all out years ago a few times.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	I am now very rude and mean. I have a short temper and im not a friendly person..you have to really really get to know me. Im either your best friend or worst. It sucks. I have to calm my temper..esp now that im 6 monts preg. But its hard. And I deff dont want my baby girl getting into my habits cause she sees me..|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Well, My parents fought verbally a lot.<br>  I have a short temper. <br>  Its hard for me to actually talk to males..even though I still do. I just get scared REALLY easily that's including adult males.<br>  I picked up yelling.|`|NBBRWd5Gaa	i think people who flight like that should never get married or if they do, they should never have children.  my parents fight like they want to kill each other (for all i care, they might as well, because their trilling voices make me anxious and give me hypertension). in my opinion their marriage was a mistake, and i myself am a mistake.  <br>  <br>  at 26 right now, i don't find the idea of getting married particularly attractive (i've also got a temper issue that i am constantly trying to control and feel like history might repeat if i get married), and i think that whatever little love people manage to hang onto in what they make believe is a "successful" marriage is not worth all the physical violence and verbal abuses.  only those who are selfish, irresponsible and inconsiderate would flight like that in front of their children, especially children who are young and impressionable.  people like them don't deserve the role of parenting because they themselves need to grow up first; until they can learn to be peaceful and civil towards each other and start acting like intelligent human beings, they should keep their animal instincts in check and refrain from reproducing.  they'd be doing a big favor for the unborn. it's way too late for me, however, so i hope my children (if i ever decide to have any) will be better off than me.|`|sB5dyaczaa	Every time my parents fought they would take it out on me and would beat me. I ended up in the hospital many times. Then I was put into foster care.

I was 2 years old when he started beating me. <br>  But I also hated their fighting. My family had a routine, dad comes home from work, gets drunk, hurts me, mom sticks up for me, family gets in fight. My older siblings would try and hold my dad from my mom. We had bags already packed and hidden "just in case" and it was my job to get my younger sister and the bags into our mini van. Then I would have to run to the nearest neighbors and let them know that nothing had happened and we were all just rough-housing. <br>  But it had a huge effect on me. From the moment I knew how to pray on my own I always prayed he wouldn't kill me or my mom. Now I'm 18 and have been out of his house 4 years. <br>  I am living with my fiance and everytime we get in a little arguement I go crazy thinking he'll hurt me. He's never so much as threatened me. I'm still not a fighter. I cry and get completely upset over one disagreement. I have a hard time trusting. I have panic attacks in my sleep. I've seen numerous counslers. They all say the same things.. I have post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, panic attacks, etc. I'm scared of most things and to be honest I'm just a big baby. I have a lot of health problems due to the stress that was in my house. Including ulcers, heart problems, etc. I cant say that I resent my dad. I love him very much. But sometimes I find myself thinking about him dying, and i feel kind of relieved. <br>  I guess it all depends on the fighting and how bad it is. I think when every night is a draw for blood and hair being pulled out it can be traumatizing. For me I felt safer sleeping in my uncles house where he did meth in front of me then I did sleeping down the hall from my own dad. But my cousin who was my age was there for me. The two of us would lock ourselves in the bathroom and turn on curling irons or get hairspray, going over all the ways we could fight my dad off. She'd always tell me that whenever I was ready we'd run away :) I think that's what kept me sane. <br>  The enemy for me was never monsters or bad guys, it was my dad. But i dont think you should every fight in front of children if you are going to fight, any amount of contention can be traumatic to a child. And I know once i have my own baby, i would die before I ever laid a hand on it. And I could never in a million years hurt my fiance. He went through a similar childhood so I worry about how we'll raise our own children. But I know he thinks the same as me. <br>  You can either be exactly like your parents, or you can break off, learn from what they did, and be your own person. :)
NWxlu17vaa	I said "Oh My God, she's so beautiful"<br>  <br>  I will never forget when I was talking to her while they held her in front of me.

4Dc44BC5aa	My friend had her nippled pierced for several years also, when her daughter was born she breasted fed her. The only slight problem she encountered was the first few days the milk came out of a few spots from where the piercing was. But after that everything worked well and she breast fed for several months.|`|lGcpXteaaa	No it wont affect anything, i had my nipple pierced for 2 years before i gave birth and my Dr assured me it was just fine to breastfeed after.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Hi I found some information Kellymom regarding this issue. Hope it helps.<br>  "There is no evidence that pierced nipples will affect your ability to breastfeed. Your breasts will still produce adequate milk for your baby, and unless your body rejected the piercing right after you had it done, there is no reason to anticipate any additional problems with infection. Horizontal piercings are more common than vertical, and seem to be more compatible with nursing.<br>      You will need to remove the jewelry when you nurse. Leaving it can cause problems. It will be difficult for your baby to form the nipple and press it against the roof of his mouth if there is a piece of metal in the way. Latching on correctly at the breast is a skill that newborn babies have to learn, and it can take awhile for them to get the hang of it even with an un-pierced nipple.  While it may be possible for him to latch onto a nipple with jewelry in it, it will make it more difficult for him, and may cause pain as the ring presses against the soft tissue of his tongue and palate.  Healthy babies are born with a very strong suck, and it's entirely possible that the ring could dislodge while he's nursing and he might choke on it.  <br>      It would be best for you to remove the rings completely for the first few weeks of nursing.  Newborn babies nurse a lot (10-12 times or more in 24 hours) and it would be a hassle to keep taking them in and out that often.<br>      Once your milk supply is established and your baby isn't nursing as often, you can replace the rings between feedings if you want to.  I can't guarantee that the holes won't grow back together in that time, but if you replace the jewelry once a day and then take it out, that should help keep the holes open.  <br>       It can take about three to six months after piercing for the hole to heal completely. It is recommended that you not remove the rings for six to ten months after you have them pierced, and you may need help removing them for the first time, so contact a piercer for advice on the best way to do it.  Pierced nipples may be more sensitive than unpierced nipples, so you may experience a little more soreness than most nursing mothers.<br>       As far as different types of jewelry goes, it is best to use titanium, nickel-free gold, platinum, niobium or surgical stainless steel jewelry because many people are allergic to nickel, which is commonly used in jewelry manufacturing. You would have to ask your piercer about what designs are easiest to take in and out, but remember that the rings that are easiest to remove are also the ones most likely to come out in the baby's mouth, so be sure to take them out before nursing"<br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeedingbasics.com/html/ask/pierced.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeedingbasics.com/html/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVJunJul99p64.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVJun...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/bfhelp-mother.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/...</a>|`|SbQkVqYOaa	First let me say congrats on your lil baby boy and on your decision to breast feed.  Like you, I had my nipples pierced for 8 years and just recently took them out to breast feed my son.  I haven't had any problems and my son is now 4 months old and he breast feeds like a pro.  As always keep in mind that all babies are different as well as us mothers, just keep trying if at first you don't succeed and I'm pretty sure you'll be breast feeding and bonding in no time.  Hope this helps...

CaE3JOMbaa	I agree with everything, although I really like the name Madison.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Madison is pretty. Mason is definitely more of a boy's name. Maxton is boyish too. They're pretty bad choices for girls. :-)|`|vKEYa8aeaa	mason and maxton both sound like boy names to me! theyre both VERY masculine sounding, ESPECIALLY maxton!|`|BGIsuNMTaa	I quite like all the names together because they all match but apart I wouldn't like them. I like madison for a girl and mason for a boy and I think with the right look they could pull it off, like a little pretty blonde girl, I think some big chubby girl would look awful with the name.|`|mvKbfkhGaa	Madison is definetly a girl's name in my opinion or i wouldnt have named my daughter Madyson. I don't really care about the names background...like oh it comes from a masculine meaning...Who cares? The other 2 names are boy's names in my opinion!<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH....poor innocent little girl? Wow....it's a beautiful name for a girl! Never asked your opinion..THANKS!|`|vGxipYJnaa	I dislike all three names. Especially Maxton. The other two aren't made up at least.|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	I don't like those names at all. Awful for little girls.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Madison and Mason are both masculine boy names and horrid for a little girl. Maxton is made up and sounds masculine. Poor little girls. Sounds like their mother really wanted boys instead of girls. Not only that, they are terribly matchy. As if they did not want them to have seperate personalities. Just because they are triplets does not mean that they are not three, separate people. Hopefully they will change their names when they are older.<br>  <br>  And poster above, Madison is not a girl's name. Never will be. It is masculine sounding, has the masculine -SON ending, and has a masculine meaning, It is masculine in all aspects and therefore a male's name. Just because you slapped it on your poor innocent daughter and gave it a trashy spelling does not make it feminine or a girl's name.|`|R1cey1Evaa	Ew. Mason is cute, and so is Madison, but Maxton is absoutley horrible for a little girl.|`|TrBoPj92aa	madison is pretty mason again is cute i agree better for a boy but its definatly a unisex name so no harm done there but maxton wow that must be a boys name why didn't she call her maria or madeline or mollie|`|SWsDa1iXaa	Why do you care what their names are? Concentrate on giving them their education, not their names.|`|ct8MWxJOaa	mason seems like a guys name to me<br>  and yea maxton is deffidently a guys name<br>  thats really strange...<br>  haha|`|iqku0QOQaa	they sound like a complete joke! and yes they are boys names, i feel sorry for them tbh|`|z4blIUneaa	there girls?.......all these names are for boys!!|`|966w9UQTaa	I love Madison.<br>  I like Mason and Maxton - for a boy!<br>  For a girl, they just seem weird.<br>  Sometimes I like masculine names for girls, but not this time.|`|vjiQLaaQaa	i think the parents were going for one of each category: common, somewhat common, and crazy|`|MSDlHrMTaa	idk my name is matson and im a boy
fwro8soqaa	You would definitely know by 4 months if your girlfriend was pregnant.  That would be almost halfway through the pregnancy!  Also, the fact that she got her period twice is a pretty good indicator that she isn't.  Spotting is a possibility for pregnant women, but by four months, there would be many signs that she was pregnant.  If she's a teenager, irregular periods are fairly common, as her body is still growing and her hormones are still wacky.  Even older women have irregular cycles sometimes.|`|UdICTUnaaa	shes probably not pregnant... if she was 4 months pregnant, her stomach would be getting a lump by now|`|3jApvLVBaa	there is no True thing as safe sex. it works 4 99% but she could b part of the 1% i would go out and by a pregnancy test|`|72Fjnwz9aa	Are You absolutely positive it did not break? Even a small tear or improper fit on the penis could cause a malfunction. Have her take a pregnancy test..It is a common misconception that you can not have your period while pregnant..you can..well you can't but she can ;-). If she is afraid to buy a test you can buy it, if it is negative and you are still worried go and have her do a blood test at a doc's office. Good Luck.|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	if the condom didint bust then she is not pregnant but i mean two months no period i would ask her to speak to her doctor|`|fFpCAG1Jaa	it's possible anything is possible get a test and good luck|`|9g3Q9R79aa	A girl's cycle can mess up for a number of reasons. Most likely she is not pregnant. But just to be safe buy a cheap test and get it over with! She is most likely off because she has been stressing over it so much! One you get it over with, you will both feel better. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7197926738c6345db095d2af690ca509aa	Firstly, good on ya that you are worried. There are enough jerks these days who don't give a ****.<br>  <br>  Second, just take the pregnancy test. I know it's not pleasant. But you have to do it. It will give u a peace of mind.|`|552DEFgvaa	MAYBE NO BECAUSE IF THAT HER STOMACH CAN BE A WATERMELON NOW!!!!! but to be shure take the pregnancy test so u can be mind safe and GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!

tSKBsbIyaa	Hey friend even i have experienced the same, when i got married, in early few monthsmy cycle was regular and then got irregular. <br>  If you are sure you are not pregnant, and your cycle delaying for more then 4-5 days, you should concern a gynaec. It could be just a hormonal imbalance or at times stress.<br>  Nothing to worry if the delay is for 1-2  days.|`|5EfJu34taa	its perfectly normal,no need to worry<br>  <br>  <br>  but tell me one thing-are you a male or female???<br>  bcoz you are asking us about your skipped periods & your name is saurabh!!!|`|9NC2CHQkaa	there is alot of things that can make your period late, stress, excercise, not eating right.. the list goes on.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Just stress.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	No one could tell you that.

VKQzj4Pmaa	I had drop-in bottles for a while, and after washing I just let them sit in my everyday dish drainer, or I wiped them dry with a towel. They're pretty easy to clean and use, so I wouldn't go out investing in anything extra just for drying purposes.<br>  <br>  I hope I understood your question and answered it correctly!
AA11432707	You'll probably have a spinal.  It's like an epidural, but the needle is much smaller, and the block is denser.<br>  <br>  You do NOT want to have general anesthesia if you can avoid it.  It is MUCH riskier for you and the baby.  In fact, on the rare occasions when I have a patient that insists on general, I make her write a statement into her chart that she realizes that she is putting herself and her baby at higher risk.<br>  <br>  General anesthesia for C-section requires a breathing tube and a ventilator.  We are limited with how much we can give you, because of danger to the baby, so the chance of awareness under anesthesia is increased.  The gases also cause uterine relaxation, which is bad after delivery, and can cause you to bleed excessively.<br>  <br>  We can do it safely when we have to, but we'd really rather do the spinal because it is SO much safer, and we're all about safety.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Epidurals rock!!!!<br>  <br>  I had one..I'm fine.|`|AA11066099	Hi, my sister had both and i have to say the difference was dramatic, she was really messed up with the general and it took a lot longer for her to get over.The Epidural was more closer to giving birth and she said it was well better experience and she got to stay awake,recovered much faster too.Good Luck..xx|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I had a spinal which just makes you numb from the chest down granted you can still feel the pulling and tugging but no pain.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	sister had to have spinals with her c-sections|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Well, first of all you do not HAVE to have a repeat cesarean.  You can stay with this doctor-no matter what he wishes, they can not do anything to you without your consent so you can simply refuse a cesarean if you want or you can find another doctor that is more open to a VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Cesarean).<br>  <br>  That said, my first chlid was born via emergency cesarean section.  I was under general anesthesia.  I missed hearing her first cries, and it took longer before I could have her in my arms.  Also, yes-this sometimes crosses over and causes the baby to be born sleepy which could end up with a NICU stay for monitoring.<br>  <br>  My second chlid was born via a successful VBAC (without pain medications).  <br>  <br>  With my third child, we anticipated another VBAC, but she, too, was born via emergency cesarean.  This time, I had a spinal rather than general anesthesia.  I do highly recommend the spinal!  I was very alert during the delivery, and was holding and nursing her within half an hour.<br>  <br>  If you are having a planned cesarean, I do not even think they will use general anesthesia.  It is usually reserved for when there is no time to administer an epidural or spinal.  Obviously, if it is planned there will be time so the general might not even be an option for you.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best!|`|NSJpbtRHaa	Go epidural honey, general anaesthetic will make your baby groggy and you'll find it harder to bond with each other and breastfeed also if that's that you're intending to do. That can mean that baby ends up being more cry-ey, more fussy, more fractious, etc in the long term... so not worth the risk really.  Epidural wil leave you in a state of awakeness that is better for you and your baby's first moments together.  Try and get them to put the baby on you with skin-to-skin contact straight away after delivery.  They can stitch you up with him lying on your belly/chest.  That will soothe and reassure baby a lot given that the normal hormones of labour haven't kicked in to make him feel like he has been born.  Also, general anaesthetic depletes your body of a lot of minerals and vitamins, which can take up to a year to fully recover from (even though the obvious effects of generals only last for a week or a few weeks).  You are gonna need all the vits and mins you can get to a) feed your baby and/or b) look after him in his first months.  Go epidural if you can!  :)|`|72Fjnwz9aa	Well my question is do you want to hear the baby's first cries? With and epidural you will be awake..with general you will be sleeping. Generals tend to go to the baby and make them groggy..and you may not be able to see he/she right away..Its your choice but I am scheduled for a C on the 26th and for me the epidural is the way to go..I want to hear the little bugger that has been terrorizing my insides...lol..Inform yourself to make the right choice for you.|`|UdICTUnaaa	epidurals are the way to go! it TOTALLY eliminates the pain... the nurses had to hold my paralized legs up to push, i couldnt feel the contractions so they had to tell me when to push. <br>  <br>  i had very minor back pain occasionally for about 3 months.... then it went away and im fine...|`|9g3Q9R79aa	I have heard... (from my doctor and Lamaze instructor) that General anesthesia goes to the baby. the epidural doesn't. This would be the deciding factor for me. I wouldn't want my baby being drugged.|`|apALY0sqaa	I had an emergency c-section with my first, and they put in an epidural and then put me in twilight sleep. I felt nothing, and remember almost nothing. I was in surgery for roughly 2 hours and can remember less than 2 minutes! Not to mention I slept the first 4 hours of my daughter's life away- I hate that I missed it!<br>  <br>  I have had to schedule a c-section for this baby as well- for medical safety- and I am planning on JUST the epidural, unless there is a medical reason for more. I want to be present for this baby's birth and there for the first diaper change and bath- things I missed the first time.<br>  <br>  Epidurals are very effective and safe, and that's all most women need. It doesn't affect the baby as a general does, and that makes baby alert and awake for feeding and that much needed bonding time! Also, your dr can schedule a meeting for you with an anestisiologist (sorry, I know that's not spelled right!) to take it over and make a birthing plan- which you should still have and use with a c-section!!!!
