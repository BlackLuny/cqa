WQWA7L5zaa	Someone needs to tell her that that the erection is the phenomenon when the man's penis gets longer and hard and stands up when the man is excited, and the woman's vagina, when she's excited,  gets slippery with mucus to help the penis slide in and out without hurting.otherwise she won't understand how he can put it in.    She also needs to understand that it may sound gross to young people because they have not yet become physically mature to do it. The desire for sex is normally something that goes together with the desire for love and the desire to be a couple and form a family with children. The sex act is how women get pregnant.|`|XmD61yBpaa	yum yum yum yum yum then a bit sticky|`|2BEMSGPdaa	Ask your mommy|`|m43bYTrlaa	when a penis goes into a vagina|`|M2JNgbI1aa	haha, sorry but i can't be the one to answer that|`|eShseKNWaa	um,  When the man's penis ( the thing he pees from)  goes into the girls vagina (where the GIRL pees from)        ^^  but if its your first time it will break through the girls skin, and it will bleed, whatever. :]  lol  um, and how old are you?|`|gvOYEtj5aa	very very good|`|Cd7qujp0aa	The ultimate level of love. Where a girl and a guy start kissing, feeling each other up and cuddling. Then they take off their clothes and continue. Then the male sticks his penis into the girls vagina and if she is a virgin, was born with one and hasn't broke it...rips her hymen. If sperm travels up inside of her and gets far enough...she can become pregnant.
vwcDdNfcaa	sit down and talk to her and if she wont stop call her boss as a "tip" let her get fired and learn even adults make mistakes and need to be reminded but she needs to learn before her stealing progresses    EDIT:    hunny my family is 80,000 in debt and i n.e.v.e.r stold anything in my life wait excuse me i stold a pack of gum when i was 8 but i gave them a quarter the next day due to quilt. if your mother beats you then you shouldnt be in that house hold i dont know if this is a cry for attention but talk to a teacher, friends mother, or an adult you feel you can trust. ive been beaten and sexualy abused before in a foster family i once lived in and it sucked *** and no one believed me because i didnt speak up. ive been raised by plenty of families and thinking my father use to rape me and mother used me as an ash tray you think id have issues but i dont think i have anymore then the normal teenager sometimes life gets hard but that is no right to give up its the idea to work harder to make it better. your mom is doing something "bad" and "bad" people need help, speak up and get her help before she ends up behind bars.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	I hope you have a father somewhere because it's only a matter of time before she is caught no matter how quick she is with her hand. They could suspect her now and be watching her every move. When this happens, she will lose her job and she will not likely be hired again by any company. No company wants to knowingly hire a thief. She may even get some kind of prison sentence if she has stolen enough items and the hospital presses charges against her. Then you will have nowhere to live and will have to go live with your Father. If you don't have a Father, then you will go into some kind of foster care. Just because you are poor doesn't mean your Mom can shoplift. She is a thief.|`|eUUcriANaa	I do not care how poor you are that gives your Mom no right to steal it is wrong. If I was you I would call her work and let them know what is go on secretively. I would also call 911 if she really beat you. Your Mom needs some help and she will not get it unless she gets caught. You need to turn her in and then hopefully you will get adopted by some really wonderful parents.
4WjZTF1saa	have you talked to your husband about how you feel? what about your inlaws? just try talking to them... tell them that you need more space and dont feel its good for your relationship with them or your husband if you see them this often...|`|BGTkTNQyaa	Let me tell you what I did, and why:  My SIL was an evil b!tch to me for over a year, and after she had an affair with my best friend's husband, and we got p!ssed, she lied about the whole thing to her mother and made her think that we were just out to get her. In response, my MIL told my husband that he should be putting them first because marriages come and go. Many other rude and hateful things were said and done, and you know what? To hell with them. Knowing that the $hit was going to hit the fan, I changed my phone number (to preserve my peace) and when rude comments were made to me on my MySpace page, I deleted and blocked the sender (an in-law) and I've stood my ground about the whole thing. You and I are under NO obligation to kiss their patooties....look at it this way: they're no different from the average joe. The only thing that sets them apart is you happened to marry they're sibling/son. Their names are NO WHERE on your marriage license/certificate....you ONLY married him, and HE is where your obligations end as far as they're all concerned. So.....just focus on keeping your distance, not his. Your husband HAS to make up his own mind, because if you limit his exposure---yep! That's right...they'll use it against you, and it may backfire. My husband supports me and always has (he knew his sis was up to no damn good and it pissed him off something fierce when everything else was said/done) so I didn't have to say anything to him...he saw it all for himself. In your situation, you can still apply that. Let him make up his own mind, and keep all the nasty remarks on their side of the fence. Don't join in, ok? Just focus on the life you're building with your husband, and let him hash it out with them in his own way/time. Then later on, you'll have the peace and comfort of knowing that he has no hard feelings towards you. Good luck. I know it's rough ;)|`|uQX1dchPaa	You can only make decisions for yourself not him. You can tell him how you feel but thats about it. Then they are going to exert their right to see the children that sucks I know. My ex in laws threastened to take me to court and now I meet them every few months and hate it and I hate them around my daughter. Ah to wish they would all go away and maby one day they will lose interest until then well they are going to be there and exercise their rights. Just ignore them them see them on a limit basis and get on with your life. If you start a fight your just inviting more of their medling into your life. Go the path of least resistance and try to side step them.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Divorce your husband. Then you won't have to deal with them at all. I don't think you need to worry about their criticisms about you to your husband. You do a nice job of turning him against you anyway by putting him the middle and making him choose between you or his parents.|`|AA12198711	With marriage comes extended family whether you end up liking it or not.     This is something you knew before you married their son.     You accept what you can't change, forgive and move on.|`|eUUcriANaa	I do not think you should they are his parents and if they are doing wrong that is for him to decide not you. You do not have to go visit them, just let him go. It really sounds like you are the jealous one. I hope my son never marries someone like you who tries to rip a family apart. If you don't like them don't deal with them but let him have a relationship with his parents. Remember what goes around comes around.|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	I am in your position also except I don't have children with my partner.  I feel your pain.
utcnajvsaa	My guess is it's legal, but I don't think it was called for.    An icepack might help your swelling, but don't keep it on your face too long. There's probably some kind of ointment or cream you could use, but I'm not sure. Sorry. But I also think if you go to school with that bruise on your face, a teacher might get suspicious and call home.|`|d3b6fdf2d631c2f5712339448db9e43caa	that's child abuse. if this happens alot, you need to call the police. your mom did not do a thing, what a wimp.|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	No he can't do that! It is NEVER okay to hit anybody!  If you went to the police he could get in trouble, BIG trouble for doing this.  To help the bruising...toothpaste.  For your face, an icepack would be good.  I suggest you talk to someone about what happened, because it is Illegal to hit your children/spouse or anyone infact.  Be careful, he will try say he's sorry but he'll eventually do it again, and make sure he isn't abusing your mother!|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	I'm sure that there is more to this story than what you have told us.  You're 15, you made a bad grade and I'm sure you got mouthy with your dad and mom.     Yes, in my opinion parents are allowed to strike their children when it is called for.|`|jnfLQlvXaa	Well... I hav 2 opinions... If the only reason he hit u waz cuz of ur bad grades then he should be really ashamed cuz that i believe is abuse. but if u did get smart with him then he shouldv'e punished u, but not by beating you!|`|ZVNtxUKTaa	NO. He can't hit you in the face.    If you really deserved a hit, then it should have been on the leg or something. Not in the face.|`|GUmZuVFRaa	Thats pretty extreme for C on the report card.   A slap is nothing though, I've been through worse, belt, punch, wooden spoon, whisky bottle smashed on my head, cigarette burn... I was joking about the last two.    It was just a slap not a punch, you'll be fine. For your arm to be bruised you would have purple marks where he grabbed you. If its just red it'll be gone in an hour.|`|22pxRi1Laa	No he shouldnt even if he is yoour father doesnt mean anything.
mp8XgvFDaa	yes. it is very possible you in denile about you two not being together anymore.    first and for most you need to figure out if he really thinks you hate him.  if he does you need to tell him otherwise. dont replace him in your life until you know if he doesn't like you anymore.    if he doesn't want to get back together with you, you just need to move on and find someone else. once you do that look for the qualities in them that are better then your ex's and that should make you happy your not with him anymore.|`|dDSuBQURaa	Demagnetize yourself of your ex and find someone better.|`|1fYdOdJpaa	Well my FReind Soon to be freind!!! YOUh still have feeling for your ex itz obvious that you do Sooo u should just talk to your ex and work something out i hope thiz help--|`|LGAIhRJ1aa	if he cant get out of your head then yes your in denial there is a reason hes there and never know maybe he thinks about you allott and you both just made a bad mistake but also think about why you guys broke up and why he is still on your mind. you cant just get rid of love its there for a reason. =] you love him with all your heart and tell him how you feel. and how you just needed time maybe he misses you and loves you still never know but give it a try it could be worth while.
rx20pKgOaa	I agree also.  Women have only hurt themselves by practicing the "new sexuality" which isn't really new anymore.  But it hurts women in general and especially children that result from these relationships.    I have a friend who is in this situation. The man she has loved for 10 years and has 2 children with won't marry her.  It breaks her heart but she doesn't want to leave him.  He comes and goes when he wants to with little responsibility.  When her youth is gone who will she grow old with?  Who will be there for her?    My heart breaks for her.|`|gGNKMqUNaa	yes man, your grandmother is right  if you have relationship with someone that can fullfill your all physical and mental needs  then there is no need to marry  it ha all advantages and no drawbacks  you are getting all that you will get after marraige and there is no tension that usually comes in marraie life;;  it also relates to a saying  two kills with one shot  ha ha ha   carry on................|`|0AShsMsoaa	to me there is living together when you have already discussed marriage and there is a viable wedding date or thereabouts.  and then there is living together where nothing is said and committed to and the woman, from what i read here every day, is the one out of luck.      from the questions here, it seems like grama was mostly right, that a woman should not lightly just move in with a guy, cause she risks losing her power to inspire him to want to marry her if she is already there.      i dont care who lives together, but i wonder about young women who do this for years on end and then complain that they are not married.  well, by then they are old news.  its a shame.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	It goes both ways...      Why buy the whole pig when all you get is a tiny sausage???|`|LRvjfQyhaa	I can see your point and I agree with you (and your grandma) to an extent.    But I actually think it's a very wise decision to live together before getting married.  I think that once a couple gets engaged, it would be a good idea for them to start living together.  What happens if you get married and buy a house and realize you can't stand to live with each other?  Then you just wasted a ton of money on a wedding that could had been saved if you tested it out beforehand.|`|nZXJrAAjaa	I totally agree with this saying. It seems that nowadays getting married in a church is no longer as important as it is. Seems that people are being more practical now specially when have kids. Couple mostly focus on the expenses with their children rather than have a wedding to make some savings.     We are celebrating our civil marriage  this coming February 15 and both of us decide not to go for church wedding because it cost time and waste of money, but when time comes we have extra cash why not this is a dream of every women, right? To walk down the isle being the prettiest among the ladies during the ceremony.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	I agree with you and your grandma!|`|9d9b8b9e4972c1f3e7d9b9e80936b200aa	It isn't all about sex.  Some guys may make this saying true, but I don't think I do.  I think there is more to marriage, like a house, kids, and you can never forget the tax breaks.  If you really love the girl, it isn't going to matter if she is living with your or not....you will marry her|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Yes i totally agree with you and i think a woman shouldn't move in with a man until she has a wedding ring on her finger.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	This only propagates the stereotype that women are property.    Thanks for taking a steaming dump all over gender equality.    Also, there are a lot of women in this thread that apparently consider themselves to be cows.  Personally, I don't want a cow, I want a woman.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	i think you are right he has no need to marry when he gets all the benefits and none of the draw backs|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Your grandmother sounds very wise.    And yes, men will not marry you and risk half of their fortunes when they don't have to.    Women need to be smart, and wait till they're married before having sex.    And then they should have it as often as they can.    Unfortunately today, women tend to do the opposite....love the boyfriend all the time....never sex up the husband.    So very sad.    Good Luck!|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Personal choice I guess.  But I think if a person is good enough to live together with, then he/she should be good enough to get married with.  If that person is not good enough to get married with, then why sleep with that person?|`|83df363c0b39116bc273bca1cf432436aa	You can't compare cows to people no matter what, so when it comes  to people you better make sure that is the one that you want to live  with for the rest of your life, before getting married, and if it takes living  together to find out , then so be it.|`|kT5Bk0T8aa	sometime it does work,thin on other hand you get what you pay for|`|7cjqT33Baa	I think my husband had a lot of free milk as my boyfriend of many years...but we got married when I finally was ready to.  A man doesn't care so much about the free milk.  He can get free milk all over town.  A man gets serious when he knows there is only one source of milk he wants for life and he doesn't want anyone else drinking his milk.
iZx787ntaa	tbh its nothing to do with kenny  you shouldnt let someone stand in yours and josephs way  but i would talk to kenny about it  ask him if his buddy info was about you  and if it is talk about it  tell him your not out to jeprodise his relationship with joseph  and that you dont, and would never want to ruin his life  just try and sort things out really  see where it leads you  if that fails  try talkin to joseph about it  so he can talk to kenny  just try and figure out a way for him to not feel threatened by you  becoz there is not need.  Good luck!|`|YfTMBFIIaa	This is weird.  You seem like a polite person from how you asked your question.  Maybe he is afraid that you'll take his best friend or something.  All you can do is put up with his immaturity and be as nice and civil as you can to him.  Show him that you aren't evil and threatening.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Talk to Kenny about this and ask him why he hates about you.
nZXJrAAjaa	It depends upon the situation why young women wants divorce. It could be the following;    Infidelity  Communication Breakdown  Physical, Psychological, or Emotional Abuse  Financial Issues  Sexual Incompatibility  Boredom  Religious and Cultural Strains  Child Rearing  Addiction  Differences in Priorities and Expectations|`|CuGAYMlbaa	the whole problem is our culture men are wearing pink coming home and playing PS 3 women have been told they can be both mommy and daddy we through away razors, cell phones, computers we never have enough family's don't even eat dinner together anymore|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Actually, it IS the women who initiate most of the divorces in the US.    And you are quite correct, this behavior of throwing away marriages has been legitamized by too many political and social movements.    It really is a travesty.    Please look at the links provided for my reference sources.|`|Kus73aMQaa	who hold on there buddy. It's not always the woman who asks for the divorce. I agree that people are divorcing younger and younger but the blame doesn't lay just with the woman|`|QCmRRbABaa	Because they know when enough is enough. Because wait longer means waste time. Because women don't need be married forever. Because of men like you.|`|AA10408380	Men also marry for selfish reasons and divorce when those selfish reasons aren't met. It works both ways. I married and now am in the process of divorcing a MALE gold digger. It's rare, but they do exist. Parents shouldn't encourage their sons to enter into a marriage solely for monetary gains. Niranj28- I can see y u don't allow e-mail, many women will bash u for what u've said. Not all women are like what u've described. If men were more understanding and treated women with respect instead of disposable vessels, then divorce wouldn't be happening. Not all dowry cases are false either. Parents didn't marry thier daughter off thinking that her inlaws would keep all her hard earned money and control her and her hubby with it. I hope u'll be a better man when and if u get married.|`|59CaFeS8aa	Divorce couild also be induced by spineless men.    Its up to the individuals to patch up.    If Selection process is faulty, many things can g wrong.    Do not blame girls.    The boys are proving to be James Bonds without remorse.    So, girls, daring ones, choose to be Bond's girl friends.|`|5YFgZCEKaa	hey man..what makes u think that only more and more females ask for divorce...its from both the sides...and whats this selfish motive???with a divorce one home and family breaks and my dear women are home makers not home breakers..in majority of the cases men are at fault and they wont accept it  divorce is the last resort opted by women when nothing else works    why do u want the daughters should be discouraged   why cant people teach their sons to respect and love their wives....  what do u want a husband cheats and wife is discouraged to object or raise voice..people have weird thoughts...u seem to be manuvadi
mp8XgvFDaa	we'll he may not have even noticed you. you need to live life to the fullest and be happy and out there! you need to let people know you for you and the more people who know you the better!    i know a way i get a guys attention i like i casually laugh with one of my friends and "accidentally" bump into the guy i like and just say like oh my gosh im so sorry did i hurt you. and things of that matter.    thats how i met the boy im with right now :P    anyways, you just need to get out there and flirt with him. it may be too late since he asked someone else to the dance but theres other fish in the sea!|`|AHdcLRw6aa	first focus on your education and then you have to love yourself you have to feel pretty no matter what other people may think and things will work out fine.|`|TKY47npcaa	you got to hang out and be "one of the guys" ....  tough if ur not cute|`|hzGBAD0baa	your boobs probably are not big enough.|`|wvdTr3mRaa	I felt the same way at first. The important thing is to not let that get to you. Just because one guy isn't interested in you, it doesn't mean many others aren't. Perhaps you have a secret admirer who hasn't told anyone. In my case, I felt the same way, but I did meet someone eventually that loved me for who I am. He doesn't go to my school, which is a bummer, but it's nice to know there's someone out there who loves me for me. We've been together for six months now. Don't let guys get to you. Be confident and be the very best you can be and sooner or later, you'll meet that special someone. Good luck |`|5z5nagElaa	You might not appear interesting to him|`|hrdChmu9aa	as long as your not hideous most guys unless he is really shallow don't care ha sometimes it just happens and he may just not like u u should talk about ur feelings with him|`|Go830lTeaa	just give him more signs... if his friends sees it they will most likely tell the guy too!!

I believe that if you are comfortable in your love for one another, friendships with the opposite sex should be acceptable.
oEYrC1Wsaa	Do you guys communicate @ all?  If you've had 20 birthday's like this before why is it suddenly an issue?   Yes, I would be P'off if my spouse did this to me.  I would never in a million years do that to him.    I get out of bed when he's on day shift (@ 5.30 am) to make him breakfast & it doesn't have to be his birthday. I make my OH lunches everyday, leave notes in his lunch box etc., even prepare his meals for afternoon shift.    Please talk to her, do you treat her the same?   Perhaps it's time you had a w/end away together just the 2 of you, & rekindle what brought you together in the first place.      Marriage is like a garden you have to tend it lovingly or it will wither & die.|`|plBXp91Daa	No, your not being a wuss i would be upset too if my spouse would do this to me.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Absolutely!

We need new mates!|`|uNehLjVDaa	thats bad sorry x|`|JkvlAVX2aa	If you have been through 20 birthdays like this...and you are still only complaining about it.    Yeah...I have to agree with you that you are a wuss.    For me, I don't rely on anyone celebrating my birthday.  I want something special, I buy it.  I want to do something special, I do it.    If my significant other does not do anything, fine with me because I know that NOT everyone has the habit of celebrating birthdays...and NO ONE should be obligated to celebrate another person's birthday.    Not trying to say that you should NOT appreciate it if someone actually celebrates your birthday.|`|WlywfjG1aa	This is ridiculous. I think any sensible wife would have shown more sense of gratitude and affection. You should discuss this issue with her and tell her that you are hurt.|`|NDEjwn6gaa	i would be p oed|`|wAJbnHGjaa	She would make a perfect guy. Tell her how you feel and see what happens. Be clear and don't beat around the bush. Sometimes people just don't get it unless they're told. You'd be surprised how effective honesty, clarity, and openness can be.|`|Kn0TpDRdaa	Well, that wouldn't make me feel very good. I know this is what everybody will say, but my advice would be to talk to her. Maybe if she understands how you're feeling, she'll put more into the relationship. If you've talked about the problem several times and you still don't feel like she's making the same amount of effort you are, I would suggest counseling. There's obviously something that's not working right if that's the case. Good luck, and happy birthday!|`|7cjqT33Baa	No, I wouldn't be happy with that or tolerate it either.  Birthdays are days where you make the person feel special.  Show effort, put a lot of thought and fun into it.  What is the point of a cake if it's not on the actual day?  We go all out here.  It would break my heart to see my hubby sad on his birthday and it would hurt me if he made me sad on mine.|`|I814g6ZBaa	You can't say the pattern wasn't well established already, Guy.

Anniversary? what you do for her may reflect what she does for you. You may want to take her or make her a nice dinner with flowers and wine. Talk to her about your relationship. Ask if there is anything you could do for her. Take a night and snuggle with her. If she goes to have sex with you tell her you just want to be close to her. that this night is for her her. Tell her you want to start celebrating things better. Send her out to get her hair hands and feet done. If it is within the budget. One day on the spur of the moment take her on a romantic picnic dinner. Do nice things regularly. Most importantly tell her and show her you still love her like yesterday.Then around your birthday drop hints on what you would like to do for your birthday a couple of weeks before. Then let it go and see what happens|`|AA11538662	Maybe she is a bit selfish. Ask her why she does this and maybe do the same for her birthday, I bet she gets the hint then.    Mary in Camden, MI|`|qUmZCJ79aa	No, your not being a wuss. I would expect cake, sex, and presents from my wife on my birthday, and she expects the same from me.  Ask her how she would feel if you treated her like that.|`|3VSjSTE4aa	She sounds a like it or she may not be able to show her affection like she needs to.  It could be worse at least she gave you something. all i got one day was happy Birthday i cheated on you|`|dWLGK7nlaa	Unfortunately since there have been 20 birthdays  like this, why would you expect anything else? It is sad. It is each person's special day and I try to make them feel special.|`|gCklgGBqaa	if i were u.. i will arrange my own big day next time.. and show it to her what i wanted n expected for my birthday.    btw..  how do u celebrate her birthday?  if u treated her birthday as cold.... then maybe...she did that to make u understand how she feel...  but..  if u celebrated hers every year then she should at least personally make u a cake..u are right to feel disappointed and definitely u are not a wuss.|`|AA12261142	i think u are not being a wuss i am sure u do something special for her and i expect the same.|`|f6YsGOynaa	It sounds like she may have at least made some half-baked effort (or not baked in the case of an ice cream cake).  Sometimes, we have to let our partner know what we want or expect from them.  However, if she doesn't know after 20 years that you would like some recognition on your birthday, then she's a completely selfish idiot.      I'm sorry you had a rotten birthday.  You'd think she'd at least even try to put your name on the cake with a 87 cent tube of colored gel from the grocery store.|`|ot8tImmcaa	Yea i think you have a point. It's not you. maybe she does not know how o show affection like that|`|NSKimt1Qaa	No, you're not being a wuss.  You deserve to be shown some special attention on your day.  I grew up in a family that always made it a big deal to make you feel special on your birthday.  My dad always did the same for my mom and my mom for him.  When I got married, I didn't necessarily expect the same thing from my husband, but I expected something.  What I got was nothing.  I was lucky if he remembered to say "Happy Birthday" - no, I take that back, if he said it, it just felt like something he had to get out of the way.  I doubt he really even meant it.  I will say that at least yours is a step up from what I've put up with.  I know that's no much consolation, and she should have done better.  We've both put up with this lack of consideration for 20 years.  You should tell her how you feel and what you would like done differently, if she will listen to you.  Mine knows how I feel, but it doesn't matter.  I decided to just do my own thing, separate from him.  I'm getting to think that way more and more all the time.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Yes, you are a wuss where is the McDonald's questions?
b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	I think that a hairstyle is dependent on what looks best on the person, regardless of the dress. I wore my hair down because I felt most beautiful that way.    Here is a website with some ideas:    http://s20.photobucket.com/albums/b207/b...    The links are on the left.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	Such a pretty dress! it will look good with just about any hairstyle so what you go with depends on what type of headdress or hair ornament you want.   Pick out your veil or tiara and take that with a picture of the dress to your chosen hairstylist and discuss hair with them, my cousin is a hairstylist and shes had to actually pull apart veils to accommodate a hairstyle that a bride has had her heart set on!|`|lgxE5nUoaa	When I got married 3 years ago, I went to a stylist who specialized in doing hair for weddings.  He told me it's always best to have your hair worn up because it's a special occasion and the last thing you want to be doing is worrying about your hair all day long.  My hair is especially fine and straight so there was no way it was going to hold curl for more then a 1/2 hour.  So he styled it up on top of my head and it turned out lovely - the pictures prove it.    I recommend you take a picture of your dress to your stylist and see what they think.  But you can't go wrong wearing it up - it is sophisticated and elegant, and it gives you an instant mini facelift!|`|PfE6bg5iaa	you're dress is beautiful, i love it!    Yes, an updo is definitely good. I recently wore a strapless dress as a bridemaid. Each bridesmaid had a variation of a french twist, with different twists and such. Mine was not a really tight twist... but a little messy and "quirky". I know they took a picture, but the bride (my future sister in law) hasn't gotten them published online yet.
dZxjXHA2aa	There are lots of fun little ways to bond on a deeper level with someone.  The back rubs and talks are an awesome start!!  Start your own mini-book or movie club where you take turns picking a book that you both have to read and then discuss (or a movie to watch together that neither of you would normally go for).  Turn off the TV and go for a long walk or bike ride together once in a while.  Go online and look up those goofy "Getting to know you" surveys and ask eachother the questions out loud, it's amazing all of the stuff you can learn about eachother that way!!|`|Ikd9cppcaa	You can hold hands, talk of the future, make a list of your future plans, save for a home, and just be best friends.

Pre-marital counseling is essential.  If you don't want to spend the gas here are some issues that sincerely need to be covered in a gentle way:    Religion, how you'll raise your children  How many children and when  Expectation on cooking, cleaning  Expecations on maintaining family connections, cards, gifts, who      pays, etc.  How will your money be combined.  Fantasy vacations  How involved do you expect your friends, family, etc. to be in your      lives?  School and career goals.  How many children.  Division of household chores...this seems silly but it's a critical       question.  Big weddling or downpayment on house.    If you are in synch you could weave some powerful dreams and goals.|`|Q7WC6R0saa	Watch a movie, play an old time game.

The fact of the matter is you should already be bonded....that is the reason for marriage and being with someone else.  How can you actually think that you need to start working on bonding and you have already decided to get married.  I am sorry to say this but this is sad.  No stranger or anyone outside of you two should give you ANY type of advice on that!  Bonding is a personal thing, something that happens between two individuals that love each and care unconditionally, pretty much sacred.  I may be a little dramatic when saying this, but it would have to take a divine intervention to seperate two individuals that have truly bonded.  Not mama or Papa or your best friend for the last 3 decades.  Outsiders can never relate or experience the magic that two people have experience that allows them to bond.  You have alot of soul searching to do, seriously speaking.

It is a wonderful gift to give your spouse.    I have been divorced for almost 4 years, and just started a new relationship...the 1st one since my divorce.    You are doing a good job. Be honest in every way.  I tell my boyfriend every day (no, we don't live or sleep together) how happy he makes me, and how lucky I feel to be his girlfriend.  It is not about me being happy...it is about how I can make his world better, I cuddle him and tell him I love him, ask how I can make him comfortable, and just be pleasant all the time, like I actually enjoy seeing him....what a concept.  We have been dating for 2 months, and not one cross word between the two of us.  No reason to fight when you are focusing on the other person and not yourself'.    I hope you have a long and happy relatationship. And by the way, You are more mature and together than most people in deciding to wait, I applaud your self mastery.

Wherever you plan to go in the morning, change those plans. You should go home and take a nap instead. Trust me on this one. You may not get invited to the next party.

I also understand that you have good parents just realize that they really care about you and that is what they feel they must do to protect you. Tell them you understand that they need to know everything you are doing but every now and then you would like to just be alone. That does not mean alone on the computer or alone with someone of the opposite sex or alone with someone else. I think your parents love you enough if you showed them this letter they would understand and back off a bit.
PQBEqS8Caa	No. i dont think its abnormal to want a virgin girl if u r a virgin. U r not shallow for expecting this. But it can depend on how old u r.

So, in the end, you'll just have to accept your lover for who she is.|`|JHasLcn3aa	Well maybe your feeling this way because your nervous about having sex with someone that has already had sex, and you dont want to be compared.    which is completely fine, but if the girl you are with loves you for you,  she will completely understand.    its all about finding the right one...|`|G0U2ExOSaa	no. if you want her to be virgin then don't you do it|`|AN9PdKmgaa	it is normal for 50 years ago good luck even finding a virgin.

I guess it's the fact that you think about her having sex with another guy before you bugs you. Your first time at sex, you give it up to someone you think is true, and perhaps her feelings toward the previous guy bugs you. You're not a jerk for thinking that way.

OjXvYEZDaa	I can understand this problem as it has happened to me as well. She told people about ur secret when she was really drunk, its no excuse for being drunk, she betrayed your trust, if you both really miss each others you can start square 1, slowly trust her again, don't trust her fast, in case she'd do it again. I am not going to forgive my ex best friend it was hardest part to do, its just I am not having her to hurt me again I have moved on for better life. maybe you can trust her ONCE more to make sure she ian't doing it again. A true friend who wouldn't tell anyone your secret|`|u9uFdSrqaa	Just go up to her and start talking and she will eventually listen|`|y3V0R26aaa	for give each other and get on with life!|`|1dNZb7Y4aa	oh jeez.   honestly, idk even what to stay to u.  but really, do u think that this whole "awkward" thing is just a sign to not be friends with her n e more?  idk, that is just a suggestion really.  but maybe u 2 should start by planning on going to a movie together and go from there.  build ur relationship back up.  even if it means talking about the super bowl OR last nights epesoid of american idol.  just build it back up, will take some time but its worth it.   good luck.|`|kjvMZomvaa	Well...... like you I had a friend who said things she promised not to say to anyone but did, i never spoke to here for years as it hurt me badly. Then one night my husband came home an told me she had got a DVT on holiday which i know is a very dangerous thing to get as it is life threatening. I felt really sick as if she had died I know i would of had to of gone to her funeral an i would of cried my heart out as even after all the things that had happened i still had the feelings of the friendship and fun sketched in my heart..... that would never go away as once a friend always a friend :) I went to here house and put a little card through the letter box when i heard she was ill i said i hope you get well soon and that the past was the past, we are best mates now and i love her friendship 100% things gould not get better. learn to forgive........ at least once. Im happy now as i have ever been me an my best mate know that life is for living not hating :) what fun we have.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Sounds like you guys still want to be friends.  Make a date to meet in person and talk over what happened.  She knows she hurt you by telling your secret.  Hopefully by now you can find it in your heart to forgive your friend and hopefully she wants to be forgiven.  Everyone deserves a second chance.|`|AA11523164	if she really is your best friend she probably is really sorry! i would say forgive her just dont forget it
HAk6iROaaa	Divorce is not a bad thing, a lot of divorcees have found better lives after the break, men and women. Divorce is an option, face it, and the sooner Indian understands that it is now becoming part of the culture there, the better.... See, women are now more empowered than before, and so with an independent mind and a fist full of cash, they CAN leave, whereas in the past they couldn't. A working successful woman who is financially independent has NO REASON ON EARTH to put up with an interfering mother in law and a husband that continuously sides with her....|`|61ZtWyqKaa	i think it is because women now have the right to leave without too much of a social stigma     as for mothers of the women I dont think they are to blame to a greater extent it it usually the male (husband) or his family who interfere that is causing this breakdown|`|dwKpjQ8qaa	the problem is India started to mimic american culture.....traditional values and culture is lost..|`|AA10408380	First of all, not only women file for divorce in india. Men do this too. Men also obey their parents in marriage rather than listening to their own hearts. Men also are motivated solely for monetary gains and nothing more. Men also want to drain his wife's family of everything citing that she's his property now, so everything that is hers is his. Men also file for divorce early on in marriages because thier needs aren't met; and blame the woman for the marriage failing. Men's parents also let divorces happen rather than working things out between their DIL and son. MIL's of the girl also interfere with problems,citing that their precious boys cant handle any stress and mustnt do so, so if there is any stress between the couple, the MIL should be involved. Then she turns around and poisons' the relationship, because she wants her son to extract as much cash from wifey  1 so he can obtain wifey  2.    Courts try to be fair and impartial. So they reallize that men and women use each other for monetary gains and things can and do often get ugly. Don't just blame one person. Marriage is a two person thing, and often when more than two are involved and if one or both enter into it for the wrong reasons, marriages fail, and rather than work it out, ppl opt for divorce.|`|59CaFeS8aa	Society cannot do anything.    The younger generation is groomed with platinum spoon in the mouth in molecular families.    They seldom learn the fun and beatuty of sharing, giving and sacrificing.    When they get together, they get fed up too fast and the need for or the art of adjustment do not become handy with them.    Best way is to tear aprt.    and then...?    It will only grow in the times ahead.    Lets be different and lets bring up ouir offsprings to adapt to the high pressure real life situations.    Lets also try bringing up parents.|`|AA10656056	99% GIRLS are responsible for divorce in India at present. 20 years back this is not the situation.  REASONS:  1. Girls are educated, working, independent not obeying husband and elders, take decision to divorce if simple problem arise.  2. They are not adjustable.  3. They only need money, money, car, home, jewels etc not taking care husband.  4. Only need husband for her children name's initial.  5. Now 90% of girls do not know cooking.  6. They only expect husband like bollywood hero, if not, divorce.  7. They only want to marry doctors, engineers, and software engr particularly working USA and settle there. least bother others.  8. Parents blindly support their girl child whatever she do wrong.  9. Girls are earning lot, go to parties, dancing, drinking in pub they think fashion  10. Evading from responsibility to take care husband and his family, raising child, so divorce is option.  11. Falsely accusing as dowry problem and escaping.  12. Accusing husband as he has no manliness and getting divorce.  13. Low level of understanding, respect, adjustment etc      MEN are innocent, loyal, loving, caring, sharing. The opposite gender is not good|`|Y4Pr3s7Jaa	The main reason of increasing divorce in India is high expectations from the partner and one's own self. Nobody want to listen and compromise because they have other alternatives for living life.|`|BfDM12ptaa	i think 2 reasons  1)women needing space from interference(most of the times its good):wives  2)women who cling,cling and cling to their boys even thou they have their life partners(its bad always):moms in law    niranj28, are u married?????is that women still in her senses????
IQXNAxx1aa	ha! im thirteen too and im having the same problem except i never went out with him...............hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm what to do what to do how about..  ASK HER OUT!!! JUST DO IT!!! AND NOT ON THE WEEKEND... DO IT     T O M O R O W!!!!    thanks :)|`|AA11523164	ask her to go to the movies with you with one of your friends who has a gf|`|bKSzuzvRaa	yeah, i agree with the person above.  going to the movies and then maybe dinner is a good idea because you guys don't have to talk much during movies, and then during dinner (not too fancy but not too casual of a restaurant) you guys can talk about the movie.  making it a double date is even better because it's less awkward and you're not forced to talk to her to keep her interested.    hope that helps.
hHSsMyNpaa	Try taking ballet or dance lessons ?  Next time you tell her you won't accept her apology unless its in person and she has to mean it, and do it with a handshake or a friendly hug.  This texting of apologies makes it too easy.    >>> I thought about this some more and maybe she is feeling crowded out, and doesn't know how to be polite about telling you.  She might have problems dealing with you along with her brother (how old is he in relation to you ?) Give your friend some space for a while, let her come back to you after taking a little time out.  Maybe even a few weeks or months.  Hope that makes sense.|`|n53HeORBaa	since you have been friends for life she would and must understand what she has been doing to you, maybe you have remained quiet through all her tirades and she is thinking that this is ok with you so you have to tell her that she is hurting your feelings for she might not be aware, so better tell her than keep it all in, you don't want to let it burst in one angry confrontation now, would you?     just talk to her and tell her directly how you feel then go from there|`|f37A7esiaa	well, down at the bottom, is that one of your friends texts? and just tell her shes mean or whatever you think she is. my friend was really mean and i told her i didnt like her because she was and she stopped being mean. =) hope this helps|`|iZx787ntaa	If she keeps texting you telling you shes sorry  then she is genuinly sorry  have you tried talkin to her   telling her that it happens all the time  and it hurts your feelings everytime and its not something friends should do to one another?  if u keep forgiving her and letting it go  she will keep doing it  as shell think you wont mind  but if you stand up to her and ask her why she does the things shes doing  then maybe things will change.  try avoid falling out with her for good as best you can|`|ZVNtxUKTaa	get ur own sport wut|`|vGHExDOzaa	My friends and i used to have these kids of fights all the time i usally don't talk to them for a day and then they feel really bad and promise not to do it again but they do so i told them one more chance and they blew it so bye bye friends|`|zWEaAFwgaa	if you guys are such good friends, then give her another chance.  If not, then time to move on and get over it.    And what the heck is up with the whole "get your own sport" thing?|`|XKFy1NCraa	She maybe mad at some body else and she just putting all the preasure on you or if shes being a butthole to you all the time i just do'nt know|`|velIdcbNaa	i know what you are going through and it sucks.  What i had to do was just cut her loose.  They will come to their senses and realize what they did.  You have to tell them what is going on and how you feel.  Don't be scared to get your point across, they have to know where you stand.  Then after that walk away and go on with life.  It may take a while.  The same thing happened to me so I know it's kind of weird but you have to do it or risk this happening untill you move away from home.|`|8t2f3W2Yaa	this person doesnt seem like a very good friend , but i dont know the background history between you two , like you said though she has been your friend since you were born so obviously you both care for each other.    maybe she is just going through a bitchy phase or something i dont know , i think the best thing to do is talk to her , ask her why she has said these things and try and sort it out face to face , whatever you do DON'T retaliate or start being mean to her as this could wreck your friendship forever and start a nasty chain of events.
9fc331c0fd7ac7fcec90f1ed63b96b79aa	Take it from a 32 year old. I was much the same way. High School for some is just an awkward stage in life. You really don't know what you will become & none of us really did either. I was shy & feared I would be lonely forever. But the older you get, the more you realize what TOTAL BS high school & all of its "drama" really is. I tell my step daughter all the time that this will pass & it's not life shattering as you think to be uncool. I grew out of it quickly at my 1st job. I found my voice & self. We are NEVER a finished product, so keep growing K?  FYI: I found my wife there too & we've both moved into other fields of work. We've been together for a decade now. And I certainly never would have thought that at your age.|`|hETuKLmqaa	Please understand, at your age you should feel somewhat shy. It's ok to feel that way. Please, focus on school first for now. Be happy, enjoy your friends, they will love you for that. When the time comes, mother nature will find it's way. If mom and dad had a young enjoyable relationship, does it mean we need to do the same. No, but if it comes, that's ok too. Enjoy live, enjoy mom and dad, enjoy friends.    PS. You are cool.
dDSuBQURaa	Hell no with the idea of dating my ex! I don't date best friends. Throw me to the sharks if I do.|`|igkbUflbaa	I would go out with my best friend.  Or you could date me.|`|URLg92cAaa	my best friend but take it slow|`|ZllkWRIOaa	neither|`|OBuzcIDbaa	I think you know the answer to this question, but are needing confirmation. Of course it should be your best friend. Don't go backwards. Go forwards. If he cheated once, he'll cheat again.|`|pNJuKZtSaa	Someone you love whould be your best friend, be it your husband, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, kids or family.     Who do you want to go with?|`|l22Neymmaa	2nd option.. as long as they are opposite sex...|`|C9BctAMQaa	The 2nd one obviously lol|`|mylSr6AAaa	best friend, that wasnt too hard haha|`|DeObHL9Oaa	I would do totally go out with my best friend who IIIIII am like in LOVE with  =*]|`|eeaZH31yaa	go out with your best friend!|`|gLmVboNkaa	the 2nd one|`|zH4s97yVaa	The one who you love more.
N7mgfDxnaa	he's a dj, he works at a bar.. maybe he was impatient and took care of himself. but if he's not looking you in the eye or being short about it, i wouldn't cancel it out. girls at bars are usually wasted, and going for a performer, or anyone really. but if you were at a bar would you go for any average drunk guy in the bar, or the hot dj?|`|Ikd9cppcaa	I've found that if you think a guy is cheating, they are cheating. The only exception would be is if you are the jealous type and looking for signs all the time. In this case, YES.|`|mefxIQP9aa	No, not really. I mean, you don't just come home smelling like rubber, especially since this is routine for him to have a night like this(dj-ing and all).    And bars do get pretty wild after midnight and lots of sluts are at bars. I would be a tad bit worried.    Btw, how long does it take for him to get to your house? If it's later than the usual time(and I don't mean exactly one minute late), he most likely got some.|`|BWPtZkIDaa	nooo u r not wrong...  also if got off at 1 & didnt get 2 ur house until 2  he mite have cheated  srry.....|`|uFJXz1x3aa	nooo its ok that u thought that...its like finding blood on him , and hes holding a knife, obviously your gonna think he killed someone! lol......but yeah, its ok as long as you had reason to suspect it..maybe u should talk about it with him?|`|dcLQAdhLaa	no your not wrong.. especially if you have been cheated on before.. but i would advise talking to him more about it.. dont always just assume the worst. if you have been together for a long time and you have a lot of trust in one another then i doubt he did but you never know..bring it up to him in a conversation just casually and if he says he didnt and he seems like hes telling the truth then maybe he isnt lying.|`|wvdTr3mRaa	A relationship is based on trust. Do you really trust him? If his answer, is enough to let you forget about it, then you just have to move on. If he's said no and he seems to be truthful maybe he is telling the truth? Let it slide for now, and if it happens again, confront him. If he still says claims he's not, see if his attitude is somehow changing. An attitude change could reflect guilt. Good luck though |`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	Sounds suspicious to me|`|HtZBATJNaa	2 possibilities     1- your either paranoid. or  2- a woman's instinct is always right.|`|0afWMIoKaa	This is obviously going to be on your mind like forever. You have to decide right now whether you thought he did or not. In my opinion, he probably didnt. Even if he did, why the hell would he smell like a condom? Unless you rub it all over yourself, you are not going to smell like condom.|`|LGAIhRJ1aa	so you trust him? trust is the key. if you don't trust him then maybe you both should sit and talk about it together hopefully he will open up and tell you the truth but don't go right to conclusion first ask him if he has ever cheated on you then if he asks why be like well because ..... and tell your story.|`|KACY7vGGaa	he could have masturbated but IDK that is a toughie psychology says to always go with your gut instinct so you know him better so he must have cheated.|`|14e3f62e4aadac6dc3e97d2ea1b5e895aa	My motto is to never have sex with any man that you are  not ABSOLUTELY sure is having sex with YOU ONLY!!!   I do believe that it is not out of line to request an HIV  test and STD test prior to ANY INTERCOURSE.    Men think that when they use a condom they don't need to take precautions....NOT!!!|`|YZGLhYGMaa	you are not wrong for protecting yourself!! i cant honestly say if he did or not cheat. I am sorry that you are going through this and there will never be away to tell if he really did or not unless he comes clean or you make him take a lie detector test. I think that you are smart for being true to yourself and asking. I wouldnt feel regret but i would watch everything you do and he does from here on out thats for damn sure!|`|PCBQbQmraa	Well you can tell if a guy recently had sex by how hard his penis was. Haha i get my boyfriend all the time if its a little soft then that mines he been jerking off, and it never fails because i ask my boyfriend if he played with him and he always tells me the truth =]. and if its softer then soft then it was that day. Little soft means a couple of days ago.|`|sguuvblFaa	NOT AT ALL GO WITH YOUR INSTINCTS BUT IF HE DID HAVE SEX BEFORE HE CAME I DONT THINK HE WOULD WANT TO AGAIN UNLESS HES LIKE A SEX FREAK YA KNOW?? WELL GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING HOPE EVERYTHING WORKS OUT|`|6MMqlCfuaa	Your instincts are saying Yes.  Trust them, you know something was not right.  Confront him about it.|`|nRuEaqm5aa	girl, idk wattu in but dat dude is dfinatley cheating on u , if he comes home at least 1 and a half hours late and the time used to get in teh car and drive home and put everything bak, then it hsud tae somewhat arund 30 minutes. wats left.... 1 hour for him to CHEAT ON U. iim a guy and i cheated on my girl and that same exact thing so i want to let u know that he def. is cheating on u and i regret wat i did|`|UCO7blmKaa	no. most likely your guts are right! us girls always feel when something is wrong.. or when something is going on, trust your guts! im gonna say he cheated on you.  why else would he smell like latex?|`|cPpP4BZIaa	hehehe, he smelled like latex wow... If he was willing to have sex with you . I would say he didn't cheat. But then again, I don't know your history together.|`|cqOOKv3Jaa	no girl, you're not wrong for thinking that. your just following youre natural female instincts. now these instincts could be wrong, but sex DOES have a distinct smell and if you are sure if what you sense, then yes he probably did have sex. However, since you aren't sure i would just observe him and his behaviors over the next few weeks. see if anything is different about his whereabouts, if regular routines have changed, etc. Trust me a girl always knows when her man is cheating.     Good Luck.!|`|3VSjSTE4aa	If you think that he cheated then go with it.  Most of the time if you think the person cheated they have.  But if you really trust him then just take him at his word.  In my opion it sounds a little fishy just think about it and don't make any rash moves on it just yet|`|CzPL5108aa	well the fact that u would so readily accuse him could resemble a lack of trust...and in that case it doesn't really matter if he cheated on u or not. u shouldn't be with someone u can't 100% trust. but he did call u..if he was gonna cheat on you i doubt he would call you....more than once. but if it didn't feel right, then maybe u should go with your gut and believe he did cheat on you
NEw5dsJlaa	At that age, you get a flood of hormones no matter what nationality you are. If it materializes in having a lot of sex, it could be a lot of factors. She could be seeking intimacy with men, or she could be just plain bored. I'd suggest getting her into activities that she enjoys, 17 is not too late to pick up a sport like dancing or soccer, which will engage her body and mind in a more healthy and safe way as well as being a social activity.|`|d08rkYlpaa	Developing your sexuality is an important part of becoming an adult. All kids go through a phase of being sex-obsessed, it is normal, and human. We tend to forget that after we emerge somewhat from the hormone-induced haze we all go through as teens, because it's mostly subconscious desires that drive us.  Different nationalities and societies handle this teen phase of development differently. Some are very strict, repressive and punitive - if a girl has sex before marriage she might be stoned to death, or have to wear a scarlet letter.   Others are more lenient, hoping that kids will get enough information about sex to act responsibly without the threat of punishment to keep them in line.  Germany falls between the two extremes, as do most developed countries, and do not have more that a loose national policy on teen sex. Other countries are much more permissive than Germany - the Netherlands, for example, Sweden, France, and some parts of the USA. So you can't really blame it on Germany.  Just make sure she knows enough information about sex and relationships so that she can start to make some responsible decisions once the hormone fog clears from her brain a little bit.
AA12198711	They are not going to look for him over a speeding ticket.     Best for you to not consider him a boyfriend right now. Tread lightly.|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	you obviously don't know your boyfriend do you...|`|FhHkT0bBaa	No sweetie,they dont,are you sure you know all your bf is up too?|`|gt3LdZGBaa	no a police officer would not do that. mabe he did something wrong that you dnt knw about.|`|cer6YWt9aa	In most places you can have an NCIC-National Crime Inventory Computer check. All you need is his REAL name and his date of birth. Often times you can go to the main station of the local police. Some areas have an NCIC office you can go to. It may cost 15.00 for the first page and 10.00 for each additional page. I wouldn't let them know what I'm was up to, but, it sounds like you should find out whats going on. If  you  don't want to get that drastic you can try getting ahold of your local police non-emergency or records department and asking. You will probibly need at least his full name and date of birth. His social security number will definately help. Do be careful-you do not know for sure who you are dealing with.  Best of luck.....|`|WyCmQBuvaa	He did something wrong.
NEw5dsJlaa	The best gifts are personal and will mean something just between the two of you. Like.. instead of getting a regular Nintendo DS, get one preloaded with her favorite game and engraved or painted with her initials. Or give an MP3 player filled with your favorite songs to listen to together (that's what I got my BF for xmas hehe). If you can afford it, vacations are a great gift and strengthen the relationship for sure. Good luck!|`|rAeJ74Neaa	how much u wanting to spend on her?   u could get her jewelery every girl likes it :)   or some new perfume?   u could take her out for a meal?   flowers ?   bit of everything haha :)   x x
OwLckUE5aa	haha. duct tape, and sharpies, my friend, duct tape and sharpies.=]|`|AA12109238	give it to her anyways. tell her she can do wat she wants with it and that u have no reason to keep it cuz it was for her.|`|ElRyvoWbaa	Give it to your best girl bud or lil sis or a baby or just keep it.    or give it to your new girlfriend.|`|hCSLPz9Uaa	KILL IT!!!!|`|Go830lTeaa	give it to the firehouse to give little kids who was in a tradegy, those little kids gets really happy!!!!! do a good thing
HH90Eghaaa	Never point out your flaws to your boyfriend!  People like confidence and not a whinny girl that tells then oh I'm fat, blah blah blah!  After while it gets really annoying, trust me. If you don't like something about you fix it, don;t just complain! Anyways if you must do that, do it with your girlfriends, not your partner! Confidence is sexy!|`|A7nIADxgaa	wear a mini skirt    that was obvious :)    just joking, seriously, tell him how you feel about it    and never tell your boyfriend you think your fat and want to lose weight. Like you saw from his answer, he wasn't even listening to you. This is the thing that is completely boring them out.|`|Q7WC6R0saa	ugh. boys, tell him how that made you feel i know that's like not cool an all but that will give him a better understanding how he should act when ur around. and if you are going to lose the weight, do it natural. you and him should go to the gym together or something. don't like start puking after every meal. that actually makes you gain weight believe it or not!|`|wvdTr3mRaa	Boys. They always do this. Tell him how you feel. If he's still acting like a jerk, tell him you need to take some time off and do something to forget about it. When you feel like talking to him again, go for it and explain once again how much that hurt you. Good luck |`|DIj072Sqaa	This sounds like an 'eyes may wonder' situation. I think it's enough to give an evil look - if you're a teacher or a parent you know the one I mean. You should talk to him about this and don't let him be dismissive or cold, make it clear that it's something that is important to you but at the same time don't think that you can change or control someone else's natural instincts.|`|cJ2lbt7oaa	I know how you feel about the whole weight thing, girl. I am so with you. I hate to say it, but a lot of guys are pretty impassive about things that make a girl want to jump in front of a car. If you and me gain ten pounds, it's veggies and BunBusters till we ache. For guys, it's like, ok, so what? The upside to them being so oblivious to our troubles is that at least you know he's not all that concerned with how you look. On the other hand, him saying that about that chick in front of you was far from okay.   You could be the bigger person and just ask him to keep his thoughts about other girls to himself, OR.....you could take a sip of sweet revenge the next time a tan cutie with big arms and a tight *** walks by and say, "DAYUM, boy you is FINE!" See what he says about THAT!|`|8SyUHkPXaa	You are insecure.  You're not ready for relationships at your age.|`|P3TwooCBaa	Tell him to stop that.  now answer my Qs :)|`|LeiF941naa	he's a jerk you should dump him!
1Z0Lmrk1aa	It could be a subconscious desire or your just acting out your true feelings for the guy?

x6UJe8jkaa	Do not go on his turf. Both take vacation time and meet somewhere on neutral ground for a few days to see how it works at first.  DO NOT QUIT YOUR JOB!!  I have never seen these situations work out well in the past.|`|0AShsMsoaa	have you ever read the book 'the rules?'  not to take it word for word, but, the tone of the book is:  respect yourself and you wont have trouble with men.    if you suspect he would love for you to come see him and have a good time with him, what is wrong with that?  first, know that for him this is just a fling. nothing more.  if he was serious about seeing you, he would come see you, or, he would pay for your whole ticket. and if you stay with him and arent comfortable, well, that is indeed a disaster.     a better thought would be for him to visit you. and/or pay your whole way.  put your feelings into something? why on earth are you putting your feelings into this?  just go with the flow and have fun!  it is your right to have fun!  chill out.  it is just a date.  nothing more. if you know this upfront, you wont worry about feelings getting hurt.     be more sure of yourself, more independent of others whims, and you will attract the kind of guy who will respect the respect  you have for yourself.      and here is one more thing. he is geographically unavailable.  so, unless you want the hassle of a long distance stupid go nowhere friendship, just enjoy the moment with him when you see him and let it go at that.|`|CGJ68TIXaa	if he lives by himself and has good job than its preaty good. you should visit him if you have a crush and a chance to visit him. but watch out because many guys with nice jobs and who live by their self use girls just to have fun. because when youre young you have fun and thats many of us do. so its realy up to you. trust him and visit. or save yourself for someone else.

dZxjXHA2aa	That's a really tough situation!  First of all, he's very lucky you are there to listen to him and that's the main thing he needs is a shoulder to lean on!!  I'd tell him this: it's really good his dad stopped drinking!!  When his dad starts he should walk away.  Don't antagonize him or get his dad started on his case for any other reason.  Remember he shouldn' t have to earn his dad's love or respect so just walk away and don't take what he says to heart.  One day when they're not arguing and things are calm, he should ask his dad to sit down and talk.  Tell him I wish we were closer but I'm not sure what you need from me as a son and here's what I'm asking you to do as my dad.  If things don't change he should CALMLY let his dad know that it is sad because he's going to create a bigger rift between them that they may not be able to tackle.  If still no luck, does he have any other family members who could maybe talk to his dad on his behalf or at least give him somewhere to go when it gets too heated at home.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	How old are each of you?    Where is "bf's" mother?    I would be very cautious about a serious relationship with "bf".    If he resents having to do chores in father's home (in which he probably lives free), he will NEVER make a good husband and/or father.
ZRYZvcgNaa	Sometimes when girls like someone they tend to take the most little thing and make it in to seeming as though he likes you  I say  Chill  He's just being nice  i know a lot of people who act like that  some guys act like that around all girls  trying to make u laugh is not a sign of like, its just being friendly  chill|`|8G1eYEsZaa	get a close friend to ask or you can|`|URLg92cAaa	you never know if he likes you but you should ask the worse possible thing he could say is no|`|W9pfAhx6aa	http://tinyurl.com/davg4q|`|bxqwIjyeaa	yeah girl. he's into you|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	No he doesn't.|`|mp8XgvFDaa	it seems like he likes you, but he doesn't want to.  since he's a grade above he might think that his friends would make fun of him for being with a grade younger.  you just need to flirt with him & if you do like him asking his bestfriend for a hug is a big no no. you need to ask the guy you LIKE for a hug before his best friend.  that could make him seem like you don't like him or that your just easy which is not attractive to some guys.    just flirt with him and hold his arm while your walking together and stuff.|`|zW67wcRVaa	He could.  You should ask him if he does.|`|pRe3OZegaa	I think he could definitely like you, but it's better to be a little cautious.  Become closer friends with him first, and see where your relationship goes from there.  These are all signs that he's probably into you, but if he has a girlfriend it's probably best not to get involved at the moment.  Try to get to know him better, and hopefully things will go from there.  And if you want to get him a Valentine's Day present, by all means go for it! :)     Good Luck!|`|l82yIgeFaa	That all sounds so adorable=)  go for it.   he sounds interested, to me.     Good luck, girlee!|`|P3TwooCBaa	yes he could  now answer mine|`|T1pp4u0Naa	he definetly likes you and you should get him a gift! That lets him know you were thinking about him and i bet he'll give you a gift in return!
I2wPn0Zlaa	It works great! All fun no strings. But...you cant let your feelings get involved|`|dCmSA6r2aa	doesn't work   either the girl forms emotional attactment  or the guy forms physical ones and gets jealous of the girl and anyone showing her attention|`|h9uGsFfTaa	I think it's wrong.|`|DFw8TSmMaa	It's a really realllyyyyy sticky situation to be in. I personally don't recommend it after being in a couple FWB situations. Odds are that one person doesn't get the 'friends' part of it, and that can cause jealousy and problems especially when the other person develops a romantic interest in someone else. The friendship will go down hill. Don't do it. While the benefits are great, someone will develop feelings and then it's **** from there on.|`|0W6lIfYVaa	being in one of those situations right now i don't recommend it. it probably just ruined the best friendship i have ever had and its always going to hurt one of the people involved.|`|AA10743159	I would suspect it really depends, on what kind of friends you are, or were. Did you have a close relationship, but for one reason or another, could see that it wouldn't work out between the two of you. Yet you still cared for each other. If you were having sex on a regular basis, and lets say not having much luck back in the dating pool, and both of you, decided to have sex, while you found the right one, then that's a good way to go.  But the problem with that is, that it keeps you tied together, and less willing to break a bond, between you and find that right one for each of you.   We all have sexual desires, and that drive, often makes us, get out of the house and find that mate, so having no strings attached sex, can stop of delay, that urge.  As long as you both know, what you are doing and are fine with it, and are out there looking for a new mate, and know that the sex, is just temporary, then I say go for it.|`|aNqKp5vraa	um...im not really sure, but i think it will wind up ruining friendships and make things awkward when things change for one person or the other.
dZxjXHA2aa	If you had a little girl would you let her ever be alone with your dad? NO Would you go straight to the authorities no matter what if he hurt her? YES  Your family should have reacted, your dad SHOULD be in jail, and you need to distance yourself as much as possible.  Please confide in your doctor and ask him/her for a recommendation of someone to speak with.  You've lived with all of this alone for long enough!!|`|rvoo4rBjaa	The past is the past leave it there. I grew up with similar situation and I found that you can't live your future by your past.What is done is done- you can't change it- it was wrong he knows it to and he has to live with it. You did nothing wrong --- HE DID and Your family did by not doing anything about it.For some reason everyone thinks if they don't talk about things i will be forgotten and go away. But as I said the past is gone your future well being is up to you--- it is your choice to let it go or dwell on it and ruin your future?? He is the one that has to answer to God in the end not you.Go on with your life happy and free of his wrong doing.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	your family handled it wrong sorry hon but its true  as for you hon get some counseling so you can put it behind you|`|XYPpEJLiaa	Call a hotline; or the police; or something ya know? That's disgusting and completely unacceptable. You need to tell someone who will do something. Good luck and I hope you take my advice.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	You need to report this b*stard (sorry) but I have been there but it was my stupid Uncle who molested me and raped me (he broke in, when my parents were at work and I was 14 at the time) he is now in jail for a very long time with no parole and before that he was molesting other young girls, touching and etc. Your dad needs to be locked up before he hurts another child or becomes a pedafile. I can go on and on but you need to protect yourself and think of all those innocent kids out there. He cant do anything to you. It was NOT your fault Sweetie, he is a sick sick b*stard. Dont be scared, go put his sorry azz in prison.    Good Luck Honey :o)|`|812acd570608b909be2a850fb734a285aa	All the scenarios definitely count as molestation. Statements like "I know this sounds dumb" worry me, because they don't sound dumb. I know your family ignored you, but you need to work out how you feel about him even to this day. The issue isn't resolved. Your family will want to believe it's not bad (because they are embarrassed to talk about it) and want to forgive him, but they are failing to care about you, his victim. YOU have to speak up and make it his problem again. Man, I don't know what to say about your situation...I feel sorry that he disappointed you like that, but it's not okay. He crossed the line regardless of his role in your family. Don't see him as just your dad, see him as someone who is sick and gave you the wrong impression of the world. Love is earned, not automatically given to people who take certain roles. And your father is damaging your concept of love. Don't let him be sick for the rest of his life and hurt others. Sometimes the lessons of love are tough, but it's him that deserves a prison and not you.|`|LbGRsCTKaa	You need a counselor.      Find one and go.|`|aWvuZJjRaa	yes, he molested you. sorry to say that. it wasnt extream. and if he only did it a couple times then......... oh well. and your family prolly doesnt bring it up because they dont want to mention it incase you get uspet. or they could be afraid. and do you WANT you dad in jail!? no. so neiether did they. and plus he hasnt done it since, so thats cool i guess.|`|xAibdGsTaa	do not forgive him and worry about it do somehting good luck|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	Your family is dead wrong. I am shocked but not sure when this happened. Yes he should have been put in jail. but his brothers must have saved him. i think that they watched him from that time on and that is why nothing else happened. But they were wrong to not say something but then again they are sorry people. its up to you if you can forgive and move on. its very sad that you had to go through tis and yes this is molestation. its horrible what he did to you. I am sure they must have watched him like a hawk with you areound but not sure either. i mean sometimes people will do stuff back in the day and nothign is done. but i would decide for yourself can you still care about him you know you can't ever leave your kids when you have them with him. hes a known pervert and molester and you know it. if he does this to your kids what wooudl you do i would put him in jail for the duration of his life.  its still hes doing thing but the grandma knows what is up and shes tryign to warn you not to be alone with him ever again. Get a therapits and have a few sessions and make sure you are ok. I realize how old you are and you know what? if he so much as looks funny at you turn him in and don't look the other way he needs to get his regardless of what the stupid family ofyours thinks show this to your grandma and tell her shame on her. shes horribel for not getting him.|`|v1jY3onRaa	dont ever forgive him and dont let this mess up your life.he is not a father of any kind to keep in your heart.and if you want to get even bring it up everytime he thinks he is being a father to you and remind him how theres no love of any kind for a man that does that to his own child.dont be the victim be the poison that will eat at his heart.....|`|xrLE3Ytgaa	Look, you have every right to feel awkward around your dad after what he just did to you in the past. And it's very common for you to still love him because he's your farther.                    I have two friends who have been abused in the worst possible ways by they're Fathers. Now them and they're mothers have restraining orders against them. But both of these friends not only still love but feel sorry and miss them. To me that's a common thing because I have a mother who has abused my mentally many times and only ounce psychically and I still love her.                     And yes your family should have done more for you and your farther. Maybe your right and your Uncles were embarrassed of what your farther did. Or maybe it was something else you didn't know about that was going on and they're keeping it a secret.                       My best advise is to talk about it, you can't keep it in forever. Talk it over with your mom, uncles, or maybe your grandmother. It may or will seem like they don't want to hear it over or deal with it over again but you got to tell them that you need to.
wvdTr3mRaa	LOL, don't worry about it. She's probably just occupied. I know usually when i'm really busy I don't check my phone for a few days. You could also seem a bit desperate to her. Try not to. Wait for three days and if she doesn't reply back maybe move on or try another tactic like talking to her in person. Good luck |`|CdDM0Xtaaa	I don't think you are a fool in love maybe she just has other things to do. Before she talks to you that's all don't get yourself all stressed out over a girl there is a lot of other girls out there.|`|R5mmX9Woaa	Hate to say this, but she may not be real interested in you. Or she could be scared of rejection.     Best of Luck, Hope this helps!    P.S: If anyone wants to help me please answer my last question.      P.S:|`|cDz6jxxnaa	lol don't worry, you don't want to seem too desperate. She probably just had her phone turned off or was busy.|`|PSZEw34Kaa	mabey she doesnt use her phone alot...i know this girl whos never on facebook, and then replies to EVERYTHING on one speacial day..  bro, TALK TO HER PERSONALLY...  dont mind behind technology bro, shell respect that :)    gud luck|`|5ciDai7Paa	You're not a fool, she probably is just busy or lost her phone I'm kind of a ditz so that happens to me alot.|`|6sAOBn4maa	Haha. I know how you feel. Well, just talk to her and ask her what's up =) see if she's busy and stuff. It's cute though. =) I'm sure she likes you back. =) Just keep talking to her. I wish you the very best of luck.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Give her a couple of more hours. Maybe she's busy.|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	Maybe she really don't want to talk to you. Ignoring someone is easier than telling the truth sometimes.|`|bxqwIjyeaa	if you keep pursuing her like that she wont like it man. i know its hard, but give her some space and things will fall into place. switch it up on her. try not texting her, and when she finally texts you, dont even answer it man. just act like you never got it and think of something else. like how good your neighbor would look in a bathing suit. or better yet, in nothing. in your bed.|`|vY1FaXwNaa	um calm down if she answers she answers no girl likes a clingy boyfriend|`|e28P8gWraa	You sound like your being too clingy, how about you slow down a bit before she drops you.|`|pvosPN40aa	Calm down and dont over think things. The worst thing you could do to a girl is come on too strong. Dont text or call her again. Wait for her to call or text you. Does she like you back? Remember sometimes a cigar is just a cigar|`|LPilzLnZaa	she might just be busy or not wana talk right now...  just send her a message and be like  "y are you mad at me? your making me sad!!!"   lol works alot... at least it does for me =)|`|V11l2Yk2aa	She might be busy... you cant expect her to always have her cell phone...|`|RBGc1Hytaa	She's probably playing hard to get. She probably WANTS to respond to all of your texts but is playing the game. Eventually she'll cave and text you back. Girls are weird like that.|`|HkyOtIeTaa	she's probably playing hard to get.  she probably wants you talk to her face to face more often instead of texting.|`|rJCf2Td4aa	Just bown her in front of all of your friends and family|`|ZRYZvcgNaa	maybe her phones dead  when mines dead  sometimes it takes me a week to charge it|`|kVyCrVyHaa	maybe she doesnt like u. u should talk to her in person. be straight forward and ask her whats up. if she doesnt like u she'll tell u. but if she does, she'll be happy u care to know. good luck ;)|`|nXGMZerxaa	The best thing you  could do is give her her space. A girl doesn't like a guy that won't leave her alone. Maybe only text her every other day, or wait for her to text you. When you do finally start talking, ask her if she wants to hang out. Not as a date (yet) but just to show her what you're like and show her your best qualities.|`|li07DuSGaa	aww hon,       If she liked you she'd be sending you twice as many texts as ur sending her. I've been there... i txted him 5 times as much as he did. She obviously doesn't care enough to even text you back.. but theres always another reason... maybe she is poor and can;t offord it or something..  anyway, good luck baby! lol im calling everyone that todayy hahah|`|geL6jbdpaa	she is busy probably but if she is doing this all the time its time to move on sorry|`|0LHXNXVfaa	Whoa, is she like hot/cold. Those girls are hard to get, most of the time they're prob messing with ut mind but sometimes they can be ignoring u cuz they don't think any better of you lol no offense okay? And what u should do im not sure. :)|`|iNzRRI70aa	Just talk to her it will make things easier dont just text her V day is coming up so do something special.      LuCkY|`|EmUhDWxZaa	well,me,personally being a girl maybe u shud txt her til u convince her u love er cuz girlz hav 2 much pride:)
5DJzp6bMaa	Yes to most Guys Sex is Sex|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Who the hell cares if he loves her or not leave the creep.|`|yChNsa85aa	so i suppose the appropriate thing to do is dismiss your husband thats DISGUSTING. eww a mistress wow.. even if he didn't fall in love with her he's been cheating with a semi prostitute for 3 years, obviously there is something at fault in your relationship..|`|dCmSA6r2aa	guys can but girls tend to develop the attactment  but the fact that he didn't cut it off says there is something there|`|207dFmdHaa	sorry but I would have to leave him, trust is a big issue with me.....he is not going to stop seeing hookers, and the money he spent would piss me off, he could of spent that money on me or my kids|`|epQXDf9Kaa	Your husband is frightening, this girl doens t know what she his doing, he is taking advantage of her circumstances and he is 2o years older..what a shame, ugly soul he has|`|cLfIJgudaa	ok why does that matter?! you should NOT be staying with a man that cheated on you for 3 years!! Who gives a crap whether or not he loves her!!|`|THWHHHRWaa	and you are staying with him? he will get back with her, mark it in your book. get out, fast!|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	I think you know the answer. 3 years together! What kind of relationship did you have with him after 3 years! I think you need to open your eyes honey, this "man" is a typical cheater and is saying things to make you some how feel better about it all. I don't believe in cheating at all and would leave his azz.|`|BjYn8Aeeaa	Of course someone can have an affair and not fall in love. Affairs are usually about sex which for me does not equal love.|`|tcyuTHjPaa	He loves you,just change your sex life with him!|`|39SPqvhyaa	it shouldn't matter whether it was for sex, money or any other lame excuse he might come up with. "its not right". he wants his cake and eat it too.  no, there isn't anything keeping him from falling in love with this woman, he's been with her for 3 years and apparently she's everything he wants, "he's a king when he's with her". anybody else would be glad to pay her just to keep her. don't let this jerk fool you or blame you. this is his problem. and it will probably happen again and again as long as you allow it.|`|Whd6tqLzaa	A mistress for 3 years means he was having a full blown affair. Even he didn't love her but loved to have sex with her, which is cheating. Now that you know it, I hope you have kicked him out of the house. Let him find a cheaper whore, who would satisfy all his sexual fantasies.    My husband had an affair for more than 3 yrs, he denied any relationship, physical or emotional, with her but I have found proof that they were deeply engaged in both physically and emotionally. Kicked him out of the house. He was so insensitive of his wife who took care of him, his children and the whole family and shared all the financial expenses. I can't tolerate his selfish behavior anymore and told him that he can go to his mistress, he has no place in my house or heart. You should do the same. He should learn his lesson.|`|c9cc6397b90545899154ba1a811d28caaa	honestly after 3 yrs their is something their for him to keep coming back! please analyze the situation before going back if that's what you choose to do, Good luck

JX6X19yPaa	then wait for him to ask you, its tradition|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	No, I don't think you should ask him again.     He knows how you feel.    I think you should dump him, and go and find someone else.|`|2k2ZeUwkaa	Personally i dont think you should waste your time asking him again-HE SAID NO 3 TIMES- that alone tells you what your answer is going to be.why does he keep saying no? maybe you should sit him down and ask him what the reasons are. Maybe he doesnt want to get married at all, but doesnt want to tell you and hurt your feelings? If he wanted to marry you, dont you think he would have asked you by now? If you do decide to ask him again, i hope he says yes. If he says no, then maybe its time to have a real heart to heart and get your answers.|`|sLEoWYr5aa	Did you consider the fact he may not want to marry? You need to speak with him and find out what puts him off marriage, just because he says no doesn't mean he doesn't love you.|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Depends what the reasons are for him not wanting to marry you.|`|HtZBATJNaa	WELL that would be not a valentine but a nightmare for him since he clearly doesn't wana get marrid. why do you put so much pressure on him. let him be the one who ask you not the other way round.    believe guys hate being pressurized. if he doesn't wana get marrid it doesnt mean he dosnt love you. just give it time.|`|8G5oT4YFaa	you gotta be patient.. dont ruin valentines day with the stupid question.. you should talk to him about it.. and just let things unfold! and then he will eventually do it im sure|`|5J8OZAJFaa	well, it's a matter of opinion, if love is related to marriage. I would take it this way, yes. But there's also a possibility that he doesn't wanna get married, so don't nag on him|`|NWwKrrC3aa	Find out why he said no!?

CXh6Seigaa	I'm a lot like that. She's probably kind of a shy person in one-on-one situations. They're totally extroverted in groups, but the don't speak to others unless they talk to them first because they don't think they want to be bothered with them.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	maybe she doesnt want people to start talking... we all know how peopl can be :/|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	well maybe she feels more comfortable when she's outside of school?? or...theres no time to talk in the hallways and she's gonna be late to her next class...|`|hko5rrVoaa	She's shy and has little confidence. I'm like that too. It's because in a crowd everybody is listening(most likely) and in private well no ones their but you and her.|`|8AHUuhbvaa	yeah i have kinda the same issue and i'm wondering that also, a guy talks to me on facebook and leaves me messages but doesn't talk in person lol.
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	You need to talk to your parents or a school counselor...|`|rAeJ74Neaa	how old are you? and to be honest its something that you need to firgure on your own, no one can tell you what u can and cannot do if you want to keep the baby then do so and im glad ur against abortion in that way, would you feel any better if you knew ur dad was happy about it all? i think if the answer is yes then you know its your dad thats gettin you down at the same time of the shock that you are pregnant|`|LOgGGuRqaa	if ur not yet an adult, i think the best choice for u is to have an abortion cuz a baby will take up most of ur life...im not saying ull regret it but i think u should enjoy ur young years|`|4pS8KDFbaa	call a crisis pregnancy number,  they are great help,  some even house the mother to be and present different options  :)|`|wuBIF9aPaa	Forget what the "dad" says.   it is your decision and your decision alone.    the boy  (man) who got you pregnant can't even use a condom correctly do you really think he is ready to be a dad? he will not be around to help you and will run when he realizes what a commitment a child is.      How much older is the man? and how old are you?     now, dont be confused or depressed.   you are not alone at this and there are probably people that can help you make the best decision about how to handle this situation.      where are your parents? do you have older siblings you can talk to? can you talk to your parents? counselor? some adult you trust?     honestly keeping this baby will take over your life for the rest of your life.      waking up every 2 hours to feed the baby, you need money for baby clothing, food etc.   it will completely change your life.  forget college or time for yourself.      your option 2 is caring a baby and giving up for adoption.      option 3 is abortion.  i think this is probably your best choice for having  a normal life in the end.  i am assuming the guy is much older than you (over 18) although you don't see it now he is in a sense raping you.  he is talking advantage of you in one way or another.      please get out of this relationship and pleeeease find someone you can trust and talk to.
wAJbnHGjaa	Don't be confrontational, but don't give up on counseling either. Let him know clearly that you are not happy with this situation and that it needs to be addressed now. Try to make him understand that you are in this together and that you want to improve yourself as well. Don't give up or things will get worse and/or he (or you) may turn elsewhere for comfort.|`|FsozOO6Zaa	Aw, I'm sorry to hear. Try to comfort him and cheer him up, change things around with you guys and the mood. Maybe he is going through a mid-life crisis?|`|7cjqT33Baa	I wouldn't tolerate that at all.  We all have issues.  You have shown him that you care and want to help...and he doesn't let you.  What he is doing is impeding on your life and your right to a peaceful existence.  I would flat out tell him that you can't deal with that any more and that if he didn't want to get help for it, you can't spend your life living with someone that chooses to make every day so unhappy for you.  There really is more to life than that.  It's not fair to your child either to set that kind of example.  I have been in your situation and did exactly what I said.|`|AA10211580	You can't make him go to counseling or get help when he doesn't want to. Pressuring him will only make it worse. I'm the same way with my spouse. I wanted him to get help but he is unwilling.  Maybe your spouse is not a "sit down and talk to me" person. You can try to ask him how his day is while you're making dinner or something and maybe he'll open up.  If he even opens up, just listen, don't interrupt him when he speaks and let him vent and don't judge him. Act like you're listening and just tell him "I understand". If he's having a bad day just avoid him and let him be. If he he's being negative, leave the room and give him space. If he's being positive, come back to the room.  You can try sending him ecards that tells him that you're thinking about him, if he checks his email. People love receiving ecards so maybe he'll appreciate it.  If we change the way we behave towards other people, then they will react differently towards us.   Hope this helps!    Edit: I will never tell people to stay or to leave their marriage/relationship. It's a personal decision one has to make on their own.|`|7HKt8NIuaa	You need to let him know that you really love him and assure him that you're always there whenever he needs someone to talk to. Force him to talk to you wouldn't be the best way.    Tell him that even you can't help with his problem but you're willing to listen. Do not push him too hard to open up to you, he doesn't want to tell you for a reason, when he's ready, he will open up to you automatically.    Perhaps you can do some non-verbal thing to show him that you love him; a little note or hold his hand tightly to assure him that you're there whenever he needs  you...    He didn't want to tell you probably because he loves you and he doesn't want to hurt you. Just give him some time...|`|DlCcFu1eaa	A lot of times guys just don't want to talk about it or especially argue about things. Women like to go over everything with a fine tooth comb. Guys would just rather have some space sometimes and maybe forget about the problem and just have some happy time and fun. Women seem to us to be always complicating everything and making problems out of everything. Especially when we first wake up in the morning or first get home at night. We want to unwind and just enjoy life for a bit. The best time to talk about problems is after sex or after food. Not before or during.    So if you want him to let you in, don't bring problems or stresses with you. Just bring a smile and a fun loving mischievous spirit and he'll let you in.|`|y5j97EXuaa	David Chapelle has your answer on youtube and here's the link    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZRflz-93...|`|bcfc4a553a788c7a7c8b0ab6973ab6c7aa	You can't fix him or change him in any way. So just try and make things as easy as you can and if that still don't work then open your eyes and see that you can only take so much. You don't deserve it and niether does that kid. Good luck.
ZhVgTYPZaa	1. Friends are there for you when you need them. They don't like you in spite of your quirks, but because of them :) They see you at your worst, and stick with you because they know you'd do the same for them. Your family is great, but it's also important to have people your age that you can talk to about anything.   2. I lost my grandmother last year, and at first I didn't want to talk to anyone about it. But my friends knew something was wrong, so I told them. I was afraid they wouldn't know how to act around me and it would be awkward, but they were great. They surprised me with a shopping trip at a random time, were there when I needed a shoulder to cry on, and treated me like a normal person.  :)|`|jp5lfmzTaa	You are    Waht to parents?  What to spouse?  waht to offsprings?    Stiil there is spavce left and that too very  important.    That is for friends.    Vibes in unison. Will be there for whatever you are. Its great feeling.|`|y3V0R26aaa	everyone needs someone sometimes|`|2dNs6YQoaa	friends r very important in everyones life.....if u wanna know how?  then be my friend and then you yourself will come to know that friends r so important in life......|`|6QfQVuPuaa	So tuff is your question baby !!    In which school do you go?? I can expect this question from a school going kid only !!    A friendship is the purest form of relationship (with some exceptions) which exist on earth. Friends are important in your life for numerous reasons : they PLAY with you, they `SUPPORT you, they ENJOY with you, they GUIDE you, they make you feel like LIVING thing, they HELP you, They CARE for you and the list goes on and on......    Friendship to happen is not dependent on any circumstances...  It can happen anywhere :  in park, in a bus, in a school, in a college, in a ceremony, in an occasion, in a market place, in a mall, in a park, in office .........anywhere !!|`|tgnj7m7haa	1. friends are the people who take the place of yr parents in the later stages in yr life. usually u tell yr parents all yr problems wen yr small but as u grow older u confide more in ppl around u than yr parents.finding the right person to share these problems and thoughts is a tough problem but wen u have found the right person its a blessing.  2. well there was this one incident in my life where i had a serious bike accident and i was badly injured. at tat time no one was willing to even help me. jus to my luck my frnds were coming on tat road and they admitted me in a hospital and wasted a whole day jus to take care of me. tats wat is real frndship. these guys later on even used to come see me almost everyday in my house and give me the notes to study for my semester exams. i really owe them a lot.|`|nFlOQg4Laa	Honestly that word runs very slim now days...because people who say they are your friends later become your enemies and people that just fall of your list. So friends you have to be able to trust he/she the person is cool to be around...and for someone to tell thoughts and opinions with. Meeting people in school is where most friendships build. Or even just commenting in the streets and exchanging numbers. Style attracts a lot of people to each other. But i hope I helped.
2SSD6BP9aa	Dude.  It's not unusual to feel urges like this at your age.  You just have to know enough not to act on them.    The best thing you can do to control yourself at school is to masturbate every morning before school.  And if you need to, you can do it again when you get home from school.    Just stay out of the girls bathroom and locker room, or you will end up in major trouble.    And don't let other people here make you feel like a freak for having natural urges.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Save your masturbation for at home. Do it before school and before bed. That should take care of your daily urges. There is no reason to get totally naked either.|`|d956b5a86c3910ccc374a8987ce51194aa	find a slut and get it on|`|1dNZb7Y4aa	eh...  u need help.  go to a guidence counsler.  that cannot be good...  go get help.  good luck.|`|velIdcbNaa	Well what helps my guy friends is looking at the teacher.  Usually that is a big turn off.  If that doesn't work then pay attention  or do something else.      Getting naked isn't right either.  If you take care of buisness before you go to school and when you get home you should be fine.|`|y3V0R26aaa	dude,once you get laid the masturbating will slow down but I THINK YOU NEED TO GET HELP!|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	maybe you should try the porn or molester section.|`|ixsUWp5Aaa	wow .. i think its  just your hormones|`|DtIcDLTcaa	it is normal to masturbate but you may be going a little too far.  it's best to talk to your guidance counselor or your parents.  maybe you should try and get involved with other activities like sports, etc.    perhaps the post should be under adolescents.
AA10982164	It may be a little hard, but he should file to have his case heard again.     He needs to take every check stub, and proof that he is trying to get a better, more regular job.     Have him put in job applications, and keep a record of every application turned in. He will have to file a motion in court, but check with the court clerks office, there is probably a way he can do that without hiring a lawyer.    It is not likely that he can have back child support changed, but he may be able to get at least a temporary reduction due to the work situation.    In the future, be sure that he is completely honest when turning in jobs. If he was working somewhere else, they probably knew about it. They actually can verify employment through social security records. It is better to have to pay more at times than have to explain discrepancies later.     I applaud him for being willing to pay his due share, and he can probably work out a plan to pay a small amount at a time on the back child support. My granddaughter has a deadbeat Dad, and my daughter would be glad to have any help.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Since he is the one paying child support, if he wants to change court ordered child support due to changes, he must file in family court..this is his issue to confront|`|AA11388175	he needs to find a job, or you will have to pay it for him, or he can go to jail...  he KNEW he would have to pay support... he should have been paying all along so he wouldnt owe so much...  sorry
aX5PY2Ktaa	If you really want a car then get a job and buy one yourself. That's what I had to do, I mean I come from a single income home so I didn't have a choice either. Honestly it has taught me so much though having to pay for everything myself. Maybe you're mom just isn't ready to face reality that you are growing up and that you are legal to drive. Maybe she is still denying it. It's not that difficult to get on the phone and call the insurance company yourself, some companies allow you to get quotes online too.|`|nusNVPmZaa	no ,if you told you that she was going to but you a car, she should do what she says or stop making promises that she is not going to keep. period. my mom does that all the time and it pisses me off|`|2fG6NpUkaa	yep that is a mom for you my mom says alot of things and goes back on her word, so you will prob have to get a job to buy your own car.

For ex, I love my chest but hate my bottom(wish it was larger). But the fact remains that he loves u still(no matter what ur chest size). If he hasnt said anything abt it, u shouldnt care.  But if he does comment on how small ur breasts are then u might wanna rethink ur relationship.  I am sure he has his own insecurities abt his body also.   Good luck and enjoy ur time with ur bf.|`|WAEWC3wQaa	Your sense of self esteem does not come from your bf, as good as he may be to you, but from the fact that you are a child of God. Love who you are and don't let anyone's opinion of you shape how you feel about yourself, if you do, your sense of self worth or self esteem will always fluctuate depending on who you meet and so forth. It's so much better to love yourself for who you are, everybody has something about their body that they don't like but if we focus in on it too much, it can take on gigantic proportions (no pun intended). Everybody has different perceptions and you can't please everyone all the time. If someone really loves you, they won't be concerned about how big or small your body parts are.    God Bless|`|CLB32006aa	He never said anything about them, so why do you think he is disappointed about them?

Look in the mirror and find something you like and focus on it. Don't spend your life crying over your looks.|`|bxqwIjyeaa	if you think your chest is perfect, it is. there will always be someone who will think so, even if it isnt your current boyfriend. you will eventaully meet someone who will love every part of you. but for now, its probably not even a big deal to him, if it REALLY bothers you, and i mean really, then you should talk to him about it. but dont get offensive or else you might just start an argument over nothing|`|yuOuoCfDaa	Gyrl you need to look to yourself for your confidence in addition to self respect.  I do think tat your boyfriend is a plus in your life, cause we all need positive reinforcements to grow.  But at some time you will have to stand on your own two feet because push comes to shove if he is no longer around what are you going to do.  Will you revert to no self esteem or can you stand on your own with your head held high.  Just a few words to think about.  Confidence comes from within, YES a few people will come in and out of your life, some may even stay that can be an asset to your growth mentally/physically etc.  It all comes from you if he were a bad person he could basically make and break you

AA10065812	First, send four letters of intent to pick up the children.  Two to the mother in the hospital, with two copies going to the grandmother.  Send two of the letters certified, and two with delivery confirmation.   This way, if the certified letters are refused, the others will still arrive and you can get confirmation off the post office web site.    If you involve the police, you will need to get a fresh copy of your custody order from the Clerk of the Court, and have it certified by them that it is current.  The police may not be willing to order her to produce the child, but make sure they file a report and get a copy.  Also take witnesses, and have them create notarized statements that you were denied the child.  Do this every weekend until you get the children or have a hearing.  While you are at the Clerk of the Court office, ask for a form to file a Pro Se motion to enforce a family court order.    Im a Fathers Rights Advocate for 20 years.       Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.    Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.      Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  Youre that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,    Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...  http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice  http://www.rcfp.org/taping/states/newjer...  http://www.glennsacks.com  http://www.parentalalienation.org/|`|NH2Yg2x3aa	Take your court order and a cop to her house and demand her to hand the child over.

9GUZzm5Saa	Finding That Elusive G-Spot    A G-spot on a woman is not easy to find, but once you do you can give her great pleasure and intense orgasms. When your partner is lying on her back you can find the G-spot located around 1.5 inside the vagina on the vaginas upper wall. The most intense orgasms can come when a woman has her G-spot stimulated.     The G-spot tends to have a different texture that the rest of the vagina, as it has ridges and is not as smooth. When the G-spot is aroused it can feel a bit spongy. If your partner has a G-spot orgasm you will know it, as she will be in heaven for a few minutes afterwards. It is defiantly beneficial for you to find your partners G-spot, as it will not only make her feel fantastic but she will thank you for it in reciprocal ways.    Here is one G Spot technique that may bring your partner to ultimate bliss. Having your fingers around 2-3 inches inside her vagina move them in circles around the inside of the vagina. Keep firm and constant pressure on all the walls of the vagina while you are fingering her. You can add a bit more pressure near her stomach but make sure you do not break the steady circular rhythm. Stop rotating your fingers and keep your fingertips on the, generally ridged, area of her vagina, which is a little behind her pubic bone exerting pressure upwards towards her stomach. This is direct stimulation of the G-spot and it tends to feel best for your partner when your fingers are moving about in a subtle and not jerky manner. Depending on what feels better for her you can either move your fingers in slow circles or keep your fingers pointed and keep them rolling back and forth over the G-spot. You can tell by her body language what area feels the best and what motion feels the best. But it also never hurts to ask, as the better you are at communication in the sack the more likely you are to find out where her erogenous zones, in this case the G-spot, are.    A more advanced technique of G-spot stimulation is combining the two finger motions listed just above. Using your fingers you can trace the inside of her vagina while moving in and out of it. You have to be sure that the ends of your finger are always going over the G-spot after each rotation of your fingers, as this will give it constant stimulation and may build up to an intense orgasm. You have to find the rhythm and technique that gives her the most pleasure and when you have found it she will definitely be glad you did.    When you move to intercourse try to use the angle and position where her G-spot will still be stimulated. If you stimulate the G-spot during intercourse it will make it more likely that she can reach orgasm.    This site is a great resource site.|`|R9OfKCEjaa	Every woman has that particular spot which can be found inside the vagina, about the length of your whole middle finger up.    It is a rough, bumpy surface on the tummy side of the canal. You have to curve your finger to reach it.    Some people's are more sensitive than others, so its best to have a little experiment and see how it feels.    The best orgasms in sex come when both the gspot and clitorus are being stimulated at the same time.|`|wd893RR8aa	inside of vaginal opening about an inch or 2 from the opening..   on the top (abdomen side)  and is roughly behind the clitoris... it is ridged and the lining does not feel like the rest of the vagina
ZjM0ghSnaa	I think he does like you!     The only way to find out if he likes you is if he actually asks on v-day. if he doesnt, then you can try to ask yourself. idk, but just talk this week, about anything. Try flirting a bit, and if he flirts back, then im positive that he's into you. All you have to do is wait on v-day. im sure he'll ask to be his valentine, after all, he does give off those signs. Maybe he's afraid of asking you. some guys show that they like you, and girls usually get that vibe, but they do get shy sometimes to show their feelings sometimes. Dont worry about, time will tell all:)    Best of luck and hopefully it all works out!|`|Ht3tnJgXaa	hey babe just get him by himself and be like we need to talk  and be like i really like you and i want to know if you like me to   (simple) he could only say he do or he don't    guy like when you go right to the point just to let you know       good luck with your new boyfriend  take it from doctor love      do as i say and you will bag your new man     if you need more advice hall at you boy|`|oYF3nIbsaa	Sure maybe ask a friend if they think he is into you.

If so, then give him something, but make it bigger and better than everyone else's. Makes sure he sees the difference. If you're not giving anyhting to anyone else, then get him something nice, and make sure he knows it's from you.     P.S. You could also do the Cluless thing, and buy yourself some reeeeeeeally big, nice Valentine's stuff and make sure he sees it so that he sees how "wanted" you are ;)
JUXpVYC4aa	HUN you tell that "friend" of yours.... "***** you ain't my mamaa!!!!!" and laugh at her!  She obviously thinks she can control you, which is NOT TRUE!  COME out of your shell with confidence!  Even if she starts swearing at you, threatening you... WHATEVER!  Shrug it off.  She's just very angry because you're competition for her!  You don't leave the boy until you don't have feelings for him anymore!  She's fighting with you to impress him, I can't tell you what to do, but I Suggest leaving both of them behind and moving on!

07o05D64aa	Two reasons:    1)Younger girls are easier to get with. It's been proven that women mature faster than men because women knows how to deal with emotions. With guys it takes awhile. With that said, these "guys" must be immature and being with a mature girl is intimidating. A mature guy would want a women, not a girl. Also, they are afraid of growing up, another sign of immaturity. Usually this is a phase, and eventually they  will put some sense into their other "head." and realize its time to grow up. Have you seen the movie beautiful girls with matt dillon? That movie says it all.     2) Also being with a younger girl makes them feel younger. A guy goes through a midlife crisis and buys all these unnecessary things, or things a typical 25 yr old guy would have. A perfect example is hugh heftner. Sometimes it is not a phase, it can last forever, especially if they are millionaires and extremely rich. They figure I have all this money, I can get that young hot girl.    Yeah it sucks that sometimes you go out with these guys, but ask yourself are you the type of girl that would want to date these guys?|`|3QIoa38Naa	Wait, you know guys that go to El Salvador to get laid by pre-teens?|`|0Pjn3T4gaa	i know it is gross. its really just a sad way to get their youth back. which aint workin
7YdYYpLZaa	yes friends come and go just like boys come and go... cos eventually in life, u realise u must move on. its better to have 2 or 3 friends than to have a whole bunch of friends|`|3y0w1qIBaa	High school changes people.  Friends come and go.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	1 really good friend is all you need!|`|sC2aSAXaaa	I know how you feel. Sometimes when you move or others move, you lose the people you care about. I know when I moved i lost a lot of close friends, its not the same when your a part. Its hard! But you gotta just keep trying and keep your head up. If it is meant to be it will work out. But sadly as much as it hurts friends do come and go. But they will always leave an impact on you and they will always be in your heart.|`|c67H67ppaa	Nothingswrong with you. That same thing happened to me. As long as you always know that you will have someone to call when things go wrong, your set :)

I'll be praying for you!|`|Mf88N9G0aa	One thing that you can do is write your mom a letter. (Not D) And try to tell her in the letter how it makes you feel when she compares you to D. Since I'm sure it's very hard to talk to you mom about this stuff, maybe a letter will help.

So make sure to wear a thong while sleeping with him. Also, try a rainbow kiss. If you don't know what that is its when the girl softly bites the mans lower part to get some stuff in her mouth and the guy like the girls lower part to get some period blood. Than you french kiss. Also, you can feel all the parts you want... or need:) for example, his nipples. Like around them ans slightly bite the to of one. Hold his lower part and move it around yours. Wear loosely fitting cloths so he ca rip them off easier. Also wrap your legs around his nakedly. Then roll and french kiss him. Hope this helps Oh and dont forget to keep moving his hands to feel your boobs and lower part. Kissing parts (upper and lower) and adding a soft bite can create a sensational and naught feeling|`|bmT12Kx5aa	no one can answer this questian cause no one knows what u already do so all these people giving u advise may be telling u stuff u already do so sorry cant really help, but here is somthing that i really like, let him nut in ur mouth and swallow it or  try anal|`|Z3l08BDAaa	sex|`|EzpEyVnraa	his fantasy.|`|RumoQkohaa	strip tease is hot!|`|9gtl24WLaa	sex|`|72Rrtfhqaa	men only think about sex|`|ff773b4421ffa9e7eafcc4dac827ff9daa	Kama Sutra!|`|AA10495394	blow jobs, threesomes, go to a swingers party
JlDcVTVsaa	i think you can watch is together.   just have a grownup talk about it, and decide to watch it together, and even try the new things you like.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I think you both need to read this from Family Life.    What is pornography? It certainly isn't what it's presented to be - an acceptable outlet for sexual expression without a partner, or an aid to those who wish to enhance their sex lives within a relationship. No...in reality, porn is an addictive, visually stimulating, mind altering drug that can bring Godly people to their knees in spiritual defeat.    And in the end, pornography destroys marriages...by perpetrating a great LIE that many men find almost impossible to resist...    "My wife isn't good enough"    No wife can compete with pornography. Why? Because pornography lies! Pornography portrays women as always wanting sex; as always looking and dressing sexy; as always reacting to sex with euphoric enthusiasm; as always doing what men want and always enjoying what men to do them.    Therefore, when a wife doesn't measure up in bed to the women in pornography, the man rejects her and turns to the pornography - thinking he'd rather have the porn than have his wife. Proper and truly fulfilling sexual intimacy, characterized by mutual respect and satisfaction, is shattered.    Men in particular, listen up! Here's the TRUTH about pornography...    It's bondage - If pornography controls your life in any way, you're an addict - and it has the same diabolical hold on a person's life as alcohol or drug addiction, except that porn addiction is more of a mental than physical bondage. Porn addiction can only end in private, and possibly even public, disgrace and humiliation.    It's a turn off to your spouse - Another lie of pornography is that it'll make you a more proficient lover. A pastor who has counseled hundreds of couples who've dealt with porn addiction revealed that nearly all the women, when they did consent to sex with their husband, never achieved an orgasm. They went through the motions because they knew their husband was not making love to them; he was only thinking of his porn fantasy.    It is adultery - When you use pornography, your wife experiences the same pain and betrayal as if you'd committed adultery with another woman...and her feelings are fully supported by Scripture (Matthew 5:27-28). The Bible also exhorts husbands to love their lives unconditionally and sacrificially, with Christ Himself as your model (Ephesians 6:25,28). This is impossible when pornography is in your life.    It kills trust - Because of your addiction, your wife endures a roller coaster of emotions - feeling used, broken, numb. At first she may blame herself for your problem, but eventually she'll just become angry and hurt. The trust in your marriage, undermined by your deceit, may take years to rebuild. Not only does she not want to be with you sexually. Unless you forsake your addiction, she'll not want to be with you at all.    It's separation from God - When your mind is given to pornography, you cannot have intimacy with God because porn is your idol (Colossians 3:5). When you belong to Christ, you will live by the Spirit and put to death your sinful nature, including sexually immorality (Galatians 5:16-19,24). Porn addiction cannot have any part in your life if you desire to please God and live for Him.    The even greater truth is that pornography addiction can be defeated. Hope and healing is available through God! The process will take time, and won't be easy. But when porn is purged from a marriage, you will know complete intimacy in your relationship like never before!

If he doesn't care and still looks at porn while he's in front of you, then sell his computer or have someone hold it for you until the situation gets better. If he wants to use the computer, he's gonna have to go to the library (they block porn sites over there so he can't access it anyway).  Do some tough love on him.|`|3wjoT0W6aa	your husband is an idiot.  he shouldn't be watching porn if you guys are intimate so often.  he, also, sounds like he wants to have fun without you.

Porn is a deal breaker. Start skimming money from him for an escape fund, and get rid of him. Porn is a form of cheating. I hope you don't have kids, as I imagine it would hurt your relationship if not destroy it by way of his betrayal.    MARRIED MEN HAVE NO BUSINESS LOOKING AT PORN. THEY SHOULD ONLY HAVE EYES FOR THEIR WIVES.|`|tcyuTHjPaa	Watch it with him,trust me he will want you more!|`|RUTQTgCyaa	Lots of men watch porn...sometimes it's easier. Excuse what I am about to say but...by watching porn he can get himself off without having to please you and in porn those women do things that maybe we in everyday life won't do. Maybe he gets bothered with you watching it because he feels that it is something that is beneath you...for instance alot of men drink and smoke but doesn't want a woman that does. If it bothers you that he watches it then let him know it and tell him that you would feel better about this if he tried to quit watching that type of stuff because the more he watches it, eventually it will start to hurt you guys sex life. So just tell him how you feel and go from there.|`|XGHLrOklaa	He's addicted. If he loves you he will stop because it hurts you.  If he's a selfish twat then he won't stop ever.    I am so sick of hearing that "it's a guy thing" BS|`|NWH3MnE9aa	LOTTA prudes on here, black stallion. If you start listening to this "Put the computer in the living room" or "start skimming an escape fund" crap, you are going to live a very long, very lonely life. Embrace life; embrace sexuality.

Anyways I don't think you should be embarressed, he is in a church youth band, its not like he will laugh and make fun of you. Its coool, next time you see him tell, ask him if he saw your mom the other day and laugh about the whole situation...maybe your his friend which is your crush will think its cute.|`|OtvAUGv1aa	Wow - you need to relax honey! She's your mother!! That's what they do - as embarrassing as it is, they will do it to you all your life.

7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	If I were the guy, it's likely that I'd probably still want the ex, and not the girl I could have at anytime.  My feelings probably wouldn't grow, and she would only be a rebound.  The ex probably doesn't have feelings for him anymore, which is why she moved on.    If I were the girl he's with now, I'd drop him and find someone who wants to be with me exclusively.  This statement reveals it all: "which is why ***she's doing this to herself***."  The relationship cannot work; the girl knows it, and she's only deluding herself.  There are many, MANY other quality guys out there, and so there's no need to compete for this one (who's not that into you).|`|Ht3tnJgXaa	dance dance dance|`|bFWhuJbuaa	don't you have some grass to mow or something?|`|WQjDQgB9aa	Well, if I were in an eight year relationship, I wouldn't throw it away so carelessly.

Even though she is not close to her mother, she knows she can depend on her more and her mother would understand her more than her father.|`|AA11967247	females can be competitive, a daughter could feel competition (irrational as it is) with her fathers new mate. ..just an idea.|`|AA10652271	sometimes girls feel more connected to their mother than they do their father.|`|3wjoT0W6aa	they probably feel mom would understand more....feelings, boyfriends, makeup, growing pains...|`|ljwJr6u8aa	well I don't feel a girl would want to see her dads flings. not to mention dads are very protective over their daughters|`|vi4JlnJvaa	Mothers are usually more sensitive and nurturing - and intelligent enough, and not shy to maybe go to a support group or counseling to get coping skills as a woman and a "single" mom.  Obviously moms will know more about puberty and body changes and boy issues, Dads usually don't want to hear it because it's uncomfortable or embarrassing for them.      A big issue to keep in mind, however, is what the circumstances are around the divorce.  Maybe one parent was a raging alcoholic and of course no girl or boy wants to live with that.  Maybe one parent cheated and will eventually move or have the significant other move in.  And it depends on the relationships the kids have with either parent as well.  A lot of preteen/teen girls and their moms don't get along during those years of growth.  There are so many factors that come into play.      Good luck on your project!|`|obfK5mSQaa	Mothers can be there for things like cooking and cleaning...the usual.   But also, its just easier to open up to your mom then dad sometimes.|`|LjHjVcfHaa	sometimes their father might now understand how a girs life really is especially depending on the age...usually a girl is more connected to her mother because her mother has been through wat the girl is goin to go through later in her life. maybe its more based on being female. her mother can explain life better than her exhusband could.  I mean I dont think  a lot of females would like for their dad to talk to them about sex or how to always use protection, or about stds and stuff. its just not in their nature really.|`|fMEypXDYaa	Usually it's because any kid wants to stay with the mother because the mother is the care giver and kids always want to be with the ones who care for them. Besides, most judges give custody to the mother anyway, unless she is a unfit mother. Daughters usually want to be with their mothers, since they spend more quality time with the major female figure in their lives who happen to be their mother.

yKcZC9Dhaa	A TV show is not your life. You are not pregnant having homosexuals adopt your bastard kid. Tell him you're aware its a setup, and you are not planning on being in that situation.|`|V9W6fMuVaa	Just tell him its really not a bad show. All it does is show you what goes on in lives of some teens. This of course though is a Television show! It IS not real. Show him the end part, where "Amy" talks about the moral and everything. Haha. It's really a good show, and he should understand.    I am a Christian as well, and I watch the show.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	My husband and I watch that show. We like it.     I think the show is a good concept. There are alot of preg teens. I think this show is showing the good and the bad from getting preg. Hopfully teens will watch this show and realize if they are going to have sex use protection. If they get preg, there is alot to think about. It's not only their life, it's the baby's life too. Teens can't just expect their parents to watch the baby when it comes. Teens need to take responsibility of the baby they brought into this world.     I really hope this show wakes some people up. Maybe you could get your father to watch next weeks show to maybe change his mind about it.     BTW, its not wrong of you to watch the show. If you like it, watch it, no matter what your father says.|`|AFkmdu92aa	my dad freakkked when he saw that on our tivo but i made him watch the end of the show were they explain if your a pregnant teenager and i told him its also on abc family! so he came to his senses:)    i hope it helps:)    good luck!|`|BbkSgytraa	I am also a christian and I LOVE the show!! Remind your dad that you would never do this! I had the same problem! My dad was all like I don't want you watching this stuff and I told him the same thing you told your dad!! He believed me and had gotten off of my case. Have your dad watch the very end of the show were the the girl who plays Amy tells about teens and sexual content. That should help him understand that its a show teaching you what NOT to do. I SO hope this helps!!|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Let him watch the show and decide for himself.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	i had the exact same problem. i am a christian also, but love the show. just remind your dad that you know your morals, you know whats right and whats wrong, and the show reminds you of that. it shows whats right and whats wrong, and it really is reality of today's high schools. and tell him that its really nothing that you havent seen before.

AA11944162	First of all if there just rumors maybe you should ask him first to be sure.  Like when both ya are with a group of friends bring in the subject about prom and be like who is going to prom with who and when they ask you be like im not sure yet but kinda have someone in mind.

f7bcc960cd2e00baa34eee0e5a77df9aaa	I understand where you are coming from. No matter how good the news, or how much my parents would support it, I have a hard time talking to them (and this is not because I am not mature). My parents tend to be critical of everything.    I would recommend inviting them over and announcing it. Or, you could have your boyfriend ask your parents for permission (even though he already asked). He could say that he has already asked you, but wants their blessing. Then, you could call them with the good news afterwords. They already know that you are engaged, but it gave them an opportunity to talk to him about it. They will want to talk with him about how he is going to support you, where you are planning on living, and other stuff in that nature!    Good luck! Best wishes on the announcement and the wedding :)|`|jK9H6PHiaa	just tell them. i told mine, i was engaged at 18 but i had a full time job, my own house, and my own car, house insurance, car insurance, and medical insurance, and a savings account to fall back on in case something where to ever happen. i was very mature for 18 years old and my parents knew that and they accepted me for all my decisions.|`|R2BBjtaraa	of course you should.  they'll find out eventually, right?  if you really love him that's all that should matter.|`|mqpN7rXcaa	Well how long have you been dating? I say that you stay engaged for a while and start living on your own. and after you get your life together then you tell them|`|HiSVA9p8aa	Get on with it.  If you are mature enough to be engaged, you are mature enough to own up to this relationship.    Make sure that you include the details that you don't plan on marrying until you are finished college or whatever is true in your case.|`|cGbTJobeaa	If you can't tell your parents (other than them being psycho dysfunctional idiots who you haven't spoken to in years) immediately upon the proposal, then you probably shouldn't be getting married.  Wait a few years.  You'll thank me later.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Well if you are sure that your parents love him then tell them.  Don't be surprised though if they try to tell you guys to wait awhile. because they feel you are too young.|`|oXfvBdNHaa	Grow up. Your age isn't the problem. If you can't tell mommy and daddy, you shouldn't be getting married.|`|HyfqftlKaa	Agree with Balooba. Wait until you're mature enough to face your parents.    If you are nervous to tell them because they don't like him, reconsider your guy, parents might be old fashioned, but they will have your best interest in heart, so if they don't like a guy after knowing him for awhile, there is probably a reason why, hopefully that isn't you case though.|`|x5PgcqZfaa	Just tell them...your 18 your an "adult" and saying yes to a proposal is an adult decision so be an adult and tell them.|`|V4rc9ijEaa	aw how cute. well invite your parents to dinner and in dessert time tell them you are engaged.|`|29I8PWrxaa	Personally, I don't think it's a real engagement until you share the news.      You should tell your parents.  Yes you are young, and in my opinion, a bit too young to be engaged.  But I know, that's not what your question asked.    You should tell them so they can share in your news and start planning the big day.  Anyone who is too immature to tell their parents is too young to be married.
x5PgcqZfaa	really the only plan would be to get your brother to agree to let you move in with him until you can get on your feet and get your own place.

Make sure your brother is okay with you coming out.  Try to have a job lined up before you go, even if you are planning on going to school. You will strain your relationship with him if you are always asking for money.  And if he has a new baby he will be under enough financial and emotional stress.

I've loved this boy for four years. We were together for one. And of course, I was out-of-my-mind in love with him enough to do anything for him. I was very young and I gave him everything I had. He dumped me and told me he never loved me and I found out the entire time we were together, he loved someone else...I had to read the e-mails he sent to "her" and I think getting my ankle broken into a thousand shattered pieces would have been less painful than reading how much he would have rather been with her than me.  Now, I see him everyday at school...and it hurts so bad my heart hurts. He doesn't even say hi..    I don't know how the happiest time of my life was also the one thing I wish never happened. It's like I would rather be naive to just how amazing the world can be than to miss him one more day..    This was two years ago  I haven't stop hurting...time hasn't heal a thing.|`|zUPurzALaa	I'm not sure you ever "let it go",  the love is always there, no motter what you do or who you are with.  It has been many years, and I always feel the longing to be with this person, but I still live my life, work, socialize and date too.  I have a bf who is a joy to be with.  I give all of me while I'm with him, but in my secret moments, I think of my true love.|`|IIoouep5aa	YES!!  im still trying to get over it =[  i hate it, considering i see this person EVERYDAY =/

REVEAL YOURSELF!|`|LK6b9srqaa	id go with some sort of meeting eachother face to face arrangement, IM texting and even phonecalls dont reveal always what there is to a relationship, people develope feelings for eachother through touch smell closeness any number of things that can never happen online or the phone|`|8uNLDeLQaa	that can be hard. but if he don't have feelings for you  yall should just be friends an see how it goes from there. good luck|`|4XCg1mIMaa	talk to him and let him know how you feel. If he is your best friend he will understand.|`|mTgCeSz8aa	meet him. find out if you guys have good chemistry|`|gn6BI2Plaa	he will understand if he is ur best frn|`|dgOGBICEaa	Look, I somehow find that you may think ya'll are best friends.  But, if you have only met him a couple of times and you met him over a chat room phone thing, I say that you should give up on him.  It's ridiculous to fawn over a guy that you will only see a couple of times, and you only talk to him on the phone.  I'm sure he has a life and doesn't think of you that way.  Even if he did like you, long distance relationships usually don't work out so well.  So, move on and find someone that you can see on a daily or even weekly basis.  Not someone that you talk to on the phone everyday.  He may love you, but it is probably only as a friend.  There is someone out there for you!  It just isn't some guy that you found on the phone.  I promise.|`|dVgqFDpIaa	tell him i love you|`|hhMlN2zRaa	Well everyone has some really good ideas if I can add my 2 cents I say you need to talk to him.  First you need to decide if you could handle having him as a friend if he says he doesn't feel the same. You need to be completely honest with him and let him know that you don't want to lose him as a friend (if you can decide you can handle that).  If you can't handle that then you need to know you may lose him.  I also think that you will have to make a trip out to NY to talk to him.  You should definitely tell him in person.  Hope that helped!

I HOPE YOU WON'T REALLY DO THIS HAHAHAHA*
u6c5bTbVaa	I've been in the same situation, but I got kicked out for a little bit for speaking up even when I didn't cuss. The thing is, while you're living under his wing, you have to learn to deal with it (and I even haven't, so I'll admit I'm a bit of a hypocrite.). Every day I have to deal with my step-dad's racist and homophobic lifestyle... and it's not easy. I don't think it's wrong of you, but if your dad does then it's not a good idea period. I don't think it's fair that you can't speak your mind, but it goes the same way with respecting your dad. Just reading that made me feel your frustration, trust me. In my opinion, you might have went a bit overboard by cussing at a parent, but I believe you have every right to be a little mad.    But try to make sure you don't get into the same situation next time, like finding somewhere else to do your work. Good luck. :)|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Wrong|`|jPlUycx0aa	Your both in the wrong. your father shouldnt have ignored your request and you shouldnt have disrespected him.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	He is your father and that is his house. He can talk whenever, where ever, and how ever he feels. You are lucky you didnt get smacked in the mouth.    If you were my kid I would have back handed you and sent you to your room!|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	dad    ur rong 4 yellin and cursin at him    but he is rong also. he should have atleast made a qesture that he heard u instead of blowin u off.    both are at fault be he needed to be show his respect for you by answerin or atleast acknowleging your question.    if u asked 4-5 times he HAD 2 of heard it. but you shouldnt yell at ur parents tho. no matter how selfish they may be. just be the bigger person and next time try gettin head phones. they may help block out the talkin.|`|HjMbOgvqaa	Well you should not curse at your dad but he should also respect your space to and you did ask nicely and more than once is it possible to move the computer|`|QRSRJ7U1aa	You already know dissing Dad because you got angry was a error.      First it did no good -- repeat first it did no good--    and second you have absolutely no valid excuse for calling your father such foul names. Remember those stone things Moses brought down off the mountain??? One of those in the middle.....    Besides that,  name calling is such a weak tool.  It only works on beaten down or weak minded people and mostly it is only used by weak minded people and bullies.        If your family lacks respect for one another then simply asking for respect won't work.  It needs to be brought up when no one is angry and discussed as a way to create more unity in the household.  You will never shout peace and mutual goodwill into existence.    That said if all you wanted was to get back at them for pissing you off then well sounds like this really works.  Raise the old dude's blood pressure til he strokes out and then see how you like being fatherless or maybe worse (having to wipe his drool off his chin and take him to rehab!)    I'm sorry.  I am probably old enough to be your grandmother and I really should be gentler with you but I just thought I would say that to (maybe) wake you up to that possibility.|`|iYprPfH5aa	He should have respected you, but if he wasn't getting the hint I would have moved into a different room or at least closed the door.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	it does not matter what he did to you he is your dad and therefore you need to respect him. you are sorry that you can't just focus on what you are doing and ignore them i can do it have done it for years. i suggest you tell him you are sorry and not cuss at him again hes your dad till the day you die show him that respect period.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	well it is rude of them to ignore you and it is a little hypocritical for them to tell you that your selfish and then they're selfish, but the situation got out of hand. it really wasnt that big a deal, but you made it a big deal.|`|AK7rEpl8aa	i think he is at more fault that you   i mean if u were doing something that wasn't important than i would have said you were but you asked him several times and nothing|`|OLQmoyNSaa	nooo.  i cuss at my dad, hes okay with it.  but my mom gets all crazy o_o  *if your dad cusses at you first, you have the  right to cuss bak at him :P|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	for starters let me inform you that it is not your house it's his house.  he can do what he wants when he wants and if you don't like it... too bad!!!!!!!!!!!    if you were my kid and had talked to me like that. you wouldn't have had a computer to fill out your fafsa on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|FHrQzaPqaa	you were wrong for cussing your father out.But what you should have  tried was pull him to the side and talk to him and asked can your and  my brother go in the next room.|`|B4aB5XMaaa	no..u should have yelled.. u dad is a doosher...|`|385b5c9d7cdef8d18d881b50a9b24b0faa	him...  you have a right to be mad.  it was kind of harsh to curse, but he was not respecting your personal needs.|`|8AoGWNvnaa	You're both wrong.  He should have paid you attention and done what was (nicely) asked, you were wrong for cursing at your father.  No matter that he was wrong, he's still your father.  Your dad and brother sound like the kind of people that need to be told that you're showing them respect - not by you or you'll sound like a moron, but by someone else - your mom maybe?     I know it's hard to respect those that don't respect you, but we have to start the cycle somewhere, right?    Who's more wrong? I want to say your father, but then I remember you cursed back, and that makes it hard for me to reply as such.  I don't think you were *more* in the wrong, though.      I think I'd have done about the same as you did, as much as I hate to admit it.
EQaGQ6hWaa	no im like that too i dont like to make an effort to make friends its just how u are there are a lot of people who are like you me being one of them lol....its just that im a lazy person but if people make the effoet to know me they always like me afterwards

When you waived any rights you had to the house, he waived any rights he had to you helping him use it to get a loan.    If he needs someone to co-sign a loan, he'll have to find someone else. You're smart not to do this unless he nullifies the pre-nup and puts your name on the deed.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	Perhaps there is some way out of the current financial jam that does not involve taking out a big loan.  I don't know what the issue is, but taking out loans is kinda like putting a bandaid on financial problems instead of solving them anyway.  Maybe more brainstorming is called for.   Could you guys sell something?  Cut back on monthly expenses?  I think you are right to be skittish about signing this loan.  I wouldn't do it if I were you, or *at least* not without consulting a lawyer.|`|f4c35d4729f3cfcc287328ffc6b7f9a8aa	NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...   Sign NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Re post this in law & ethics and watch the reaction you get!    And yes, if you sign it, you own it, so HELL NO!      Take that pre-nup to your own attorney and find out where you stand asap, I think hubby is setting you up to take a hell of a fall, and soon.|`|AA10248966	DO NOT SIGN!! END OF DISCUSSION.|`|lgyPxg26aa	No, No, NO, NO!  Do NOT sign anything like that.    A waiver signed with him does NOT remove your obligation to the mortgage company if he defaults on the loan.  Do NOT sign ANY loan papers.    Do NOT sign anything he puts in front of you without reading very carefully first.    Signing those mortgage papers would be like paying the dealership for a car, but letting them keep it for you.  You can look at it, maybe even sit in it, but you can never reap the benefits of owning it.    Your marriage is in trouble and getting deeper in debt with him only makes it harder to get out if you need to.    Work on the marriage, if you want it to work.  Signing the mortgage papers just to make him feel better will not give your marriage any long term boost.|`|AA11538662	NOOOOOO! Do NOT sign. The home is legally his if your name is not on the deed. If you sign, you will need him to do  a QUIT CLAIM deed adding your name to the house. But if the marriage is unstable, I would not bother.    Mary in Camden, MI|`|5eb82f15d183d6d66fa6225d22e2faabaa	Nooo...if your name is on the loan and you divorce, you will still be obligated to pay on that debt.  He sounds like a jerk.  Don't fool yourself that signing that would help your marriage. It may just set his boat upright enough that he can move on & find someone else. Get out now!!|`|m13CCGc1aa	Do not get a home equity loan with your husband unless the prenup is thrown out.    It sounds like now is not the best time in your marriage to be accumulating any debt.    If you get a divorce, you will be stuck with the loan also.|`|vi4JlnJvaa	If you co sign on the loan, especially as a married couple, if you do (God Forbid) get a divorce, you have to split the assets AND debt.  I wouldn't do it, unless he rips up the pre-nup, or you make an addendum to the pre-nup saying something like all debt incurred from that loan will solely be his.  I'm sure there's some legal-eze that would cover your butt.    I do wish you the best in your marriage and personal happiness; good luck.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	well if he owns it already then I would say ok, but I want my own income and there has to be a clause to this one, because I feel children are better off with the mother when the mothers are good mothers. I don't want a divorce and take the kids away from their home.I think the prenup is like saying I don't trust you or I only want to be with you for awhile, or it could also be saying I am not sure your not a greedy ********* and going to take me for all that I have.or I think you are just going to marry me for my money.|`|1ycL4PZ8aa	There are a few key things. 1). Your marriage is unstable. 2). No one borrows money on their home that already has money readily available. 3). No one knows what homes are worth anymore. 4). You will be responsible for the loan and you're probably more liquid than a house is right now, anyway.     You need to come to a decision: refuse to join in the loan and just play it by ear. Or, tell him to come clean with his finances, rip up the prenuptial agreement and make all of your assets and liabilities jointly owned so that you will be an equal partner. Or, forget the whole thing, move out and find someone more compatible.|`|9gMQAWBNaa	Boy, this is truly awful and you sound miserable. This is not a good relationship for you, it sounds likes he is using you. What ever you do, do not sign a home equity loan you will be stuck with it, he sounds like a bad one.   My final suggestion is to leave and divorce him immediately.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Nooooooo F'en way.....    Your marriage is entirely too unstable to put your name on a loan in which you can ONLY get screwed by doing!    Don't do it.     You have to ask yourself why he can't get the loan alone (if he owns the home outright)    He protected himself financially, I suggest you do the same. It's only fair!|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	eek!  If you're not owning the asset why have a loan?|`|t9c4vOZmaa	I would not do it if the marriage is already rocky who knows what's going to become of it. Noway if you got a prenup then hes on his own the way I look at it.|`|faT4MyVkaa	Tell him to rip up the pre-nup if he wants you to sign.|`|mjKGbhNYaa	you will be partly responsible for the equity line as far as credt goes. If it is not paid they will put a lein against his house for recovery.|`|jAGwyyuyaa	I sure would not go there. He can't have his cake and eat it too.|`|kz39UPddaa	He shouldn't ask anything of you that he wouldn't do!    If he expects you to sign then surely he expects to be signing 1/2 ownership over to you|`|i98Gut3Maa	Well look at the good side of this Legal Pre-Nup....    Im sure you want to help him, and Im sure he needs your help... So legally make him sign documentation that if anything should happen and there is a problem paying back that loan, that HE and only He is responsible.... BUT make it legal... Just like he Did with you.|`|3jCNZmv3aa	DO NOT SIGN!! Unless he is willing to put your name on the deed absolutely do not put your name on anything. He made it clear about how he felt about keeping his property his so remind him that this is the way he wanted it.  If you feel too overwhelmed, get advise from a lawyer.|`|8txWayVnaa	Honey, why ON EARTH would you sign loan papers on a house that isn't, and never will be, yours?    Yes, you would be stuck with a loan to pay for something that will never belong to you.  HIS financial problems ARE HIS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.      You're not good enough to share his "wealth", but you can share his debt?    OH HELL NO!|`|AA11205004	Please DON'T Do It!!! If you signed a prenup he didn't trust you. He protected himself. Now it's time to protect you. You will be stuck with the obligation of the loan. Please don't do it. Look out for yourself hon!|`|qkblT2hgaa	Hello,  Your problems are bigger than you think. Being married may hold you accountable for half of his debts. Trust me, the Tax Man doesn't care if he accumulated the debt himself, your home and your assets may be seized as well. As for the loan he wants, the home is in his name, he should have no problem putting it up against a loan that he is trying to get. If he is asking you to co-sign, it is because the loan giver is telling him that he will not get any money without your signature as a co-signer. If you don't have an equal share in the house, and he defaults on the loan, the people that loaned him the money will come after you to pay the debt. My best advice is to look in the Yellow Pages under Lawyers. Find one that will give the first hour of consultation for free. Tell them your storey and see what they say. Do not rely on what your friends are telling you. Talk to a Lawyer.    Regards.|`|y21VcTjDaa	I don't think he's being very honest with you as to what the loan is.  A home equity loan is based upon the amount of equity existing in the house and is backed by such.  He would not be eligible for a home equity loan if there wasn't enough equity in his home.  If the equity is there, he probably wouldn't require a co-signer.  Be careful that he isn't getting you to cosign a personal loan for him.  No matter what the loan is for, you would be responsible for half the amount in the event of divorce maybe even all of it since as a cosigner that makes you responsible if he defaults.    He doesn't sound like a very nice man and if it were me I'd be very worried that he was simply trying to ruin me financially...if you cosigned a loan, it would be very easy for him to give you the boot, keep the loan money for himself and leave you paying for it.|`|GGSSxFsUaa	No please don't sign. His assets are safeguarded with the pre nup but, if you get the bank loan you are financially liable. So you will be paying for something you will have no interest in. If he threatens with divorce due to finances or any other simple reason then take it as his loss! He needs to help himself by getting another job and you can help him buy "advising him on financial responsibility."|`|d09d636d7ee51e3ee6fab5d0ec5f9d82aa	HELLLLLZZZZ to the NO. if his income aint enuf to get it then he OBVIOUSLY CANT AFFORD IT!! which means you will be paying for it eventually. so you might as well take your money, go to the nearest toilet, put it in, and flush.     BETTER YET. you need to set up a private account so that you can SAVE and afford to start a stable living environment for you and your children next time he kicks you out (i read your other post). THE NEXT TIME HE KICKS YOU OUT NEEDS TO BE THE LAST TIME....

g2R7e2eVaa	The judge can sign the divorce papers for the respondent but this differs from court to court and state to state. Why dont you try asking the court clerk if the judge will sign the papers in place of your husband.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	You would file a missing spouse divorce. This involves placing a notice of publication in your local newspaper. Its considered "serving" your missing spouse.

cno2OHmzaa	Nah.  I wouldn't sweat it.  If you're still friends after all of the changes you mentioned I'd say she thinks your bond is pretty strong.|`|n53HeORBaa	when the best of friend parted ways they changed unless they still keep in touch with one another plus they meet new people that they got to get along with but you must not be saddened, what you need to do is just to re open communication lines  with your best bud, she might not call you her BFF anymore but you still share an old bond that just lay dormat for a while, just talk to her and before you know it things are the same way again|`|kQ1M5azaaa	hey i had the same deal with my "best friend" we had known each other for over 8 years but then i moved and we both changed she turned getto i turned rocker we use to call each other bfs for life but now its like we dont talk anymore or at least not like we did before.    she probably still considers you a good friend but hey anything can happen like she can replace you like that dont feel bad though i didnt i lived with it     wont you be my bf? lol random i know|`|zJEvYQuOaa	terrible friend you are.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	she likely does. you are the one who is placing this BFF thing and making a big deal out of it. if you don't talk to her that much and she doesn't seem to care about you, perhaps you need to find a good friend.|`|57fZyjvgaa	Not necessarily.  I have 5 best friends.  1 I haven't seen in 2 years.   1 I haven't seen since October 2007.  2 I haven't seen since May.  1 I haven't seen since July.    I talk to 3 on a daily basis, and talk to 2 about once a month. Just because you may not keep CLOSE contact doesn't mean you're not best friends anymore - it just means things have changed... life is busy, sometimes it's too hard to find 5 minutes to make a phonecall. In my situation, I'm in different time zones from some of them which makes it hard, but our friendship is strong enough to know that we'd do anything for each other and our bond can't be broken by time or distance.|`|SHRZH4d3aa	You could always ask her.|`|Uv3h61t9aa	"When it hurts to look back,  and you are scared to look ahead,  look beside you  and your best friend  will be there." :)|`|aNN4BtgSaa	well if she doesn't consider you a good friend then don't claim her either as ur best friend and she wil see how it feels and she wil probably realize|`|9jWjyKeuaa	Not necessarily.  Me and my best friend usually never call each other anything of the sort, it just goes unsaid really.  I guess if you really wanted to know you could always ask her, not like it can do any harm.  If she does consider you her best friend then it'll just be a why are you asking? sort of answer.  If not then that doesn't necessarily mean she doesn't think of you as a close friend either.    You also have to put into consideration that many people use that term differently.  Some throw it around like candy, while others reserve it for someone they truly trust.  She might think of you as a really close friend but not a best friend, if that makes sense.  So that's why she never says it back.|`|sMw0P9F8aa	Ask her if she considers you a best friend.  If she can't answer straightaway yes, then you're better off getting new friends.|`|Et0O4CTZaa	Well, a best friend is a person that cares about you but not a relative. Like I have a best friend and he cares a lot about me and I care a lot about him but we are not relitives. We have only been friends since fifth grade and I am in sixth grade right now.    I think you should hang out with your BFF more. I think you should care about her more. How I became best friends with my BFF is, I gave him stuff like chocholate bars. I gave him things that he likes.    You will be happy when he she calls you BFF.    (I had a friend that I knew since pre school but he is not my best friend.)|`|J4gIGX56aa	wow..u sound like me like im not joking!..well yea thats exactly whats  happening to me..but except that my ''best'' friend has a best friend which is not me..it gets me sad all the time..well enough about me..well   if shes not that much talkative to u as much before..then that means that she wants to drift away from you..but im pretty sure you dont want to lose her so you should take her out on a friday nite and show how fun and great it is that you both are bestfriends then have a talk with her..ask her whats up..she probably has something thats keeping her down|`|kM9xoajHaa	a best friend is someone that stays by your side when you need them at a time in your life|`|6S7CgcQoaa	i have the same sitchuation..... and i really dont know
PakkKi2vaa	You shouldn't listen to people like that. If someone is going to diss you purely because of looks, than they don't deserve your time|`|OnyOsXE1aa	no u are gorgeous and u know it.........|`|AA11439237	Nah, I think you're kinda cute. Going by my personal style, I would cut the hair to be a little bit shorter. Anyway, you're way better looking than me and that girl is pretty damn mean. Don't listen to her, hun, you're cute. =)|`|decWPAHkaa	I'm not a girl I'm a woman but I'll answer your questions any way. First let me say this. don't take what that girl told you seriously, she's definitely not worth your time.   Anyway, you're a cutie pie. Tho a hair cut will bring out more of those handsom features.|`|HmKY6qZDaa	Dude! WTF is that girl's problem!? LMAO. Okay, you are totally sexy no lie. Lol. I don't care if you don't pick me for a best answer I'm not saying that for a best answer. You have the cutest brown eyes and a nice smile.  Wow. Just ignore her. You should be able to get some ladies. Psht. =p|`|2QaFv1yXaa	oh what a jerk. mean girl.      you are cute and i kinda agree you look like the kid from karatee kid too. nooo you aren't ugly and you don't look fat. you look like you could be a really nice, cute kid. i would give you a chance|`|7AFLaiYjaa	to tell ya the truth. You would be cute if you cut your hair. And your not fat.    You look like my friend!|`|0V2UrTqoaa	NO! You're NOT ugly I think you kind of cute! seriously! I would go out with you, e-mail me|`|M4zfLQTNaa	That girl is a loser who doesn't know what she's talking about.|`|wFtL7OTpaa	oh you are not ugly... you are not like a sexy beast or anything but this girl was very mean and she definitely lied... i think you are pretty decent looking and i bet a lot of girls would think you are hott|`|kt774vEraa	Are you kidding? You've got the most kissable lips ever! Your eyes are beautiful! Probably this girl feels fat and ugly herself... Go fish!|`|rPwHPKv5aa	hey karate kid! http://www.imdb.com/media/rm830446848/tt...|`|w2yh8Acraa	you look hot, well with a hat on you do, to be honest, the hair is a little much, but you are awesome, lap dance worthy! woot! i like your scar!|`|cHv02GlYaa	ur actually kinda cute. just cut of some of ur hair and u would be sexy. ur def not fat tho she obviously needs new eyes! but i absolutely adore ur hat!|`|rydsklvWaa	NO!

I agree with everyone above! ^^|`|ZFBL9D1aaa	Keep your hair.  Don't cut that ****. D:|`|AA12381907	you look hott in the second picture !  &&the first picture isn't bad.
rYa2FQ3Vaa	well maybe yu should call her up; and ask her to meet yu somewhere, so yu can just tlk everything out, and gently explained wht happened and why it happened. be totally honest with her; and tht will lead her to be honest with yu. im sure not everything is all of your fault. buh tell her tht yu feel bad or sad because yu and her dont communicte they way yu did before. also tell her how much she means to yu, and tht your life feels weird, without her in it. buh it was kind of messed up tht yu took her bestfriend to prom after she asked yu.. to make the situaution better, yu should have just went solo! buh hey we all make mistakes, now this is your chance to patch things bck up with her. i mean she must have been really hurt when yu went out with her bestfriend... i hope this advice works. try to be as gentle and mature about this situaution when yu decide to tlk to her, so tht she can see yu have became  a better person over the timeperiod, tht yu havent tlked to her.|`|wC0S3xOuaa	Honestly that's a pretty crappy thing to do to her. I don't blame her for turning you down. May be now you know what your losing . A true friend.    Having said that. If friendship is what your after and nothing more. Then do what it takes to win her over. That is , if she means that much to you. All  is not lost. But true friends are hard to find.
jYMlAN4Paa	Let me make sure I understand you:    You feel like your whole life is messed up because your parents made you go to a certain college that you didn't want to go to. Now, your whole life is messed up, you don't have any friends and you say your family is "not a family".    Well.....    Grow up.    Seriously.    You didn't have to go to that college. You could have taken a job, rented an apartment, supported yourself and put yourself through school.    Going to a university you don't want to go to doesn't ruin your life. IN fact, very few things can actually ruin your life. Your parents are not to blame......they were doing what they thought was best for you and caring about you.    You say your friends are not friends......well get off your bum and find people who can be your friends and who you get along with. You are free to be around any group of people you want to be around. And you are free to have a few friends or no friends at all. That is all in your hands....no one is to blame except yourself. You picked them.    You say your family is not a family. Do they abuse you? Do they abuse each other? are they a cult? Are they divorced? Even if they are divorced, you still have a mother and a father. Mosy people don't even have that. My father left my Mum when I was in college...he cheated on her and I knew about it because he enjoyed bragging. He then went on to get married...all the time including me into all his crap. Then, he cut me out of his life when I became ill. I have an 8 year old sister I've never met. My Mum was there for me and has been ever since. She is my family. I can choose my own family. Any of us can.    Oh yeah.....how's your health? I've been ill for the past 13 years, had to quit my job, I have no money, I can't pay my bills and I live with my Mum. I am busting my butt to live a life that I don't like but I'm tryign to make the best of it. I have three illnesses with no cures. ONe of them is multiple sclerosis. Two fiancees have dumped me because I am not healthy physically even though it is not my fault. I have no friends because they were uncomfortable around a "sick person". But that is there loss. I am making new friends, I am getting out there and I've gone back to university through online. I just finished my first quarter there and recieved all A's because I busted my rear to get my life together.    So don't say how bad your life is. There are tons of people out there worse off than you. If you want to change your life, then do it. YOu are the only one who can.|`|0O8DUzCdaa	The only person who can change your situation is you, so take some initiative and if life sucks, then fix it!|`|51cMPec2aa	unless you're the paying for the college, you're going to have to eat it up and deal with it. and if you don't think you're friends aren't friends, maybe it's time to meet new friends at the new college. it might be the new change of place you need to love your life. new situations, new people.|`|yXD7X3jZaa	Take it easy bud. Life will get better. Have you tried talking with your parents about how unhappy you are? Stay calm. These things always take time. Try and find something that you enjoy doing or something that makes you happy. Think about your options and you'll be fine.|`|amn8XQHqaa	Well I think that you should love your life. Don't go be all depressed about something. Try your best to put out all the bad stuff, and if your friends aren't friends you can go make new friends easily by doing extracurricular activities and talking to some people there.And about the collage thing, maybe if you talk to your parents about it, don't yell at them just kindly ask. And if they won't listen then maybe you could talk to someone that would help (or maybe just talk to them to get it off your mind) and maybe, just maybe they could do something about it.   Well that's all i really have to say so,   toodles~!~|`|AdX583L7aa	Stick with it  Life is wonderful  Be grateful|`|AA12137422	read this book : the savage god -A>Alvarez it'll help u alot|`|OBiej5oMaa	What you feel in your heart will make you happy....life is too short for regrets!!! Live your life for you.|`|ItaP4NKraa	Find something to accomplish in life.  Like something fun and silly, thats what i do when im feeling down.  Like MAGIC!  or street basketball or uhh making sandwiches with your feet! =D
aGOBuJtKaa	I speak to my mom just about everyday, I always tell her that I am slowly turning into her. I remember as a kid, my mom never had much money but she could make a meal out of almost anything, we never once went hungry, we were never once homeless,  my mom struggled to make sure we never lived in decent neighborhoods, and some how she made miracles happen on Christmas.|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	That's so sad, but at least you have happy memories (:    My happiest moment was the first time I saw her after all her therapy, on the day she married my stepdad. After the divorce from my dad, she turned to alcohol, lost her job as a consultant, and spent a lot of time in London getting back on track. It took years. Then she found my stepdad, and now his children live with us and it's bliss.    But yeah, my happiest moment with her was seeing her in her wedding dress just smiling, it made me cry.|`|sTH9YCRUaa	My mom and dad divorced when I was 10.  When I was 13 or so, my brother and sister were older and out of the house living their own lives and in college.  Every Sunday morning,  Mom and I would sit and watch Sunday morning TV.  (The Big Valley,  Wild Wild West,  Bonanza,  Little House on the Prairie).  I used to cuddle up with her on her recliner for hours.  I felt s0oo safe and secure...no matter how hard the outside world was becoming difficult to live in.  We both knew I was becoming too old to be sitting on mom's lap,  not to mention so heavy that her legs would fall asleep,  but she didn't complain.  This was OUR time together.  Every Sunday.  When I remember my mom,  this is the best memory.  She passed away several years ago and I always wished that I would have told her how I felt sitting on her lap and that this is my "favorite" time together.  Thank you for asking....It is good to share these things with people at times.....
M0suUkQNaa	Well, my mom passed away about a year ago, and I think the happiest thing we ever did together is probably when she would take me to the park and try to teach me how to do cartwheels. We always had a blast.|`|4suKn91qaa	Sorry bout ur mom, now that u mention it, one of the most memorable that I will remember about my mom was when I was about 9 and there was this big dog who was barking all over me and I was scared to death and how my mom hide me behind her back and protect me, u knnow I think u're right I never really realize how important my mom is until now when u mention about it...|`|dMZBrGzAaa	when my mom drop me on the hard wood floor i landed on my head.|`|e1WMNNSIaa	Wow. Thanks for making me take a moment to think about that.  I dont see my mom much anymore because I dont make the time to do it. Wow...you really got me thinking.  My mom and I always laughed over everything all the time.  I tell my mom I love her when I get off the phone with her but my mom is not that type of person.  It makes her uncomfortable.  So were you pregnant?|`|5hCEXoPbaa	i am so sorry about your mother, to help you remember all the fun times you had with your mom,  make a scrapbook with pictures, quotes ect.     my mother... :/
golF56nWaa	Cook her favorite dinner and her favorite cake.|`|mpfqoLCVaa	Most Important, don't make her realize in any manner that she is your Step Sister. I say this because you in your mind are actively concious that she is your Step Sister and that is why while typing this question you have addressed her as your Step Sister, which was not necessary. Am I right ? The best gift for her in my opinion would be your treatment of her as your Real Sister.|`|9ZvHsIFfaa	get her a takeaway meal from a restaurant , get a bottle of wine, get on yahoo answers and have fun|`|fVMzCP5raa	Get a take away and watch a movie
9a563f07110eb7d90b07edf57255e441aa	He is COMPLETELY into you. the winking means, he wants to be with you and he is thinking about asking you out... he just does the wink to see if you wink back and if you don't then you may not like him...|`|syZn0tahaa	He likes you :] The winking means he thinks your attractive!|`|D6AYSUvsaa	Yea, I believe he wants you, winking can mean a whole lot of things lol|`|6QLuXBmyaa	well the obvious answer is that he is into you...
4POGapREaa	It's not necessary for a reception to have a theme.  Beautiful flowers, a few favors, good food, and some dancing is really all that matters.  Whatever speaks to you is fine.  I like tropical things so maybe I leaned a little more towards that but it wasn't like everything had to be matchy matchy to say something about us as a couple.  Theme weddings are little strange to me.  If you happen to be obsessed with something like the beach or diving or football or gothic stuff, then that's fine because that's you.  But reaching to find a theme doesn't make sense to me.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	My daughter's name means Cherry Blossom in vietnamese. We're doing a minor cherry blossom theme. Mostly just half of the centerpieces will be of them. The other half of candles and so on. It's a pretty popular theme and looks beautiful.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Colors or Mickey Mouse Opera?  Don't do a theme unless it's like 1940's Glamor.  Colors: I personally like navy and yellow or amethyst and lime green.|`|D2xtAq8qaa	You can do any theme you want to!  Your options are truly endless.  Think about what maybe brought you and your soon to be hubby  together, music, nature then go from there.|`|nqINitkmaa	I am doing a wine themed with a rustic wine country feel, but I am getting married at a Vineyard. Other than that I can't think of any themes that would be good, I always think its tacky when I go to themed weddings, my cousin had a fairytale themed wedding, tacky tacky tacky... but its your wedding do as you please. Good Luck!|`|NyRBCufpaa	You can pick any theme that you want to for your reception. I've seen people do Nascar themes, vegas themes, chinese themes.... you can do anything with the theme.  My advice would be to research wedding theme ideas and pick something that shows a little of both of your personalities.|`|xFv6LirIaa	How about diamonds and pearls?
gK0vcdnDaa	I sure hope not!!  I'm getting married on a Friday in June.     It used to be a bad omen due to the hangings.  I haven't heard any modern day superstitions.      Good thing is that things are less expensive so I can afford "more" on the same budget.      Have fun & Good Luck!  -Elle|`|Azp6bBazaa	you need no luck as long as you have love.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I don't believe in the whole Friday is an unlucky day thing.  Most weddings are on Saturdays, but I know a few friends who got married on a friday.  Do whatever you want!  :)|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	The reason it is considered unlucky is b/c Friday was the day they did the hangings.  So as the downtown area in cities wasn't that big, (usually had a square where the church and courthouse would both have been) the bride would have come out the church and seen a dead man hanging from the gallows.    That would definitely turn me off from Fridays back then.    However it really depends on how superstitious you are.  I've known several people to get married on a Friday since it's cheaper than Saturday.  Technically Wednesday is considered the luckiest day of the week but with that was back in the day when gentleman and ladies of the upperclass would not have...*gasp* worked in a trade.  ugh.  So, it was easy to get everyone together during the week.|`|sGP6s7uraa	I've heard that Saturday is actually the most unluckiest day of the week.  I say anything goes nowadays.|`|nqINitkmaa	No, I don't believe in any of that superstition anyways, I think that the only reason they say its good luck if it rains on your wedding day is because it makes the bride feel better if its pouring on her special day. I am getting married on a friday as well! Congrats to you!!|`|YgggHhwuaa	No, and it is a great way to cut down on cost.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.    I think you are confusing the so called "Friday the 13th" bad luck day, with all Fridays.    There is NO superstition (that I know of) saying that getting married on Friday is bad luck.    Lots of couples do this.|`|X1YVUA5oaa	No, thats stupid.|`|AA12272543	Is it bad luck to get married.|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	nope kinda lucky cus you can get everything on the cheep|`|HJ0YTWjVaa	I am getting married on a Wednesday! Not because I think Friday or Saturday are bad luck. It just worked best that way for us.|`|a7364bce10f3534559a9e7a19fe16bcbaa	There's no such thing as "bad luck" or superstitions. You make your own luck. If you want to get married on a Friday, do it ... plenty of people have.
0AShsMsoaa	in my vast experience, the best way to do this is to be fully prepared and make sure everything is done and ready.  make sure your videographer and photographer know what pictures and scenes you want captured, rehearse toasts and dances, make sure everyone involved knows what is going on, and that each and every single person will be on time and do what they said they would do.  late people cause more anguish than anything.  call and confirm everything !!!  before the wedding, then, you can clear your mind to actually be present on your day.    other things to keep in mind, if you want a fully there experience, dont drink in the weeks beforehand, dont take any any any drugs of any kind before or during the event, both assure you wont remember.     be fully in the moment on your day.  go around the reception and say hello to each table.  dont just hang with your friends, go around and speak briefly to the people who came out for you.|`|H0aBhTSYaa	The day will fly by and there's nothing you can do about it.  Just try to step back and breathe and enjoy the moment as much as you can.  Time flies by so fast b/c you are trying to talk to all of your guests and handle formalities like cake cutting and first dance stuff and when you think about it, you really don't have time to talk to everyone as much as you want unless you're having 5 guests and the reception is a few hours long.  We had a small wedding (50 people) and we still didn't get to talk to everyone in a 3 hour reception.  It's nuts, but just take little moments and enjoy!|`|u0Ao9SpGaa	It does go by so fast!  I think that the best advice would be to just relax, not worry about everything.  There will be things that don't happen as planned, or something that you thought would look like this ends up looking like that.  Just don't worry about all the little details on your wedding day.  It is what it is at that point, you planned as best as you could.  Congrats!
u4910BFfaa	Yes, asking guests to pay for their food is horrible.  +    I think you and your fiancee need to come up with some money to pay for the food.  Sounds like the parents paid for other stuff.  We are paying for our own wedding 100% from dress to cake with no help at all, so I think you need to pick up the slack if you want a nicer wedding.|`|4POGapREaa	KFC is mega white trash.  Sorry.  I totally feel your pain that your plans were disrupted & changed but it's kind of your bad for relying on everyone else to front your bill.  No, I do not think it's appropriate to make his family pay for their own meal.  What is that?  A slap on the hand because they should have given you money to begin with?  If you're staying at a condo (not a hotel) then you probably have an oven, a fridge, etc.  Why not hire someone for the day to prepare some food while you're doing the ceremony?  You can get mini quiches frozen from Costco or whatever, buy good deli meats & cheeses, dips, spreads, veggies, fruits, etc.  If you can't find or can't afford someone to put that together, then pre-order from somewhere in that area & pick it up ahead of time.  A reception at your condo with decent appetizers, some cocktails, and a bit of class is really all you need.|`|nqINitkmaa	Having KFC or Guests pay for their own meals do not belong in the same sentence I am sure you can find a cheaper cater that will do a buffet style dinner for cheaper!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I would call some local caterers and get pricing for catering your after-wedding party at the condo. Save up some money and find a way to entertain your guests in style. IMHO, both options (KFC and requiring guests to pay for their meal) are fairly tacky. I would cut back on something else to provide my guests with a modest but nice meal.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	It is NOT okay to ask your guests to pay for their own meal. The reception is a party you throw for them, as a thank you for witnessing your marriage and taking the time and expense to be with you on your big day. There is nothing tackier than telling them they have to pay for their own food.    If you don't want KFC, have Italian food. Make a big pot of spaghetti, throw together some salad and garlic bread and wine, finish with cake. It's cheap and doesn't take much labor.    Otherwise, schedule your ceremony at a non-meal time (mid-afternoon or very late evening) and just serve cake and punch, maybe with a few appetizer trays.    You throw the kind of reception you can afford - you don't ask your guests to pony up for the food.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	You can't ask guests to pay for their own food.  Period.  It also would be tacky to serve KFC after an opulent display at the ceremony.  I think I'd have the ceremony at about 2:00 in the afternoon, followed by an afternoon hors d'eouvre and cocktail reception (limited cocktails--perhaps just champagne--to keep the cost of the liquor down).  Have decent hor d'eouvres and skip the meal all together.  It's not ideal, but better than the options you've provided.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Yes. You and your fiance host the meal (pay for it yourselves), and choose what you like.|`|R7b150Iyaa	It sounds like you and your fiance are not paying for the wedding.  Can the two of you pay for a nice restaurant after the ceremony?  I think having people pay for their own meals OR having KFC for your wedding reception is horrible and tacky, and people will remember this (NOT in a good way) for a long time.  Especially since you're worked hard to establish an elegant vibe with the formalwear and musician.  If that doesn't work, maybe ask your parents to loan you the money and you will pay them back afterwards?    Good luck and congrats!|`|AA10975867	Yeah, cut out the violinist, order less flowers and ask the hotel to prepare a picnic type of sandwiches/desserts/punch on the patio.|`|wLHjvTuBaa	maye go to a fancy rectraunt that is not as costful      KFC is really cheap  and your fiancemight not like it  btw u should pay  unless he offers|`|sGP6s7uraa	KFC after a formal wedding....hmmmm...not good.  If no family member (in-laws or otherwise) is willing to pay for the dinner, I would say do not do KFC and have people pay for their own meal at a nice restaurant. OR have the 'rents pay for half of the bill and you and your husband pay the other half.  Don't do KFC.  You'll regret it. If there is no other option, check out buffets and see if you can rent a PRIVATE room and split the cost there.|`|7G4hisdzaa	If your wedding is scheduled at a mealtime, I would change the time.  Do it at 3pm, or sunset, and make sure the hours don't interfere with mealtimes.  I think this is your most effecient way of cutting food costs.  I don't know the guest count, but if you do this, you can have low-cost food alternatives.  Even if it's a cheese and grape tray and sparkling cider from walmart you are beating KFC!    I'm saving tons on my reception food, and feeding 125 guests for $500.  And I'm talking good shrimp, stuffed mushrooms, cake, small sandwiches, etc.  If you need more help email me I'll be happy to pitch ideas!  Good luck...and skip the KFC.|`|HQsmRzPsaa	i think asking people to pay for their dinner is in bad taste. especially if they are traveling from far. ok, so your parents are not willing to pay for this. PAY FOR IT YOURSELF!|`|zaSyEcnqaa	I agree with the suggestions to change the time of day and have a dessert reception.   No KFC- sorry, but that is tacky.  Also, guests should not pay for their own meals.     So sorry your plans are being interrupted.   Can't you and your fiance contribute financially?|`|K2MjQFdNaa	Hello!    After reading your issue, I have thought a lot about my own wedding taking place in September.  However, it is not a destination wedding as your own....of course, that makes it a little more difficult to please everyone.  Remember, it's your wedding!  Who is control?     I think some people have missed the fact, when giving you advice, they did not catch that you are having a reception when you return.  I see nothing wrong with going out for a nice dinner after your wedding on the beach, and yes, having everyone cover their own cost....just make sure you are upfront about it.  I assume some of these same people will be attending the reception when you return at no cost to them.    Another option would be to check out some local restaurants and see if they can deliver something to your condo.  Clearly, Italian would provide the most food at a decent cost.  Also, ask your fiance to ask his family for help with expenses such as this.....it does not hurt to ask.    I hope this helps!  Best Wishes for you and your groom!!
AA11796667	I got married at city hall and what we did was the lady follows us outside where there was this big Oak tree and we did the ceremony there under that old oak tree and it was just us and one of our friends it was nice!|`|AA11334468	You can be alone in the room with just your witnesses|`|c2uywBsIaa	prolly one at a time like they do here at our courthouse.  They make each group wait in the hall and do one at a time.|`|8c93b08d0ef73b87abf803c1344c16e1aa	Call the courthouse, young lady. Make sure someone can 1) carry out the ceremony at the municipal level - it may be the county that's necessary, and 2) can you get a private ceremony. Best wishes!!!|`|RHGMg650aa	I think there will be other marriages too but if want a separate room for your self . I think you have to pay extra but you can find out from the office who run that place
dPyfP0ijaa	I know your situation, I was in several abusive relationships and I kept going back to the guy. I'm a girl btw, almost 30. I know you love him and all that crap, but you need to love yourself more.     If he loved you he wouldn't lay the guilt trip on you, he should have never gotten out of hand to the point he was arrested.    It's NOT your problem to pay his bail, but I see it's a crap situation since he won't pay your shared bills now.     Honey, It's only going to get worse. He's never gonna change. Do you really want to live with these problems all your life?? I see you are more responsible, you probably have a job. What are you gonna do if you get pregnant? Do you really want to have babies with a loser??     How could he take care of you if he can't take care of himself>??    I know its not what you want to hear, but to answer your question, you shouldn't have to pay. If you stay with him, you'll end up paying anyway . .. get it?    Dump the loser, you can find a way better awesome guy.    It took me years but now I have a great guy, we have our differences, but he takes care of me and my kids and loves me unconditionally.    I only wish the same for you.|`|VMY7No0eaa	DO NOT BAIL HIM OUT THE 2ND TIME.    Don't allow him to put a guilt trip on him... if the cops didnt' think he should be removed then they would have just talked to him    RUN RUN RUN FAST AS THE WIND.|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	Why are you still with him? The was arrested for battery against YOU.  You admit he has anger issues yet you stay with him after he's "damaged" you.    Don't pay, and get out.|`|7e7e66e61bc00173161b8dc44d25b035aa	Blah.....    Why on earth are you still willing to call this douchebag of a felon your boyfriend?    Here's a hint....start by dating someone who, you know, doesn't beat you when he gets angry.    (Oh....and if it isn't already painfully obvious, NO...YOU SHOULDN'T PAY HIS SISTER!!!!)    Sheesh.|`|7PGxqRfZaa	Tell his loser to be a man and pay is own bills. What kind of loser are you dating. What ever floats your boat lady.Good luck|`|0AShsMsoaa	you arent very ladylike, are you?      his !!!  anger problem?  that is funny.      questions from your side of the tracks are always so entertaining.|`|v53eCpPkaa	he sounds dangerous.you should end contact but he may continue to bug you for a bit. don't get into another fight,or accuse him. he'll use it as excuse. keep it all as brief as possible and don't take the bait if he says outrageous things.just get off the phone.dont give him an chance to hurt you.if necessary let the police know what's going on!!!!you may need protection.     i hope you can take the experience as a lesson and choose positive partners in future, be peaceful with yourself, take good care of yourself. good luck
yhgRaBPXaa	it never hurts to dream, but you will more than likely change your mind by then|`|0Id85yiYaa	it's ok to dream about your wedding. there are tons of people who do this.|`|TiIzwLUIaa	of course not all girls have dreams you know the other day i believe it was the wedding channel and they had a gothic wedding in a cemetery it was strange but different   and very unique  keep you eyes out maybe the will play it again ..|`|dCmSA6r2aa	its not bad just senseless  goth's don't go to the beach   there might not even be such a thing as a goth when you are ready to marry  and you might not be one then so it would be a waste of time|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Do whatever makes you happy and ignore the naysayers. There's nothing wrong with dreaming but keep in mind that your plans will change when you do become engaged and you need to take his input into consideration as well since it is also his day, even though many here say it isn't.     You sound like you would fit right in at the Tribe at www.offbeatbride.com . The ladies there are very helpful with ideas and open to things that are outside the box.|`|MeGazyy7aa	I want a gothic wedding too! I know that this sounds weird but I want to get married in a cemetery like place.    I've never really thought about it until someone asked me, and that was my response. I don't have a bf either and I don't think anyone would ever want to marry me anyways.|`|1179ac1ef69ec53031ff43e46bee7a38aa	Sounds like a fun and harmless fantasy to me. But, when the time comes to plan a real wedding, you may want to take into consideration the other person's wishes.|`|c71316f440c7c102ff8ab9c606b89e49aa	"Life moves pretty fast.

There will be plenty of time to plan later.|`|42752ab4ab20a3852a93491c98fdff11aa	No its not bad to plan your dream wedding at such a young age.  The majority of young girls do.  Haven't you seen the little bride make believe costumes sold in stores?  You are okay dont worry.|`|7CKipTZOaa	As long as the planning process doesn't majorly distract you from school and your studies (I know I sound like an old maid heh) then go for it, but don't be surprised if your dream wedding considerably changes over the years I know mine did, and the wedding my fiance and I are planning now is nothing like what I had in mind when I was 13 but I adore everything we've picked out so far|`|hs5kKoNwaa	no, it's not bad. it's okay to dream. but don't take it to seriously, things in life change constantly, you might not get to have your dream 'Goth on the beach' wedding. Trust me, right now you want to have a goth wedding on the beach, but when you get older you'll probably change your mind, sometimes styles of the time can affect your decisions too. Plus, when you get a boyfriend, if he isn't goth then you probably won't have a goth wedding.|`|W58zAH8waa	Hi. Please do not take this the wrong way or anything, but I would not plan your wedding and get your hopes high because your husband might not be into that idea. I am not saying do not do it, because it is your special day. I bet when your wedding comes, it will be GREAT!
FiCl71flaa	After three years of liking someone you still have not said anything to the person. Yet you feel like he is your boyfriend and should not flirt with anyone else  because you are flirting with him and he is smiling at you and lets you into a game and so on. Have you stopped to think that he is just a nice guy , or likes you but not in a romantic fashion,  or that he can not read your mind. If you  truly like him (I know you say you did for 3 years), all you have to do is tell him. After all this time you guys at least say hi to each other;pick a time and place to talk in private, smile ,tell him how you feel and have felt for three years, and ask him if he feels for you as  more than just a friend. his response will let you know how he feel about you and also what you next move should be.Remember that he can not  read your mind, you have to tell him how you feel. Only then will you know what your next move should be.|`|OOzadIJFaa	well if hes rejected you then he's just a flirt|`|6YahjgpSaa	China would be proud of that wall.|`|DFw8TSmMaa	Maybe he's just not that into you and just likes to flirt. I know it's hard to hear but you have to consider every possibility.|`|mHZvOhsDaa	maybe he not sure if you like him.. make it clear.     if you dont want to do that hint at it like..    hey we known eachother for 3 years now, do you want to hang out sometime after school?!    hope it helps.. if your sure he staring at you than he has you on his mind. be the man in this case because he is obviously afraid of rejection. cant blame him, every1 fears it but its something you must accept in life. hope i helped.|`|9vbiZNLtaa	well.... you know its kind of hard to tell cause i dont know what kind of a guy he is? if he is a smart,nice kid he probably likes you but he trys not to show it to much because hes afraid of acting stupid in front of you....i know thats how i was|`|e81B9pDKaa	He could lyke u and he could just be messing with u. I have a guy friend he's in my pe and math class. He's really cute and funny and I lyke him. I always make flirty faces to him and smile at him and we joke around ALOT. Somedays I think he lykes me and other days I don't. I found out he was just messing with me. If he rejected u three times then he definately doesn't like you. The best thing may be to just move on.|`|jSkspBomaa	it sounds like hes being a jerk..go ask him what his problem is lol  can u plz answer mine plz (check my profile)|`|yut7x1b9aa	oh. it sounds like he totally likes u. just playing hard to get;) but 2 can play that game;)|`|44707e7b798fd01392ccb15cec3384afaa	ask him if he would like to eat lunch together i know corny but it will work|`|1e8bdb2c5237f63206d04801a77dea6daa	Maybe he just wants to be friends (there's a first time for everything I guess).|`|TyNBicevaa	Well, first how old are you? Second, it sounds like he likes you. Boys are very unpredictable. Have you asked him out, or has he asked you out?|`|UT25fWaZaa	Stop playing around and tell him u want to hook up.  Then u will find out all your answers.|`|m0odE0Ouaa	tell him you really like him and you would like to go out with him, if he likes you then he will accept. if hes rejected you that many times then maybe you should stop looking at him. he will surely miss it if he cares about you and then he will show it, sometimes to make him do the right thing you have to pretend he no longer exists. its sad but it works that way...
2wOmBTPyaa	You blush when you're embarrassed, when you're proud of what you do or stop caring what people think of it then you won't blush when you tell people.

Are you like auctioning off sex on Ebay or something?|`|sAEpRinVaa	well, I would blush too, that's way bigger than "doing" the football team.|`|4b04RLMLaa	you can't really control it because it is blood flowing through your face and maybe if you don't think of it, you won't blush|`|OdUZ7NNnaa	embarrasment and heat  you cant    stop saying ebay !  duh ..|`|UI79JnJVaa	"When a Lady sneaks in close enough,   just to where the tip of her nose almost   touches mine, while she's smiling, is   going to have me blushing every time."

j6pqXCh9aa	It depends on where you guys will be stationed.  First I think that AIT is 8 weeks and as far as your vehicles the military will only pay for one  vehicle to be shipped. As far as time off your husband will have to put in for leave time. And also if your husband's unit is due to deploy he will have to leave with his unit, unfortunately that's how it is.  But you make sure that he sets everything in order before he leaves.  Make sure that you have 2 powers of attorney, one general power of attorney and a special. Because there are a lot of things  you won't be able to do if he is not with you without those 2 pieces of paper. And yes the army will pay for travel orders for you. Good Luck to you.  Go Army|`|ljwJr6u8aa	I don't think they pay for it. you may want to sell or park the cars at a friends or family members house and rent one.they will probably give you a place to stay in a housing unit.
2vaGZ4eDaa	Yeah, sounds like a great, creative idea.  My 25th is about 4 years away...mind if I borrow that?|`|bf6c8c12038a0925b13989b7791d0d0caa	It sounds like you two had fun. Yes I think I would do something like that. Thanks for the idea.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Oh..... no.  lol    I'm single and too many people know who I am in this one horse town.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I think it is great!

zW67wcRVaa	DON'T DO IT!  You will never be able to be friends with Sara again...|`|hwIMJBVpaa	nothing...you do nothing. its not your place to get in the middle of it. even if she breaks up with him its not a good idea for you to go after him. havent you heard of this rule before? i doubt that girl is your best friend because you wouldnt be doing that.|`|2wOmBTPyaa	Just be make conversation and be like so "How are you and Sara doing?"     And then just go from there.  Good Luck (:|`|uwoFso71aa	while he is dating "sara" he is off bounds, if he dumps her and all than he is open, but make sure you ask "sara" if it is ok if you do. you want to minimize the drama while you can|`|SVW83UERaa	NONONO  trust me never hook up with a friends boyfriend ,not only will you ruin your friendship with her other people who hear will have different View of you(most likely a bad one)   maybe hook up in like two three months time after you've asked her     good luck :)|`|ZNwV73Y0aa	stay away from her boyfriend. its not worth losing a friend over.  and even if he does break up with her, theres a golden rule that a girl will never go with a friends ex
WDs4fRoxaa	He is attracted to you and mistook your kindness for love.    He is not going to forget about you until he has a new  person to treat him the way you did.    The sad part is that he will probably mistake that person's  intentions as well.    Best wishes|`|517722e044003718f8f92512815e4c2eaa	love?|`|mXq6Uk6Baa	i think that the treatment isn't working, you need to get more information about this matter, this is just one of to much problems that you will need to get on on your profession, and i think that you are to pretty, to take his old problem out, and stay in his mind, instead his old "love". be care full maybe he is dangerous.  good luck pretty girl.
RtkB46peaa	He's full of horse manure.  Make your move, and he'll either respond or he won't.  As long as you don't force him, what's the problem?  He's a big boy.|`|asxqampCaa	You can't find one goddamned room in the entire city with two beds in it?    HORSESHIT.    Ask for a cot and sleep on that.    Both of you = dying to screw like hungry tigers.|`|IvMPh09baa	Are you serious??? Come on... nobody on here is that stupid.  No job would require you to share a hotel room with one bed... seriously... so lame due.. And if you are self employed, maybe you should build your business up more before taking "business" trips" in which require you to stay in 1 bed... thats not even professional... im curious what kind of clients you have.|`|AA10436595	...........and I know what the project will be.  (and so do you)|`|zDeFibxzaa	yeah im with ruth,someones setting somebody up with this thing.they supposed to give each one a bed if not a seperate room altogether. lol   it sounds a little fishy somewhere along the line|`|u1uECuFNaa	Oh, please.  If he is not wanting it, I think he is being polite.   In other words, he does not want you.|`|AA11967247	theres no rational reason 2 people would go on a business trip and share a bed for 5 days. this doesnt even   make sense.    *then spend the extra $, get two rooms and save yourself the grief. your causing your own fustration.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	First of all, are you married?  Respect him.  You can't expect him to give into you just because you are horny.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	You are either making this up, or you are working for a very, very bad company. No company I ever heard of would force two unmarried people to share a room, much less a bed.    AND you should respect him for trying to do the right thing and keep your moves in your pocket. Better yet, don't go on the business trip at all. You mind is clearly not on business.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	This has disaster written all over it.    If he doesn't want a relationship with you, then why is he only getting one room for the two of you?  If you have the desire for him there is no way you can spend five nights together with him without that feeling coming to the front.  It is possible for unmarried people to be platonic together but it is difficult and unrealistic, especially when one of them is feeling a lot more than platonic friendship.  He obviously cares about you or he would not have arranged such a trip.    I think you should insist on two rooms for a business trip.  That is the right thing to do.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	This is ridiculous.  lol    Somebody's kidding somebody here.    You might not consider it a joke, but I do.  And that is my final answer.  lol
ClK9W8THaa	It's always nice to be close to your boyfriend and to be honest with him about things that needs to be shared.  But it's never a good thing when a girl tells her boyfriend all of her girlfriends sacred secrets and personal information.  It saids alot about her character and it feeds him bad information about you.  Not to mention that it also can back fire on her as well.. Because guys will try to talk to his girlfriends, friends because now he's gotten the juice on her.  So no one wins here.  I had a friend who did the same thing to me and she was fired after her show.  Meaning, i did not tolerated that and i told her so and that was the end of our relationship.  That's a no no.  So with out further or do,  Just tell her that's not kool and if she does it again then leave her where you met her (alone). Just that simple.  It's just  not a kool thing.  Good luck to you. Hope everything turns out for you.  And another thing, learn to stop telling all of your business to your friends. That's not kool either.  Folks love to hear about gossip and pain.  If they don't hear it from you then how would they know.  So learn to tell people what you want them to know not everything you know, ok|`|JlDcVTVsaa	I dont think you can make her stop doing that,   you have 2 choices:  1. dont tell her any thing  2. when you are telling her some thing, know that she will tell him, and ask her to tell him not to tell anyone.
NvW6voPJaa	Hi and congratulations!    I would combine  1 (free) the mirror circle with two tea lights AND  3 - the potted orchids.      Put the potted orchid in the center of the mirror tile with the tea lights on either side.|`|YuYSL0A2aa	I like the first option best, mirrored candles are gorgeous.|`|Mn1HTfqaaa	I really like option two! I know it was just suggested to another poster but I think there is such a thing as purple hydrangeas, you could do something simple with that (they are huge, so it would only take one or two... you could do purple and white!) Or, you could take the purple ones and some long twig/branch things, spray paint them white and silver...like this    http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jwGBQc597EU/SK...    Other thoughts: you could add something to the venue's offering... not exactly sure what it looks like, but you might be able to add something for a very low cost.     Calla lilies also come in deep purple and white; those are some beautiful flowers as well.     and finally, this is a very pretty solution:  http://www.rivierahotelchapel.com/flower...    Good luck!|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Option 4: Why not do a cool purple centerpiece with a black ribbon? There are so many cool flowers out there. Here are some cool dahlias:    http://www.dahlias.com/index.asp?PageAct...|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I think you should go with the mirrors and tea lights from the venue, but spice it up with some additional pieces!  Here are some ideas:    http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/H...    http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/H...    http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/H...    If you like the look or ornaments, you could use the bowl idea and instead of fruit, you could use different colored ornaments in your color scheme.  That would be easy and you could send them home with people to reuse!|`|bnhp1pxAaa	You can do the candle centerpiece with your initials on them. Create your own.  Go to website below and click on my design tool.  You can choose from over 30 colors.  Also, check out the about me page.  Scroll to the bottom and check out my photos.  If you need any other ideas, email through my website.|`|gzzgeX3Aaa	I would combine  1 and  4. I would take the mirror and tea lights and then in the middle put 2 giant hydrangeas . It's classic yet different  slightly unexpected.
wpi36XBAaa	That would depend on a lot of factors.  1. This is the biggest - Is there $20.00 left over after all the essentials are paid for? that includes putting something aside for the regular bills that come in, but may not be due this week.  2. Is part of the reason for your partner not wanting you to spend the $20 because you are not meeting the debts owed because of other of your indulgences?   If the first two apply then perhaps $20 is just not reasonable.  3. Is that the only and whole amount that you have spent on yourself during that period? I would include purchasing cigarettes and alcohol for yourself, going out, etc as personal indulgences, not household expenses.  4. Does your partner spend money on themselves? Equal to or more than what you do?  If these do apply then you need to talk to your partner and ask why you shouldn't be able to have some spending money when they can.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	If it means that your family won't have enough food, yes, it is selfish.|`|hs793CCxaa	Make up a budget - see if it will allow you both some spending money each week. Even if it only allows $5, you can save to get to $20.     There are solutions to most things in marriage, you just have to look for them - preferably together, as two minds are better than one.|`|GvamTVqAaa	depends on how much you make, how much your bills are, what's left over after bills, and what's going on in your life.    If you don't have much $20 may be VERY selfish.|`|e1b44601c9cee963123690929c7f64b2aa	depends on what you are buying ?|`|IvMPh09baa	depends on if all the bills are taken care of first.  You are married now, and a roof and heat matter much more than whatever you are going to spend that $20 on.... at least in my opinion.  I'd much rather use that $20 to pay my electricity bill and get heat when I come home versus look good in a new top.|`|m81dfyOYaa	Why have you allowed your partner to have such a tight rein on the finances that you can't spend $20? If it's your mother you're talking about, well that's a different story. Mother knows best, my mother always said that to shut us up.|`|A9q3h6Lyaa	you go spend your 20.00 man. what the hell is the sense in working our asses off all day if we get no enjoyment from the fruits of our labour.
seMpUL8Kaa	You got yourself into this. Why did you even do that? You sound like a stalker. Nothing you can do accept hope that he doesn't spread the word about your antics!|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	That border line stalking. Just leave him alone. Find someone else, by posing as his friend you've officially made sure he's not coming back.|`|1vZ1n0agaa	how do you imitate the opposite gender well? if you didn't why would you try lol    just play it down, laugh it off, make it like 'hah i almost got you' instead of 'omg im so sorry!' because it's not that big a deal|`|IM9bk1YMaa	:o    Your NOT a stalker. Lol    Just tell him that your sorry, and you just like him and cant help but want to talk to him? or something.    I used to follow the guy I liked around school...  Then he got annoyed and told me to p*ss off.   Atleast you didnt do that XD    Take care x
i4ceTwqLaa	This sounds like great fun!!!    But wouldn't it be so much MORE fun if the girls got to dress up as Dads?     Maybe "Dads BBQ night" (something men LOVE to do) where all the females dress up as boys, spit, talk about sports and brag about how great their meat flipping skills are....
NEw5dsJlaa	My advice is to not be so judgemental. You admittedly don't know the people in the class, but you're pointing them out as weird. You've got some intense self esteem issues like all high schoolers, situations like this build your character and combat that shy mentality, and force you to mature socially.|`|9fc331c0fd7ac7fcec90f1ed63b96b79aa	Might be good for your development to team up with some people whom you wouldn't pick right off the bat. Life is much more complex than high school & once you've mastered getting along with all kinds of people, it will be way easier into adulthood dealing with others. Keep in mind I'm not telling you to go against some of your judgment, but do go out on a limb. You never know what you might find...  it is OK to make friends outside your own grade.   Tip: Find someone to share a thought. Find a photo that you liked. Or ask someone why they picked a particular object or certain angle/lighting. You know, talk shop !|`|wuBIF9aPaa	sounds like your the weird person (sorry if i sound mean)   aren't you supposed to be in school to learn not talk?   get over yourself

df9f7cedfb85f18f6689c6f840f93cbfaa	Wow this is a serious problem. It could be because he is holding a rage inside. It could be because you fight over stupid stuff. He might love you and have some control issues. Do not withhold sex unless it is the night you are arguing that night. Stop apologizing even when your wrong. Leave him alone and don't talk to him at all. don't make him dinner or his laundry. Put his dirty stuff in a trash bag in the closet. keep the house clean that is for you. The next time you are talking ask if he wants a divorce. If he says yes let him have it. But only When you are working and can take care of yourself. Don't go for alimony. Go for child support if you have kids. Make it reasonable don't put him in the poor house. By not doing that it will make you a better person. Good luck|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Put an ultimatum to him. Reveal thy problem, demonstrate a solution or this is where it will go. For the love of King and Country, rally your troops woman!|`|DlCcFu1eaa	Guys hate to argue. Guys hate to argue! Guys hate to argue! Get it?    Stop arguing over everything. Is the stuff you're arguing about really that important? If i had to live with someone that I had to argue with more than once in a blue moon I'd get out of there fast. And, if I lived with someone that used withholding sex as a method of trying to manipulate me I'd be gone as well.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	They do not like feeling henpecked or nagged. Yes, it stinks when you cannot get a communication breakthrough.  I recommend thinking of all the things you love about him and think about reasons to get over some of the stuff bugging you.  Otherwise it festers and eventually, divorce is the way out.    Keep a list of the pros.  Don't keep a list of the cons.  jmo    Does it really matter who apologizes first?  I think it's perhaps more important that the apology is specific to the hurt and is sincere.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	Just act happy after you argue and he gets like that. tell him thank you honey real sweet like. then say I know you are not saying anything to me because you know I am right. I know you love me!|`|XawBWMQraa	possibly he's depressed? cheating? loss interest?    Ask him why he is withdrawn? If he's unresponsive, there isn't really much you can do, unless observe him and try to really figure out what the real underlying problem is.     exploring those options may possibly gave u ideas where the real root of the problem is and how to address it.

Haha Just kiddenXD    okay here is the moral of the story you cant make someone like you, and dont change yourself ever. I'd say start off as friends.

The best thing to do is be confident, keep telling yourself that there is some one out there for you who is perfect, amazing and GORGEOUS.     have u ever seen a really fat ugly person walking down the street with her kids and husband? ... thats living prove that everyone is perfect for someone else.      im sorry i couldnt actually tell you anything to change, but i hope that helped a little|`|9VikHGTYaa	-clothes  +push up bras|`|mXq6Uk6Baa	start to enjoy the life like if they do not exist, and they will come like bees, every one want to be With an happy person.  but don't worry you are to young, just be happy.  good luck.|`|YwaZMnnGaa	how bout growing older.|`|Fa6eAG6Taa	when you find out, tell me lol.

ZfleGhXLaa	All weddings are different.  My wedding had no Groom/Mother dance because there was no mother of the groom.  However at the end of the Father/Daughter dance we had a second song selected, invited others on to the dance floor, and the groom danced with my mother.  I would say that the couples first dance as husband and wife is most important, and the Father/Daughter dance is probably more expected and noticed than the Groom/Mother dance because all eyes (and cameras) are always on the bride.|`|PBdPD748aa	i have only ever heard of a father daughter dance - never of a mother groom dance until yahoo! so i really wouldnt worry too much at all - the father walks the bride down the isle etc and it really is just tradition. there should be no worry at all - all eyes on the bride!!|`|X6YY0OS6aa	I don't think that is a problem..well, at least I hope it isn't since I am having a fauther/daugther dance but my fiance' and his mother refuse to do a son/mother dance.|`|ldbS2ddFaa	No two weddings are the same. Don't worry about it, it's YOUR day!|`|66393fcb8deb9226aa9427ed74300258aa	That depends on the bride and groom. They can choose to do whatever they want, it is their wedding. If they do not want a groom/mother dance, then they won't have it. If anyone comments about it, just say that they didn't want to be out there alone. If it's because one or both of them are shy, have your groom pick out a special song to dedicate to her at some point during the evening and they can dance together to it along with everyone else dancing with them. That way, they still have a special dance but don't have to deal with everyone staring at them.|`|1oY8zV6Caa	I'm a Chicago wedding DJ and we come across this quite often.  As long as the mother of the groom is made aware prior to the wedding you shouldn't have any problems.  If you have a good DJ he should be able to transition things smoothly so no one even notices.  I hope this helps.  Best of luck to you!    P.S. I attached a list of Father/Daughter songs in case you're still seaching.    http://www.chicago-dj.net/2009/02/top-40...
Ikd9cppcaa	Have your Mom rent a hospitality room at a hotel. Then invite your friends for swimming in the indoor pool. Your Mom can have pizza, soda, brownies, cake and ice cream for everyone in the hospitality room. Your other plan is too much work. Some of the kids won't be interested so they won't bother coming to your birthday. Keep it simple.
PBdPD748aa	no sorry but what i do know is that all their gowns - new and old are all on their website    www.maggiesottero.com    I am getting a maggie sottero dress also - they are absolutely stunning her dresses!    Now what i would do is go on the website, every dress has a 'name' so to speak, mine is 'Carla'. Find that name as your reference when you enquire about it.    see if you can contact the designer head office direct and ask where this dress is available, or find out online who locally retails the maggie sottero brand and ask them and they will order it in for you. sometimes the stores wont have it physically there but they can order in practically anything from their available range.    Good luck, gotta love dress shopping!|`|fUBWB88laa	It already has. But for a specific gown you'd have to call the store and ask them to order it in for you. Not every store carries every Maggie Sottero gown.|`|W58zAH8waa	http://www.tietheknotbride.com/_e/dept/4...          Please visit this link. It is their website. You should look.

Knowing that, don't expect her to change if you take her back...in fact, you should expect that she will be EXACTLY the same or worse, and that if you take her back, it is YOU who decides to condone her behavior and that she is not at fault at that point.    Hope that helps.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	she may feel bad for that. she may have thought about how much her life was messed up before. she may have changed. I would go slow and use condoms if you choose to try it again. guard your heart.|`|XTBlOf9baa	You asked this same question 2 hours ago. It's the same answer.    What drugs? Drugs for a miscarriage? That's bull. When a woman has a miscarriage, most of the time, the miscarriage happens naturally within the body, and no medical treatment is needed whatsoever. Occasionally a D&C procedure is needed, which basically removes the passed fetus from the uterus. I can't think of any drugs that she would take for a miscarriage that could possibly affect her mood whatsoever. She's a liar.|`|54LoXZzpaa	yea, that chick has issues.. u need too change ur cell number.. tell her your with someone else..|`|lGdzb8aqaa	don't fall for her line, she knows that you once really cared for her, so she wants to use you again, do not fall for any tricks that she will pull no matter how much you still care tell her to leave you alone, you have answered your own feelings about her so you know the ugly truth, you must be a hell of a guy and you should have moved on by now to a woman who does want to be with you, do not go back to this woman, and think about drugs and hiv, among other drugs and problems.you do not want her, even to babysit your plastic dog. run as fast as you can,|`|7cjqT33Baa	Run Forrest, Run!!  You don't want to waste your life on someone with that many issues.|`|AA10211580	I'm gonna give you some constructive advice. You can consider what I say- it's up to you.  If you're ready to let her go, you can:    1) Block her phone number from your home phone/cell phone or change your phone number.  2) Block her email address so you no longer receive any emails from her.  3) If she writes letters to you, do not even open up her letters, just "return to sender" and pop it back in the mail box.    Since you blocked her, you will no longer receive anything from her and it will force her to move on with her life and since you do not hear from her anymore, it will give you a peace of mind.    Good luck.|`|11FQyeakaa	run and run fast you are her plan "B" Dont be her plan B and dont believe her~!|`|GLz2sX28aa	You didn't ask a question.  I will assume you want to know whether or not to take her back.  Well, NOOOOO!  Don't do it.  She says she's back to normal and she wants you.  Don't forget, she is a LIAR. Hello!  I'm afraid all drug addicts are liars because they hide their bad habit from others.    Can you EVER trust her?  Think not.  Put a whole lot of gone between her and you.  If you feel betrayed but you still care for her, that's okay.  But you can't allow her to call you all of the time because she will think that you want her too.  If you respond in anger, she will think you're just mad and that you'll forgive her, too.    It's best to be strong, calm and kind when you tell her that you have to move on.  that things will never work between you two.  Wish her well.  Tell her that you hope that she will get clean and have a happy life.   Then change your number.

TShsb3EXaa	'He/She's a good un'. It would seem to be a shorter version of 'A Good One' like a previous answerer has suggested.  I think it means that your a good person to be around and all and they get a good vibe from you.  So what if people think your simple? So, you make the guy laugh its not like he is taking the 'mick' out of you.  Be yourself, If someone doesn't like you..

ZjQqssHqaa	im sry but ur question is not clear or in the sense not proper|`|Hzf3QK9faa	Grace, people marry for a lot of different reasons. I am thankful every day that I do love my husband and he does love me. It is easy to look in from the outside and judge that you don't think they are really in love. Unless you are one of the two parties in the marriage then I do not believe you can really know and understand what all goes on between the couple enough to know how they really feel for each other. My best advise for anyone with these thoughts about a couple would be to pray for them if you are concerned about it all.

You should fly kick him in the face or the balls, submission him, or knock him out, try doing a near naked neck choke, or omaplata arm bar or somthing.|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	hes selfish|`|DtIcDLTcaa	well someone is selfish and it is not you!|`|tGs2jgxKaa	well i think it is good that you are taking care of the baby but i think fro his perspective that if you dont have a job and isnt making money to contribut then i think is why he called you selfish not theat you are|`|bYU77eteaa	Well do you have a job?   That might make a big difference  If you are working and raising your child then you are not being selfish in asking him to give up some of his hobby time to help out  If you are just sitting around taking care of the baby (im sorry but look at all the single mothers out here) you could be doing more AS WELL  He needs to understand that he has a child and he needs to re-prioritize his time.  You do too|`|om2lE7jfaa	you are right in believing he should devote some time, more like most of the time to you and his daughter. He obviously isn't mature enough to realize marriage and parenthood is a 2 part relationship. He needs to realize with being a parent you have responsibilities, and while being at a job to make money and support your family is acceptable, ditching them to go have fun is not.... If he dosnt take responsibility soon then his little girl will grow up thinking daddy had beptter things to do than help raise her. Maybe you should let him read this. its harsh but true.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	Just becauseyou have a chidl with him does not make him always right and this is not what you want. i would just find a lawyer and make him pay support and be doen with it. you are not inlove with him and hes not in love with you either its very obvious. yes kids do sometimes make a difference but not in his eyes and therefore all you need from him is support and that is all. i would go and get it and forget him and the wedding this is not going to be good after several weeks of his moving around playing it would even be worse with living with the jerk. that childshould not besubjected to that. you know you can still give this baby up for adoption and it can have a good home with two parents and you could move on also i know its hard decidsion but sometimes we have to do this for the baby not ourselves and it would be good for both of you there are open adoptions and all sorts of things.|`|mhk5yYGwaa	well he is a jerk and jealous cause you are more unselfish then he is. But healthy relationships have there ups and downs. my mom is a relationship therapist and she always says. the ups and downs make it a love rollercoster. he may have just been frustrated and really didn't mean it. you know how it is when you say something you didn't mean.|`|3QIoa38Naa	So first you let this guy f&^* you.  Then you actually have his baby?  And now you're standing around while he goes and does this stupid hobby?    You're not selfish, just stupid.|`|vJP6yTy3aa	why are you still marrying him?  sounds like a schmuck.  get child support, and let him spend time with his music.|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	Girl, you are definately NOT being selfish. It's his DAUGHTER. His time should be dedicated to her. That's what fathers are for. They make sacrifices for what's best for their child...and I think that seeing her father is definately best for her, don't you. And, you're getting married! It's not your responsibility to raise the child on your own...you guys are going to become one...it's not like your even a single mother. It should make you sad because it's a sad situation, and you are totally right.|`|FOdBeBUTaa	My stepdaughter has the same exact problem.    You are not selfish, but you need to remember, neither is he.    If he is seriously about to "take the plunge" then you need to let him have those last few weeks/months of man behavior.  It's just the way it goes.     He is enjoying what he can while he can.  Give him a chance to be the man you want him to be and I am sure he will do fine.|`|lWuZR8wBaa	Well, you only want to be with your daughter, while he is also trying to balance turning what he loves into a real career so he can eventually support you staying at home while working at something he enjoys, so I get where he's coming from.  You obviously both need to have a talk about your future plans and how you want to balance things, though, especially since you're marrying a musician. :)|`|ZJdTT4Opaa	no offense or anything but he's a jerk! i mean ya the dude needs his space but you need help to raise a child. your not selfish hunnie! he is! if your about to get married then he should start getting used to being with you for the REST OF HIS LIFE!! he should enjoy being with his newborn and his fiance! maybe he's just nervous or something.... give him awhile a come to his censes and then try to talk to him again.  i wish you the best of luck with your so to be family!! :D|`|qMdRIdiqaa	You are right and he is a bone head, love is blind marriage is and eye opener so if you can look close, you are already doing 95% of the parenting and more than like the same in taking care of your beautiful daughter, you should reconsider the marriage thing you deserve much better and so does your daughter. P.S. cu-dos to you for having your baby and taking care of her!
b553da45b259fca50eed89cd57ec9ca6aa	I'm sure people have, that's usually where that small failure rate on most any bc comes into play... usually when I've thought I was... I gave it a while, waited, sweated, and took the test.. and wasn't.. though there are all kinds of hidden things that can reduce the effectiveness of almost any BC and that's like cough syrup, antibiotics, etc..     My method of choice is depo, it doesn't work for anyone.. but one shot every three months.. and I don't have to worry about it.. plus, for me, I have an added bonus some women don't have.. no cycles when I'm on it.. or for about a year after I stop it!  That's how my angel was conceived...  silly me was late on getting my depo shot, but still had not yet had a cycle.. how could I get pregnant right? LOL.. turns out she was just meant to be here! :)  I did spot during my pregnancy with her, but it was from her placenta trying to detach.. Thank God it didn't..     My mom got pregnant with me when she was on the pill and my dad used a condom.. go figure!   Or at least that's what she says ;~)     My cuz's wife got pregnant after having a tubal.. yep.. even the dr was amazed, when she had the "second" tubal he said the ties were even still on there from the first.. that he didn't know how it happened..     There's nothing fool proof except abstinence and then there's always that immaculate conception. right? haha.. :)      I'll tell ya, my thoughts are sure with ya and wondering if you're expecting after this q!!!!  Please keep us posted!  (((((((((Pure))))))))))))|`|8RNPlSAfaa	OH  the first yahoo baby!!!!    It'll get 100% BA from me!!    and to your question...

xrLE3Ytgaa	It sounds like to me that the reason you don't like this guy is because this is the first time your mom is dating another man. Or maybe not? I don't know, u didn't put alot of info and I didn't understand half of what you just put down.         For example you put done: "Oh yeah and if one of my family members is doing a party, or even just a lunch thing for a birthday, she invites him!! I've asked her before and she said he wasn't but me and my sister think he is >:\ ."               What "is" this thing you think he "is". It seems like you wrote this out of pure anger.              My advise is to give this guy a chance, it seems like your mom really want you to get to know the guy.|`|eUUcriANaa	tell her you do not like him and you would prefer not to talk to him|`|pkjOPGRiaa	i GOT THE SAME PROBLEM MY MOMS BF i DON'T LiKE HiM i iTS WENT SO FAR WHERE iVE HiT EM BUT THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER JUST DON'T SAY ANY THING TO EM iF HE ASK SOMETHING ANSWER KEEP iT MOViN SAY Hi AND BYE iTS WHAT i DO iT MAKES HiM SO MAD
NEw5dsJlaa	You're obviously a nice guy, I wish some of the jerks I liked in the past considered my feelings before they turned me down! Anyway, just be honest with her, give her the friendship vibe and tell her that there is someone you're interested in already.|`|ge31hwM6aa	just go straight out and say it " sorry but i like someone else" its not you fault. If your embarrassed just let someone else tell them.|`|WIBzTQ5caa	you learn how to type|`|3QIoa38Naa	Girls love sex.  So have sex with her, then leave.|`|rAeJ74Neaa	well if you know which girl you want to be with then you just need to explain to the other girl/girls that you have feelings for another girl and would happily be friends with her but just try not to get too big headed about it and especially dont lead her/them on we hate that .
AA10982164	You can fight to have child support reduced based on what you are paying out on the child.    Keep all receipts for everything you but for the child, especially daycare, and clothes if you are letting them be taken back when the child goes to Mom.    Have a record of every night the child spends at your house. Also, you might try to have some proof that her boyfriend lives with her, such as something that shows that as his home address.    Also, try to have some proof that she is asking for child support so that she can "get her hair done", either in a letter, a copy of an email, or something. Child support is for the support of a child, food, clothing. living expenses, NOT so Mom can get her hair done!    When deciding child support amount, courts usually consider any money you spend on the child, but you have to have the receipts to prove your stand.|`|eUUcriANaa	if you are paying child support you do not have to pay for the other things unless the judge ordered it.|`|qgL98Wv2aa	i get sick and tired of hearing how women will try to take men to the cleaners over money and use the kids to get it.......get a hold of a lawyer and see if you can make a deal....calculate the dollar amount you pay and find a way to pay portions of the child's TRUE needs like you say you pay half of the day care.....offer to pay a balance of what is left of the monthly support towards the car she needs it to transport child to school, doctor etc....then with what is left towards the rent the child does need a roof over his head......if she chooses to live above her means that is HER  problem not yours you do YOUR part for YOUR CHILD the money is him NOT HER........ does you state have a debit card system like do here in texas?  the child support payee can see every transactions that is being made and bring to court any unusual activity  like going to the club buying alcohol, getting hair done and so on  good luck      LET'S RODEO SAN ANTONIO YEEEE.....HAAAAAA
ZNwV73Y0aa	1.be YOURSELF! dont pretend to be someone your not to get a guy to like you|`|Z03zgM0maa	give breathing space. let him hang out with his friends, and you hang out with yours. don't get mad about little things. that is the main problem people have|`|sAEpRinVaa	never stop giving him blow jobs|`|jmzKBenBaa	do the little things that drive him CRAZY! ok well how old are you and how serious are you? This answer if if you are like a kisser and are serious. Ok so like give him a backwards hug and turn you head to kiss him. Alwys whisper in his ear messages that drive him nuts like: i love you baby, your mine,  *growl......*. Stuff like that. Then lick his ear or kiss it. Licking the tops give more of a "get naked at my house" feeling thought. Also, when you sad let him comfort you. Give him extra hugs and kisses. I dont know how far you guys are, but if your a very phyical couple and a bit older like 18 or 20 invite him to your house and make out with him. Also if you are really physical make out in his lap than stop after a few mins and whisper in his ear: can i do something naughty? If he says no than make out again more passinatle and leat his hands up your shirt and move your lips to his ear and say: pleez baby... you no you want me to show you my bad side then kiss hime very passinatly and say please? Make him wan to say yes. than pull his arms under your bra and put your hands down his underwear... hope this helps!|`|dyJMcfckaa	Sorry to tell you this, but at the end of the day, males are only interested in one thing. Find out his deepest, most secret fantasies - the things he never shares with anyone - and fulfill them. Over and over again. Postpone the climax until he weeps with desire, stretch it out, then postpone it a little longer. Don't stop until he literally can't stand it another second. When you're finished, leave him begging for more. Get him addicted to this kind of pleasure, and he will give up anything for you. Not kidding.|`|FSfDD2Qcaa	realize this:  he isn't your slave.  Let him have his fun with the guys, even with the girls.  If he is really your boyfriend than you don't have anything to worry about.|`|5mNKSsHyaa	be a good listener, have a positive outlook, and communicate|`|Y9k9XTRwaa	dont always be available.  NO NAGGING.  be nice to him but  do not take mistreatment.  dont give IT up easily.    these will make him stay for a long time :)  good luck|`|cgiMEJSbaa	Make him feel like he an important person in your life.  Communication is very important also.  Don't flirt with other dudes.  And I think you will be okay.|`|60NJNjEpaa	1. Listen    2. Give him space and "me" time    3. Stroke his ego    4. Keep being the person he started dating in the beginning|`|uHcGn3Yaaa	Communication  Honesty  Support  Trust  Humor    To me those are the most important things for both sexes to contribute to a relationship.|`|CN7klGgbaa	communication|`|wvdTr3mRaa	Trust.

(:|`|R5mmX9Woaa	I need the same advice. But the thing my bf says he likes about me is that i'm a good listener, so focus on your strengths, and be a good listener.    P.S: If anyone wants to help me please answer my last question.|`|5ciDai7Paa	Don't be too clingy but don't be standoffish, try to find something you each enjoy and spend a date enjoying it, have fun, remember dating is supposed to be enjoyable, don't be the only one willing to change, let the both of you grow together you have to trust him, and love him|`|6MMqlCfuaa	Your good enough.

NOT sexy:  nose.  Nose piercings are just ugly and detract from any beauty.  Nose ring and a cigarette will make as unattractive as can be.|`|7cjqT33Baa	There is no blanket answer for this, some guys like it, some don't.  My husband hates tattoos and piercings (outside of ears being done).  He said it's a gigantic turn off.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	Not. Not at all.|`|AA10743159	I wouldn't mind some small tattoo, but I'm not into piercings per se.  I just find it a big off and disconcerting, and not attractive at all.  Who really knows why we like somethings and not the other, I may just be a bit old fashioned, in that regard.|`|INkafu0uaa	well i have my tongue pierced and my husband loves it ! i don't need to explain why Lol! and i have his name tattoo on my chest he loves that too!|`|THWHHHRWaa	most men that i know, (men, not boys) dont like them. tacky!!|`|df9f7cedfb85f18f6689c6f840f93cbfaa	It depends on the guy and what he likes. i like tasteful ones.  do have some in the special places if you do can I come over and play after we eat dinner?|`|tcyuTHjPaa	What ever makes you happy,will also make someone else.|`|45UTKuamaa	A tasteful tattoo is OK  ears piercing are OK but women have enough decoration with what god gave them!|`|WPVtTM5xaa	Tattoo's: Indifferent as long as its not ridiculous.

My fiance got pretty upset when he saw it, now he's used to it.    I dont think men like piercings very much...=(|`|XGHLrOklaa	Angelina Jolie and she's hot that's all I have to say.|`|A5oKmxERaa	i think it is sexy because you can explore with out getting into trouble.|`|z4ISBfDbaa	They're Disgusting, and they bring assumptions by others upon themselves. Wearing tattoos and piercings gives a very bad first impression to most people you meet, Not good.  Like the song says, "Get It Right the First Time"    There's a reason they call'em tramp stamps.    BTW-tattooed women are usually democrats...|`|DlCcFu1eaa	I don't think so. A little exotic but strikes me as trashy just a bit. Especially the tat. It's like putting on a piece of clothing and saying I'm going to wear this for the rest of my life. Things change, styles change. Women are so beautiful how they are, no need to paint them up.|`|6wzQhsIkaa	i have 9 tats and my nose and ears pierced...Some men love it, some men don't. But it takes a true man to see past that and like the person.|`|QmpobMj7aa	A tramp stamp is acceptable.  Or a single arm tat. Or a small one on the stomach or heel.  Piercings:  The belly's fine. Ears are fine. Vagina, tongue, and nipples are just slutty.  And the nose is just sick.
MjTDXk4kaa	I honestly believe its because most people dont put God first in their marriage and I have found that is the number one thing that keeps my marriage going!!|`|epQXDf9Kaa	society altogether|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	both its a easy comp out   its just something that people dont really work at there relationship and think its greener on the other side|`|cLfIJgudaa	Because people are too lazy to try and work things out. Oh and the majority of people have no morals or ethics and adultery seems to be the common thing now a days. I blame society.|`|hp1dbME4aa	I think divorce is so high because marriage is hard work. I honestly think it's probably an even split. Out of the divorces I know, 90% are because the significant other had an affair. People have commitment issues. The other 10% were physically abused and praise God they got out!|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	Its neither man or woman. Its both! People do not take the time to really get to know someone before they get married and things start to fall apart after sometime. You should always ask/talk about, religion, money, where you want to live, kids, family, work etc...its just not all about love. That would be nice though|`|nFlOQg4Laa	Both because they don't know how to work things out.|`|7cjqT33Baa	Because people are lazy and have unrealistic expectations going in.  Most women watch too much Sex in the City and just want to get married and have the big fantasy wedding.    I just think as a country, we are getting dumbed down and watching too much TV.|`|RdHED7Yhaa	Both because we are not honest with each other.  Sharing a part of your life with someone else doesn't mean you stopped loving you wife.  Variety is the spice of life.  None of us own anyone so lets stop acting like we do. SECRET AGENT PATERNO and MILDRED is my LEADER|`|f9tqe9vsaa	its because of all the divorced people|`|ZqmZQ3yVaa	Cuz people can't commit and because people fall outa love with their partner.

Welcome to life. In the end, they get what they want. That's just the way it is. don't fight it directly.

Try reading the 48 laws of power by Robert Greene.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Take her to somewhere neutral away from the marital home & have a discussion.    Has she always been like this or have you never been able to communicate?   You both need to wake up & smell the roses.   Marriage is like a garden- well tended it will blossom beautifully - ignore it & it will wither & die.  You don't say how long you've been married or what sort of things that she does not listen to?  Take care & be mindful where & when you bring the subject up for discussion or you could end up with a mini-cyclone.|`|y5j97EXuaa	go out and have fun.. don't listen to her either  you guys need marriage councelling  dude, she's probably the controlling type  tell her that behaviour could lead to divorce|`|ljwJr6u8aa	do you want to be happy? or do you want to be right?|`|MjTDXk4kaa	I do not know your situation or how bad it is but I have been reading alot of marriage books and my church is now going through the Fireproof "Love Dare" If you havent seen the movie you should really try and rent it and watch it with your wife its and EXCELLENT movie. As far as her not listening to you I know that women are very emotionally driven and my question to you would be how are you coming across to her in trying to get her to listen to you? Because a woman definetly makes most of her decisions based on her emotions and if she is feeling any way that you are talking her down she may react in not listening. Not sure if this really helps much but honestly if you get a chance rent that movie it will def. help!! God Bless!!|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	Did you not realize this before you got married? You should have talked about this issue then, b/c it's gonna be hard to get what you want now.|`|cLfIJgudaa	ok why does your wife HAVE to listen to you anyway? She is her own person. It should be give and take on both parts.|`|AA10211580	If you want your wife to listen to you, then you should also listen to her when she's talking. Let the other person speak and vent first before your talk and be sure to listen to them (or act like it).

If you answer "no", find out why...often times women (myself included) don't listen to my husband when he is being a jerk. (As in when he doesn't act loving towards me or when he's rudely sarcastic, etc...)    If you answered "yes", maybe there is more going on that you can't see...Do something sweet to surprise her. It will catch her off guard. Wait a few hours and then sweetly bring up the subject. See if she listens then. I don't know any woman who wouldn't be swept off her feet by a sweet love note.|`|XawBWMQraa	well you can figure out the reason why she does not listen and address that problem. then you will get her to listen.    she obviously does not listen for a reason. i suggest what to do, without having any idea what's the reason behind it.    ask her|`|Whd6tqLzaa	You try to listen to her. After I caught my husband of having an affair, he started this new thing that I never listened to him. All I know is he never listened to me, never consulted anything with me, never asked for my opinion on anything and never took my advice. Now he is complaining that I never listened to him. He should have told me that before he started the affair and get out of my life. Men are selfish and they only look for their own needs.|`|db440e48d3204833c920aa88aab4ed5daa	I am sorry but was she this way before you signed marriage papers and if  so you have a real problem and if not then she has a problem .   The only thing you can do is discuss this with her and see what she says and hope you both can work something out.
2JJLYSAKaa	Write a letter from her to him and then a letter from him to her telling them to meet somewhere.  You can be there with cameras and all your friends and spy behind a menu or something and catch them together.  Make sure you take pictures and if you can get close enough to tape record their conversation and send it to your friend to prove that she has been cheating on him the entire time.
ORN59idwaa	Ask the guy out! It has never failed me before. What she is doing is very unhealthy. If the guy says no to you, oh well. He doesn't deserve you. Get a new guy and flirt with him.    Mean version:  Pretend to flirt with a new guy. Pretend to like him. Then go tell your friend about him. Don't bring up the fact that she might flirt with him. Then, continue flirting with him, and pretend that you REALLY like him. It's best to get the guy in on it too, so he wouldn't feel used. Hopefully your best friend will start to flirt with him. This way, you get your old guy to yourself.|`|3QIoa38Naa	I don't have the patience to read this whole thing.    But your friend is most likely a huge c%$

oEYrC1Wsaa	I would not go to these 'meetings', why all of a sudden are they trying to get back into your lives? There is usually an ulterior motive.  Your kids are old enough to say I'm not going they are adults after all, who needs uncomfortable history & baggage dragged up.   Look after yourself & children.|`|AA10652271	It sounds strange that all this time would pass and now they want to get in touch with them.|`|s1LfdCdsaa	Sounds like a possible attempt to hit these adult children up for money. If they are uncomfortable with these people, they need to remain estranged from them.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	sounds strange.|`|CP1VYev4aa	People change over time, and regret some of the decisions they made in the past.  Re-connecting with family is one of the areas that people realize what is important.  Family is the most important thing in life, and if you do not encourage your children to connect with family, then you are doing a great disservice to them. Family is who we are.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	That's a shame. I'm sorry to hear this. Good luck: No one can say anything to make this situation better.|`|OG4410bdaa	sounds like my situation  my mother left when I was about a year old  and she was one of four kids, plus her parents...none of whom ever talked to me again  until I turned 20 and got married  then all of a sudden, out of the blue they start calling    I had no interest in talking to any of them  they went a good 19 years without a letter, a card, a call, a email...nothing  so why would I want to start talking to them now?
uoY06vSfaa	Before you go popping off about how much you like this guy, find out why he doesn't talk to you anymore.  If you find out that it was something very negative that ended your conversations, then you're going to have to leave him alone because telling him that you like him would just be a waste of time.  Chances are he just couldn't get the courage to ask you out and became embarrassed.|`|IRptjY2Maa	Well you should talk to him. Write him a note or something. That happens all the time, the most likely reason for this is because a rumor probably was passed around. Just work it out with him!   Hope this helps! :D|`|i9MlY6J3aa	Are you really young? Because if you are, then he might of found out that you like him and been freaked out. Stupid boys. They are so immature :P|`|nql213V6aa	I just recently told my friend that i liked him, and everything has worked out.  We are actually going to go out this saturday.  So, I say go for it.  But, if you are reluctant, just think, whats the worst that can happen?  They don't like you back? There are plenty other guys out there, and i'm sure you are young.  So Just, take a breath, and go for it.  Take it from me, you won't regret it.|`|l1zvTRVAaa	OMG! same thing happened to me!! just keep talking to him. if he's like anyone i know, he's going thro a phase. don't give up. it will work out i promise :)|`|ddf488e8aadc005298da52c8383e091faa	1st find out why he isn't talking to you anymore, then get your friendship going again, then you can tell him that you like him :)|`|MzWiGnqdaa	Tell him...   what more would you like to hear from the peanut gallery ?
bM4zYt44aa	I'm almost lost for words on that one.  All I can say is when they're standing around each other awkwardly just put yourself in the middle and start a conversation and make sure both of them get involved in it.  You maybe have to slowly get them away from the text messaging and get them talking and as you say touching each other.  That or have a girls sleepover and do the pillow fight in the underwear thing, then have him come over and see her half naked, if that doesn't make him want to touch her...find her a guy that does.  And yes I know girls don't really have sleepovers involving pillow fights in their underwear but let me have my peace of mind believing they do.
lwJiJOseaa	i know what you mean.  i feel like that all the time...  i've told my friends that i felt like that.  and they said it was stupid. and in time i get to believe them, then i dont. im on and off.  most of the time, its just me being stupid.  so try and not think about what they think of you? and theres nothing wrong with you.|`|9LoHPvopaa	the question is: what kind of group are you trying to be on? ask yourself what kind of character and likes you have.
GiD26rYkaa	do the friend plan, ask ur closest friend to ask his closest friend who he likes. If he doesn't say do the same thing again but spreading the word u like him. Hope it helps:)|`|c4Mim18qaa	just forget it. just kidding try to look sexy and he might think u are hot and ask u out|`|JiJwxr1taa	Be yourself.|`|4kcXEwtTaa	Well just be yourself and of he doesnt like you then you guys weren't ment to be|`|G6VIiWsvaa	Jus dont try 2 hard or you'll look 2 desperate!|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	ok, yu cant make some one like yu.  & friends always say "oh he lyks yu." or "yall would be a cute couple"  but they are just bein yur friends.|`|fNctrQ4Haa	Dress really pretty to school see if it works. 0_^|`|QWlnlOFVaa	be your self if it's true he likes you then why change??|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Its shallow and inconciderate to try to make somebody like you.  Not saying that you are shallow and inconsiderate.   Just saying that's the image it puts out|`|KDCXd3B0aa	If he likes you and looks at you, then thats cool. But you can't make someone like you, or change for someone, it doesn't work like that|`|Ug59D75laa	There's no secret to getting people to like you... sorry.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Always be yourself. If he doesn't like you, forget him. He's not the only guy in the world  ?|`|OB2JbmFcaa	You can't make someone like you.|`|rceK0oglaa	what you should do is talk to him and ask him what he likes to do then find a common interest you shear then when you see him in the hall use the common interest to talk it works most the time cause the guy sees ur true personality|`|4rs0KXiTaa	you cant get someone to like you.|`|Sg0gCtEAaa	Dress like a scanky preppy ***** and wear a shitload of makeup
VxwdwwuDaa	Talk about the bad stuff that happened to him and stuff just stuff that would make him sad or get him to see a sad movie or book|`|bM4zYt44aa	Kick him in the twig and berries.  Or have sex with him and then tell him you have AIDS.  Mace him, pepper spray, that'll do the trick.|`|EVmIIyUAaa	insult him real bad but apologize!|`|GOvAR5o3aa	kick him in the nuts as hard as u can. If his a guy he'll cry|`|rNSM38Jaaa	Just pinch him or make him so depressed or miserable.|`|TLEJruPfaa	have sex with him then get married, have love babies, then leave saying it was all a joke    b4 you leave attach jumper cables to his nipples as you turn on your car to leave him
1nk8WPrtaa	I would say, yes. That sounds like the master plan.|`|lrJN4M49aa	It depends on level of maturity and if the person are ready for the commitment age really doesn't matter.|`|dhyYvwYOaa	Late twenties early thirties is good.|`|442e5f4a3db253f9ae4c7782d74143a1aa	I've also heard of people getting married in their 30's and divorcing not a year later.

I think she's insane, and it will not work out.|`|a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	i learned in my abnormal psychology class that people's brains are not fully developed until their mid-20's.  therefore, if two people marry when they are 20, they stand a very good chance of waking up next to someone 10 years later who is literally not the person they married.  sad, but true.      also, i believe that people who are younger and don't really get a chance to experience life are selling themselves short.  they either realized that they married too early and try to get out of it so they can live their lives, or they end up cheating because they realize that they are unhappy.      don't get me wrong, i was first in line to get married when i was 18, and all i can say about it now is thank God that didn't happen, because it definitely wouldn't have worked out.  i have learned that it is possible to be in a committed relationship without being married.  if it's really going to last forever, people can wait a few extra years to get married.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I got married when i was 22 and have been happily married 18 yrs...I think it depends on maturity not the age of the person.    My husband was 26 when we got married.|`|cFrtOg45aa	Yes, Your 20's should be about having fun. Experiencing life.|`|AA10652271	I married in my early 20's and have been married for 14 years. So it depends on if the person is ready to get married it does not matter the age.|`|cLfIJgudaa	yes. guaranteed the divorce rates would be less.|`|AA11967247	not necessarily, people have waited until theyre 40 or 50 and still get divorced.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	depends...do you want to enjoy grand children some day?

X8OcRh41aa	I'm so sorry. I know exactly how you feel. i lost my dad in 04 from a big truck crash and i was 9. My gramma only recently got sick. It;s complicated but we don't see her alot and she sends us letter that don't make much sense because her mind is going. No one has a right way to deal with death. So there isn't really a definite answer. Just be there for your mom and siblings (if u have). you might not realise how much a phone call every dew days(or everyday!) will mean to you grandma in europe. Really! it will mean alot to her. try to stay in contact with her. update her about you. if possible maybe you could visit your grandma? really its little things that matter. if possible u might consider counseling. at first i thought that i didnt need it that i wasnt crazy, but if you find a really good on a counseler will really help. again, i'm very sorry for your loss :*( hope you and your family are doing al right. remember, crying and greiving really is good for you. hope i helped.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Megan I am so sorry for your loss.  It is hard to deal with the passing of a loved one, particularly in such awful circumstances.  Your Dad would of passed very quickly, & not suffered.   He will always watch over you, & is in your heart & will always be alive.  Life is so unfair @ times.    As for your Grandma back in Europe, is there someone that can drop in & check on her?  Surely she has friends or other family like sisters/brothers that can help her through this difficult time.  It is hard for parents to accept the loss of their child, by nature's law they are supposed to pass first, but it is not always the case.    It is okay for you to grieve & it will take a while for all of you to adjust Please take each day as it comes, & go with the flow.  The best thing you can do, is carry on with your plans (when you feel a bit better) & make your Dad proud.  I lost my mom @ a young age & it does knock the stuffing out of the family unit for some time.   Take care & god bless.|`|R8fEO8tUaa	find some family relative in europe and ask if they can keep ur grandma some company  try to keep ur grandma well, and i kno its really hard losing a parent

Z2EzfQFvaa	No..your parents love you..and no matter what they would never wish that they never had you.Now..I'm sure that them not having you would give them more money to spend on themselves and stuff..and more time for them to go places...but I'm sure that your parents would much rather keep you.Your parent love you..and whatever you are thinking about that makes you think they'll be better off without you..just forget about it mkay.Whatever is troubling you..I hope you can have God help you out with it..and I'm free to talk if you want to email me.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	i used to think like that too i'm gonna guess one of your parents are making you feel that way|`|3e8a39c6c9f9b1330670c4d466725f66aa	Absolutely not! parents always loved there kids no matter what...think positive for yourself you can do better than that.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	NO! no parents wants to see their child leave them. they love you and they would miss you.|`|f6c47ede968a991ebcbd24c36070d6a8aa	What makes you feel dumb?

If they say things, focus on what they make those comments about, and try and work on it, IF you feel it needs being worked on.      They will NOT be better off without you.

1k7LIZVWaa	It's time you sit down and be honest with one another.  If your relationship is that stale, staying together for the child is not worth the agony.  Take it from me.  I am very knowledgeable in this area.  I should have left my marriage a minimum of 10 years before I did.  I was married for 24 years.  I paid dearly and in many ways.  It was not best for my children for me to stay, it was worse on everyone.  I am a much happier woman these days with a new life.  I think you will have more respect for one another and yourselves if you can be honest.  Don't be afraid to be alone.  For me, it was liberating.  I loved coming home and knowing where things were (right where I left them) and not having to answer to anyone but myself.  You can find another person when you are ready and want another relationship.  Maybe next time, it will the the right one.  Children do better with happy parents.  Two happy parents need not live under the same roof.|`|z9uCBsmxaa	You need to change your attitude or change your address.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	try to rekindle your relationship. just picture yourself out of that house and in a apartment. then you having relationship problems and her living with another man. your son calling him dad. this could be your future if you don't work things out. if your wife feels like you don't love her she could make you leave. and then tell everyone the things you have done. then it's real hard to find a good person who will want to try to have a relationship with you. think about this. it is easier for an ugly woman to go to the bar and have sex than a good looking man.|`|3wjoT0W6aa	you need to be straight with her.  the relationship is definitely heading downwards.|`|a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	i think...and this is from experience...that if you are not happy in the relationship you need to end it.  it doesn't sound like it's going to be a big surprise, since she feels the same way.  but there is no sense staying together if you aren't happy.  life is too short to miss out on happiness.  if it wasn't meant to be, then it wasn't meant to be.  you tried, didn't do anything wrong, that's just the way it is.  move on.  and your son will probably be happier in the long run when he sees you both happier.|`|nKosOzuVaa	Jeeze, split up and give each other a chance to be happy. What an awful way to feel about your relationship.|`|ReH5EoR0aa	You need to fess up to her anything you have done that you wouldn't want her to know about.  You will find when you do that, she probably will tell you things too.   Be able to have it, and let it go.  We are all human and we all do things.  The good news is, we can fix anything we have gotten ourselves into.      When the air is clear, it is time to create this relationship.   You had it once, to produce a child.  You can have that back by creating it.      Communicate what you both want in life to each other.   And make it happen.   Work towards a common goal.   Your child will see that and participate with you, because it means survival for all of you.    If you do the above things, you will have the best future anyone could have, because you made it happen.   That is creating your life and the lives of your family.   It is something others will envy, because they may not know how to do it either.
a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	You need to have the court DEMAND that he pay child support and carry health insurance for your child.  He has a moral as well as financial obligation, just as you do, to provide for the child's needs.      Quit being "neutral".  Take him to court to secure child support and medical benefits.  It doesn't matter if he's been unemployed since 2007.  The state can and will set a basic statute, despite him not having a job.  In CA, the court can figure than an adult who states they are unemployed is capable of making $8.00 an hour, 40 hours a week, times 4.3 weeks in a month.  They will also require him to provide for medical benefits.|`|AA11967247	i would of done that a long time ago.|`|CVtwbIKLaa	Your child is paying for you trying to be nice.

Well, it's the closest to equal that I've ever been. We both support each other 100 percent, and we're both there for each other no matter the situation.    Though, when it comes down to it, I think I'd be the one to give up more... Not that I don't have faith in him, I just know I'm willing to sacrifice almost everything for him.|`|APDvOr4naa	i don't have a significant other.... :(  yet... lol.|`|el8yX5q3aa	Oh I think sometimes I do more and sometimes he does.  I don't count it out....and I am not interested in keeping score.  When a marriage or relationship works...it works.  Whether you understand someone and their feelings and don't try to control them....you just don't argue.  WHY should you?  Everyone is entitled to their opinion.     not to say we in 41 years we haven't had our share of arguments...but most are silly or due to a lot of stress.    And listen...nothing is 50/50..that is impossible and just something people say.  You either give more or you don't...when there is a disagreement compromise means someone doesn't get what they want...therefore someone gives in.    It is all about how much you want to see and feel what the other is feeling and go from there.  Sometimes you go on faith...sometimes out of stubbornness.    When you both feel that strongly that is when you compromise and someone isn't going to get what they want.|`|SUwNL9pIaa	ANSWER MY QUESTION!|`|bBSAFsrhaa	its always 50-50 that's what a relationship is supposese to be|`|IN1X1CVGaa	my boyfriend, but not in a bad way  we treat each other equal  hes just more sweeter and understanding like hes supposed to be|`|Q0dUjG1Zaa	it depends....|`|w4kEwcpdaa	50/50 sometimes not always like that.|`|XzLUA7ataa	It should not even be 50/50, but actually when you give 100% as much as possible, you'll be getting more from the relationship, too.    In our marriage, it's definitely me.  You can determine it by listening to what others have to say about your relationship, as I have by what friends and acquaintances tell me.|`|1827d79e1a59bbeb213b8e03785ba568aa	he does, and i will tell you the reason why! i am not attracted to a man that can not keep a hard on for more than 2-3 minutes, and further more...i love getting face, but it gets old after a while. i want the real thing sometimes, and it's so damn predictable. it's almost like WOW am i ever gonna see a change in your performance. i try to be nice about it in the most positive way, but it gets old after a while.     Someone help me out (crying)...ok, not really, but seriously, he is a good guy, just has some issues that are turning me off terribly!!!|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	generally the woman if you ask me but then again sometimes its the man it depends on the situation. but itshould be both the same and be one uint but alot of people dont' do this.|`|rXhDtnbOaa	the guy|`|LGCcmJ5Zaa	Its Pretty Equal!|`|KbZIsj7Caa	we've been together for 6 years, and i have to say that it's been pretty equal up to date|`|Gburbcuiaa	Equal but in different ways.|`|ADRc8gJiaa	ha definately me... i drive forever to go and see him, and he really doesnt do anything... i am mad at him right now, because i am willing to drive to see him on valentines day, and he invited 3 of his friends to come visit him instead.....|`|tmXQe5S7aa	I think i give more but iam sure if you ask my husband he would say its him.|`|NkxRTkTJaa	were both suppose to do our best in our relationship otherwise it aint a relationship.  There's not a specific amount as to how much ur suppose to give...  All that matters is that you both work hard in improving ur relationship|`|3VJTtgRvaa	hi|`|IZJSuShbaa	i think the guy cuz they have all the pressure as in:  The first kiss  am i moving too fast?  things like that|`|3wICIryRaa	I think I do, but i know that sometimes i dont realize when he's giving, so its probably closer to being equal.|`|Jx3TG0keaa	him. hes older. knows more. knows what to do. knows what to say. im a im just goin along with it lol|`|a899c2784f7d18371c6b8f614a000c4eaa	hmm...well, in the area of being romantic and sweet, my bf. He's very affectionate (with some good ol' teasing thrown in, lol). Though, I try to make up for it by giving him more physical contact. Lol, it's just hard to keep up with his compliments and all! I keep trying to balance it out, but as long as he's happy I guess it's alright, lol. I'm just spoiled; half the time I think he's just too good for me, lol.    Overall, though, I'd say my bf.|`|31d67111a1796c3229e9eee05c8961d6aa	I give all I've got to give and in return, I get as next to nothing as you can get. =(|`|nQix64Puaa	i don't even try to count that! love is a both way street for sure but if u know the other one truely cares for you, then why bother to figure out who gives more who gives less?  it's love a business, it's LOVE XD''|`|TlghToOsaa	nice question... I think it depends on how faith each party gives. the faithfulness, the fidelity, there's no need to measure who give more or who shared the most. its how both of you handle the relationship. Just enjoy the company, be positive and you might even know that you'd be the best couple in the world.
52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	I have no doubt that the Boys will take good care of 007 and his friend.  Is it the friend that was married to your friend? Don't know why I asked or that it matters.  Think of the fun you and Belle can have while they are gone..   Tell them there will be a party every night that they are gone...|`|EMKuBql8aa	Well, as long as they lay out the rules beforehand and everyone agrees and understands them, I think it will be ok. Make sure he is clear on every little detail.     Where in CA are you moving to? I live in CA and might be able to tell you of fun, local things to do....|`|qtaT9E3paa	NOO!well maybe but they might get a little ouuta hand/
52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	Yes, with me.  She worked in the school system until the Girls graduated. It's the only way we could really know what was going on and with who, or is it whom?  Now we work together.  How lucky can I get??|`|LMIbr1aeaa	My life would of been different if I would of married a hardworking business woman, thats for sure! Some women are more ambitious than others and like to have nice things.  They know exactly what it takes to have nice things and they really work hard at it, while some are just content with the simple things in life.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Yes Mine has 2 Jobs and She Likes to Work and Its Fine by Me|`|dCmSA6r2aa	wish my man worked outside the home instead of just me then he might be still in my life and my sons life|`|neuprBeGaa	Yes, she does.  We could manage without the extra income she brings in, but we are more comfortable with the extra money.  Additionally, she gets very tired of hanging around the house all the time.  She did that for several years when our kids were younger, and is very grateful that we could afford to do so - but now that they are old enough to take care of themselves, both the money and the adult interaction cause her to choose to work.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	mine is a baby sitter in our home. $15.00 a day per kid,and there are 4 kids she watches.3 out of 4 are in school all day. only have them for an hour in a half.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	i work but once i have a baby i don't want to work, but i will if we need too. but i would prefer being a stay at home mom i'm old fashioned.
bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	Move on. Just making yourself miserable.|`|lFzXZQQDaa	well knowing myself, i would pretend like i move on, but i never lie to myself in the inside. i would know i still had feelings for him.    so yeah, do whatever you think is right. move on for now... look for other fish in the sea. but when the time comes to next summer... :) you'll see!|`|jpbychDAaa	Hmmm. Well, to be honest, honey, summer's a long time away. Are you prepared to wait five more months for this guy? It's fine to keep a little hope, but in the meantime, I suggest you focus on guys without girlfriends who you feel a connection with. After all, Valentine's Day is coming up.  Best of luck! |`|SVW83UERaa	move on ..........  you dont have to hang around waiting for someone, you can do much better :):)    trust me there are plenty of fish in the sea LOL  :):) good luck|`|72Rrtfhqaa	move on baby, there are plenty more fish in the sea!|`|shMfBHaRaa	Don't wait for someone because obviously he didn't wait for you. If you keep your heart stuck on one person, then you might miss that person that is right for you. At that time it wasn't meant to be and if it is then you both will be together, but live your life and whatever happens happens    Also check out my fashion website for more, girl advice, celeb gossip, fashion and much more: http://www.dmariefashion.webs.com|`|NeWHLSAXaa	Well if you really like him then don't give up! I've liked guys that have girlfriends before and I know how much it sucks but then again if he has a girlfriend it might me that he has moved on but like I said if you really like him and know that they'll be broke up then wait it out!  good luck!|`|nb8X0u4Haa	He usually doesn't have a girlfriend by the summer?  Watch out then, maybe you'll be the next girlfriend, and then he'll dump you by the next summer.
ba0d5ff814e4de743ed883cab2a57206aa	Believe me, she knows who you are. She must have been serious about not wanting to be friends to ignore you.  She did apologize to you so I guess it was like a step program. Now she has started over and does not want to interfere with your life or be reminded of her old life.   Maybe you should just let her go. Ignore her or pretend that you do not know her. Say hi if she ever makes eye contact but do not get your hopes up about her being friendly to you.   She has grown but not enough to be an adult about it.|`|XkR2nRGGaa	I feel you you know we all wanna be the good guy sometimes and go wit our gut but if this gurl wants to act that wrong towards you here is wat you do you say hi a couple of time but don't get attached to her then jus dont say anything to her if she doesnt respond after a while if she has a kind flicker in her heart she will speak if not enjoy your college years w/o her in it|`|0HI1k9Oaaa	honestly i know its lame but the best thing is to not avoid her eyes, and if she looks your way give her a pleasant teeth-less smile. but if she never looks your way shes setting the standards of not-talking and respect her decision. (but dont like stare her down)    its the best thing for awkward situations
nKosOzuVaa	If she's there than you can start getting her in the mood now, start doing any little thing that she'll notice you doing (stuff she'd do before you go to bed, that way she has no reason to wander around) She'll appreciate that and it'll make her happy.   Take her a glass of wine/tea/something she likes. Give her a nice smooch on the neck. Come back in and give her a flirty note, another smooch.   When she's done you can meet her at the door and give her a nice long (fresh smelling) kiss, offer her her toothbrush and your favorite PJ's. Pinch her butt and tell her you can't wait to see her in bed.     I'd like that anyhow. :)|`|nvc2QTuQaa	shes your wife....shes there for you to **** her  u have need n thats ok, tell her that    ...or slip a pill in her drink|`|fc2633d8f192d5530fac717c9c7ca3e9aa	Me too. its only 8:30 and he is asleep on the couch so guess tonight is not the night either.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Overall is she happy with you?  That makes a big difference.  Are the two of you getting along well?  Would she say you are a kind/loving considerate husband?  Would she say you are considerate and make an effort to please her / make sure she gets over the finish line in bed?      If she says yes to all that then ask her what needs to change in order for the two of you to have a sex life that is in the general vicinity of where you the male want it to be in terms of frequency and quality.      I hope for your sake you did not marry someone who has a "oh I am starving you of sex - uh gosh that sucks for you huh, don't sweat it you will get used to it" attitude.|`|cFrtOg45aa	Sorry, if you need advice then you just don't know what your doing and probably never will.|`|F5R3TJEQaa	how did you do it on your 1st date?  =0|`|AA10652271	Before she gets home light some candles and make her a hot bubble bath. When she gets out of the bath give her a body rub down. That will get her in the mood.|`|AA11967247	let her get in the door, relax for a few minutes.. for godsakes dont start groping her. talk to her, seem interested then tell her you *want her*, not to just get laid. i dunno, you know your wife better than us.|`|an1b4pXxaa	Say to her "I would like to have sex with you, I realize that you are tired after work so I will make it as quick as I can."|`|2afVnStxaa	Give her two aspirin, when she asks what it is for say "it's for your headache" when she says she does not have a headache tell her this "good, get them clothes off then." Or you could try doing something really romantic, like bring her flowers and some delicious chocolates. Then read her some poetry, especially something written by you that tells how you feel about her. This will work wonders. Hope this helps, good luck to you.|`|aVbLngqmaa	Start while she's still working if she's at home. Tease her and try to take her away from her work. It could turn out fun and playful or it could turn out with her annoyed. If she's the romantic type, you could light some candles, play some music, all that crap.    If not, just start giving her a back massage and eventually start fondeling her, you know moving your hands down to her thighs and whatnot...and you know the rest.|`|o2GmpkvRaa	Have her dinner waiting for her with a nice drink to relax her. Run her bath water with candle lights in the bathroom. when she gets in the bathroom offer to bath her, then dry her down. Do all this without making a sexual advances then she should be in the mood to make the first move.|`|XGHLrOklaa	You have to remember it takes much more for a woman to get turned on than a man.  start with giving her a foot rub or back etc.  She needs to be relaxed but if you only intention is to get "laid" then you should just leave her alone and go spank your monkey elsewhere.  She's probably tired.|`|7fAHPUkkaa	tell her you've been thinking of one of her hot friends and it got you all worked up|`|050d625de676773088de1e0e4f88ccfaaa	break out the smell goods ie. candles, flowers, then find your sexy undies, put some juicy fruit on the plate-- @ 10:20 run a bubble bath (if u can both fit) if not take a shower together and when u get out-- dry her off. Next get some whip cream on your nipples and do a strip tease (but not too loud dont want to wake the babies). Hope that works!|`|cLfIJgudaa	GET HER DRUNK|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	best advise lay yourself|`|tjbPvJxTaa	doesnt your wife have a study break, you could **** her then|`|4rs0KXiTaa	you obviously do not care about her needs. you just want sex. if your wife works from 10:30 im sure shes tired. how about you care for her once in awhile?|`|YVPTBt58aa	Start by doing things for her because you love her not because you just want to get laid. After you figure that out then try to think of the things that you did when you were trying to win over her heart. Make sure she feels apprieciated. Maybe run her a hot bath put on some soft music and light some of her favorite candles. Set the tone. Dim the lights. hold her in your arms and tell her how much you love her and appriciate all she does for you.|`|5poK95JFaa	run her bath until she comes home. light a couple candles in the bath room. offer to sponge her back maybe a rose in some water. 10 15 minutes tops. you and her will be in bed. oh, and a little wine maybe or chocolate. nothing elaborate.|`|Sfr6BdMjaa	You can always get the left over donuts from the fridge...|`|etUDjFnXaa	Hmmm, this may not help for tonight but maybe over time it will.  We have two children (2 years and 4 months), and recently our sex lives have never been better.  What worked for me is:  1)  My husband talked to me.  He told me he wanted to have sex with me but was too worried I was tired or didn't want to, so he wanted a code word (but because of 2 and 3 we haven't needed).  This got me feeling needed and desirable...I thought he just preferred to stay up late and watch TV!)  2)  Made self esteem boosting comments e.g. You are so sexy (and they didn't appear to be at times when he just wanted to have sex)  3)  All this coincided with my friends and I talking about our "Love Language".   Apparently, this is based on a book two of my friends and their husbands have read. It is about working out each others love language and doing this to make the other person stand taller.  From our discussion, the men needed physical touch and for us (group of 5), it was either communication or having things done for us.  It may help to talk to you wife about what she needs "to stand taller!. This book also applies to figuring out your kids love language...do they need hugs or praise etc, so it isn't a sexual book but a relationship one. Hope this helps.
sC2aSAXaaa	You should never change who you are. But perhaps their is something more going on and your not realizing it. Sit down and talk to her about whats going on. She could have feelings for you too. But you should really talk to her about it. And sometimes you need to be serious. But don't change!|`|EVmIIyUAaa	be yourself just tell her its who you are you might change and you might not and that she should let it be but trust me it'll get better|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	no dont change who you are|`|gZn622dEaa	Don't change for someone never...like be your self.And besides im very goofy and my friend always tell me to change my ways and they are never gonna see that.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	well your friend might have recently gone through some things that made her grow up and realize that you dont need to be so silly all the time, and shes probably sick of it. dont change yourself because of her, grow up at your own pace. but find a balance and know when you need to take some things seriously.
HmKY6qZDaa	Yes! Forget him now! You already told him so why not just do it? If he already is an 'almost wife' then why are you worrying about him coming back? Move on. Get over him. ANd find some new guys! =D|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Who cares move on its the best thing to do for everyone.|`|ixHwF4apaa	just do it|`|zSdeMhvAaa	if he comes back? screw him. he doesnt seem like a nice guy and u said what u said so dont take him back|`|bNhyEJHsaa	Im sure you can find someone great for yourself.|`|W9B6EJrWaa	If he "comes back" just call that "almost wife" and ask her if it's OK if he's your "almost boyfriend".     That should get the whole mess straightened out once and for all.      And it'll be hilariously funny, too.  That stupid lstunned look on his face....... priceless.........|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Forgetting totally from your life especially with those whom you have been with closely associated with relation is impossible.You may choose not to recall him that's all.But its the most wisest thing not get get involved unless he comes for any help.|`|voJovnboaa	maybe he wont come back afterall, shes' his almost wife.|`|ruS47Twmaa	ignore him?|`|8OSdPa5iaa	i dont think u should let him come back... If he is pullin this stuff on you, you SHOULD forget about him.|`|W5NbfgR4aa	If he comes back, make him work to get you back. Roses of special days, perfect dates, and much more.|`|KTj9g2mGaa	Well chances are he probably wont come back because im guessing hes a rat rodent jerk who likes to play girls and is in it for only one thing so its best that you just find a distraction.
b9791c0d942f7d7caa7f70d6161e349caa	Why should he give anything more when you give all he wants without requiring more.   Ive never been in your shoes but I have been in his many times.

Don't waist your time, time is something you never recover.  Have faith and stand for yourself until the right one come.|`|rVLolY7raa	Why would you want to stop loving him.

Tell him how you feel. Tell him you want more out of your relationship. Or find someone else.|`|shMfBHaRaa	It's something that takes time, you can't force yourself because you will only be lieing to yourself. Maybe that person does want more they are just afraid to tell you, but if all that want is what they want and there not considering your feelings about how you feel then they're not for you. You have to find that person that is going to do all those things for you but wants more. Don't waste your time on branches or seasons when you could find a root.

6k7C9xETaa	in good ol' texas its 17 (arent we lucky!) It mainly just matters on states laws. you can google your states laws on marriage rules and ages, they are ALL different, trust me ive looked!|`|w4kEwcpdaa	18 for a minor 16 parents have to sign for it.|`|g6tku4aVaa	uhh 19!!!!|`|Gburbcuiaa	I'm pretty sure 16...if you are pregnant. Most likely 18 in most states.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	18 without parental consent. 16 with it.(and being pregnant does not make a lick of difference)  If you are between 16 and 18 you NEED your parents to sign off on it. but really...who wants a permission slip to get married?|`|SRK8pJ0Qaa	it actually depends on the state. and also if you have parental consent you should be able to get married about 16. there was a magazine that had an article on it and showed what the legal age to get married was in each state. im not sure but i think it may have been cosmo cause thats the only one i read. look up the ages online. hope this helped your curiosity!|`|VpCtXEMGaa	The youngest possible age is 18. 16 with parental permission.|`|oXfvBdNHaa	With a traditional American family it is legally 18, or 16 with parental consent (not being pregnant, no consent in some state with being pregnant) however many immigrants have their children get married around 13 (not legally, but culturally). I have a friend who in 7th grade was married, and at 14 was pregnant with her first. She stayed in school. The hmong culture is weird, and that's what she is. Usually, an 18 year old (out of high school) is plenty mature enough at know whether or not they should be getting married. I am 19 and am getting married in 10 months to a wonderful man I've been with since I was 14.
t9rTToWYaa	Well, for each note, you can put lyrics to a song.  For example: the line "When you look me in the eye, I catch a glimpse of heaven." from the Jonas Brothers song.  You can tape the next note to the ceiling cause that's the direction of heaven, up.  Or: the Taylor Swift song, Love Story, put the line, "It's a love story" and put it in a romance novel likeTwilight or something.    :)
FvGKbFlaaa	Tell him ur glad that he understands that you JUST WANT TO BE FRIENDS! And don't back down .. you shouldnt let him get you to pity him.

MwVcSXr4aa	two things you can do:  tell her you want to spend more time with her and help her get some of the housework done so she'll have time to spend with you...with two people working the work gets done twice as fast.  Or you can plan a meal that the two of you prepare together.  that might be fun and you'll be productive at the same time :0)
0AOgjUxYaa	i dont know you or your situation. but im a 40 year old with marrage problems. I strongly recomend counseling if you  want to stay together,this can only help . If he is not willing to go go alone and always invite him. He may never go but it will help you tremendously.we have been to three in two years our best luck has been through our church. we are not splitting up because we are   getting help dont stay if you are in danger!!! Respect him and love him but dont become a doormat it wont work. watch out for things that put pressure on him. also make sure you are having fun with or without him laughing is so important.three year olds are tough take up alot of time ect.. ive had two  whatever you do do it because its the right thing for you and the kid this advice is from a man and even i dont get it, dont try to figure him out we men are an insane bunch. focus on you and only you when your good other things and people will follow.he sounds like he has a few issues. if your going to hold/help him up your going to need alot of strenth. thats why i say take care of you and my favorate thing to do PRAY!!!!!|`|y5j97EXuaa	Your answer lies on youtube  Look up "Dave Chapelle what men want" and you will find your answer there. There are 4 things that men want and Dave Chapelle explains them.|`|df9f7cedfb85f18f6689c6f840f93cbfaa	OK that first answer is garbage. He may have had it really rough. The ? is why are the two of you really fighting. He probably does love you. He might be feeling a little trapped rite now. There is nothing you can do other than give him some space. Is he dealing with other issues rite now too? Talk too him as a friend. Ask him how his day was after the kid goes to bed. ( Is he going out at all?) (  he might be seeing someone don't ask him) You'll be able to tell by his daily habits. If he isn't going out at all suggest he take a night out with some of his friends. He may just need some him time. Don't bring up marriage again. It is ok to fight just not all the time. Be his wife without being married on paper. You don't need that to be married. If you have been living together for more than two years you are probably common lawed anyway. I know you want the ring but you don't need it. If he leaves you as long as he is a good father and helps you with some money for the kid let it happen graciously. So your daughter won't suffer.
ljwJr6u8aa	just tell them this. I don't know what my wife may have told,but the truth is, it may not be very big around but it sure is short!|`|5vgnrvcmaa	If your wife was that forward, you can be also.    Ask them to be ladies and stop gawking at you|`|7foornMVaa	What is your wife thinking?!  You never tell your friends how "big" or "good" your husband is.  That's like advertising.  Now her friend are gonna wanna a piece of the "good" stuff and that's why they are looking at you like that.  Your wife is not the brightest crayon in the box.|`|cFrtOg45aa	Just take it out and show them.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Start wearing a push up bra.

R5mmX9Woaa	Yeah I agree with you 13 is a good age, just make sure both partners are emotionally mature enough to handle a relationship.    Hope this Helps!    P.S: If anyone wants to help me please answer my latest question!|`|ixHwF4apaa	any time after 18+|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	No sex, nothing serious, just have a little relationship, with hugs, talking, hanging out, and occasionally kissing (DONT HAVE TO KISS IF YOU DONT WANNA!)|`|NYMY3savaa	Ugh...i hate when parents try to limit their kids on dating. Let the kids be kids and date whenever and whoever they want. Its a good learning experience and 10 year olds wont be running around having sex dont worry..|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Sure, but I doubt you're going to have any really serious relationships.   No sex btw, just a reminder.|`|YZGLhYGMaa	ya i started dating when i was 13 but i will tell you the min they start dating the closer they are to having sex...i didnt even think about sex and then one day it happened and the rest is history....|`|01pY6dW9aa	When ur parents approve.  Better to get to know urself very well first, and then date.|`|207dFmdHaa	I have 6 kids, our rule is no dating until 16, they can go to group things like to the show, mall, etc, with a group of kids, but no dates, and no girlfriends, boyfriends, until 16....I have 6 kids, my oldest son is married, it worked with him, I now have twin 16 year old boys, and they started dating this year...my triplets are only 4 so I have awhile for them to turn 16.....why rush the dating, you have your whole life, my sons have always been the most popular kids in their class, and the not dating did not kill their social life any|`|Q0dUjG1Zaa	yup. i just turned 14 last week, and the guy i like is waiting to ask me out. he told my friend that he wants it to be special. he told me that in front of me. lol    just nothing too serious|`|KDCXd3B0aa	13, yeah maybe. 14 is a healthier age though I would say. My mum always said fourteen. I got my first boyfriend like a couple of weeks before then and she saw that as perfectly normal.|`|Hf73hMI9aa	It really depends on the people. Some people are mature enough to handle relationships at a young age and others are just far too childish.  Middle school is probably when most people start dating but I personally don't think it means anything at that age.|`|wyRJofXJaa	80|`|0Tz5oZCIaa	about 10|`|jyqK8Wrdaa	official dates i say 16|`|tbKoPNbDaa	i say high school in middle school its so gay|`|QvzkLBa0aa	I think high school. 14 or 15.|`|AA12067181	i guess... 13 is kinda young|`|IZJSuShbaa	when ever you can take a heart break and still move on|`|AA10373737	When your old enough to deal with the consequences on your own, so I guess I'd say dating is for adults!|`|vi177FW2aa	Not that early, they'll have sex sooner.  But don't keep them from dating either, otherwise they'll be totally clueless when they start.  15-16ish sounds good to me|`|s1NS1sqvaa	psh any age is alright! dating teaches you a lot. as long as your not like getting serious in like elementary school its totally kool!|`|Z11WL8U8aa	There is no age. It should be when you're mature enough to handle a serious relationship.|`|QRhlvPQbaa	well you can't really "date" in middle school because you can't really go anywhere without your parents. I say wait until high school, about 15 or 16.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    i reckon :    13 is young but around the 14 - 15 yrs maybe.    depends if looking for serious or not so serious relationship.  god bless|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Group or double dating is best for Middle schoolers. High schoolers may be older, but there are a lot of levels of maturity, so parents have to evaluate every child with each and every situation. What one child may be able to handle another child might not. Every date is different in who it is U R going out with, and where U R going. So there really can't be a set age that applies to everyone. My girls were 15 and 16 before I let them go out much, and I always had to know who they were with, what direction they were headed and approx. what time they were due back home. If they were going to be late they had to call and let us know for peace of mind. It wasn't that I wanted to keep them from going out, it was just that I wanted them to be safe. Most parents feel that way. Kids shouldn't think that mom & dad are trying to keep their wings clipped, it's just that we love our kids, and the world is not always so kind.
WNFlpxdHaa	Well, I can't tell you my outcome because I am currently still in school. However, I know exactly how you feel. I wouldn't go as far as love, but I like him, alot. I have had other teacher-crushes but so far he is the one I think I'm going to stick with. He's smart, witty, cute, charming, and he makes me laugh. There is a 15 year ago gap between us, but to me it doesn't matter. Its like every time you see him, your heart skips half a beat. Even the simplest "hello" from him makes your day. Is that how you feel? If so then I can reason with you. There is no law that says you can't have a ROMANTIC relationship with your teacher, however, a close bond tends to devolp itself into a physical relationship. I find myself feeling sad when he talks to other girls more than me or doesn't pay attention to me as much as I'd like him too. Yes, we laugh, talk, and even have a few (kinda) inside jokes, but he leaves me so confused! I remember every moment I've spent with him and I've liked him for two years now. He knows that I like him, too. He's confusing because every once-in-a-while he winks at me. But then usually its all "not-gona-happen" which makes me sad (though I don't show this because I am good at hiding my emotions). In conclusion, I just want to say I know EXACTLY how you feel. Best of luck too you! =]    EDIT:  Wow I read your additional details and I started liking him when I was 16 and he was 30! Now I'm 17 and he's 31! And he's an English teacher, too! Weird, eh? He is so amazing in my opinion. I just really want to know what he REALLY thinks of me, like honestly. And not in the "you're an awesome student" way either. In the I have feelings for you, but I'm still your teacher" kind of way. But sometimes he can be a jerk. Like I give him Xmas cards, V-tines gift, and random food, like share my breakfast but he can't even remember my Bday! Jerk. I hate sharing things, especially food! But still I can overlook this "tinsy" flaw, because he is still an amazing guy.    EDIT 2:    You are cool. I have always liked older men. Hugh Laurie is hot. Along with, Simon Cowell, Gordon Ramsey, and I'd even go as far as Alan Rickman (he's a little TOO old for me, but he is still good-looking for his age). Beware, one of the reasons that people like you and I fall for older men is because they seem more mature, but not all of them are.  Damn the creepy pervet guys who ruined student-teacher relationships! Wow I've never answered a question this long before.|`|WJ1agL9Eaa	ummm ignore him and get a boyfriend your age|`|a7iuLw4Kaa	If they're old enough to be your teacher, they're too old. Be careful. ^.^|`|A7nIADxgaa	dear god no    it makes me think of one of my pervert teachers >.    it's illegal anyways and the teacher can lose their job|`|Di5dnVcAaa	sounds like gossip girl!|`|00A3BfSEaa	Never heard of that it depends on the age though if it was actually going to work out with both of you.|`|BWgV2xSZaa	But that's illegal...|`|wJcpjDLUaa	i've had a crush on a teacher, i've flirted with a teacher and he's flirted back.  (it was actually really fun).  it's pretty much illegal and they'd lose their job.  things can't really go anywhere.  it could get nasty.|`|511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	Nope, I never had a hot teacher.     If he/she is not married, and you are almost out of school I'd wait until you graduated and go for it.|`|pbPe614Raa	watch  the movie the crush,u will see what happens|`|96nByQtMaa	i liked a teacher too,bt i didnt think anything of it,im curious to know if ppl did too.|`|57DG5xC1aa	I used to have a crush on mine in high school. I gave him a goodbye container of candy and he gave me a hug but that was about it. Now that I think about it, he could've lost his job over that now-a-days!    I can seriously say that they would not risk their career for a high school girl. If he got caught, he would lose his job and never get a job anywhere again. He'd be stupid to do it.|`|wWzO9xARaa	There was a girl from my school who graduated last year or the year before that, and she had a realationship with one of the teachers, he was fired from the district, and I'm not sure if he went to jail or not, but I know he did appear in court.|`|msKHbeCzaa	I mean it's totally natural to have a crush on a cute teacher, I did when i was in high school. But I mean I didn't act on it, and he was a very professional young guy who would never do something like that. So I mean of course it's normal to have a crush on a teacher and even feel like you're in love. But anything beyond just having a crush would be really wrong as I'm sure you already know, I hope.|`|72Rrtfhqaa	thats gross|`|Xi94q0HKaa	no how gross|`|OLpWRv2uaa	I bend over for all my teachers|`|uVH046Fjaa	this offends me!!!!!!    it doesnt matter. just find a guy your age, or stay after school for some special 'xtra help' if you catch me.|`|TepR1rACaa	I did. I loved him since I was 13.  Nothing ever happened until well after I graduated.  I am 22 now, we are married. The end :)|`|SiPGcBnYaa	no no and no. grace manning did that on once and again and we all know how THAT turned out...|`|rVLolY7raa	Only in my dreams.|`|oAeiAW5Jaa	whats the age difference it depends? my bff (older) had the same thing but when she graduated H.S. they dated and got married, so it could have a happy ending.|`|gjoFXwNcaa	No, but I think our new Algebra teacher is hot. Me and my friends scream his name during assemblies. And trust me there is no such thing as a the words good outcome in the same sentence as student-teacher  relationship. It always ends up the same way, with the teacher in jail. Plus any teacher who would mess with a student is not the type of guy that you would want.|`|YZGLhYGMaa	ok well i kinda has this but i wasnt into it at all...my bio teacher was completely in love with me and i didnt even see it...other ppl that i was friend with pointed it out to me and then i said something to him about it a few years after i got out of highschool and he admited to me that he was in love with me for many reasons and that iwas the true happiness to his life and when i wanted to be treated right i would eventually come to him well i was like WOW he is 20 years older then me so i just was lik ok well i am with someone and he was like yes i know and i respect that..well he didnt..he kept messaging me smart *** remarks like o well your so called man or whatever so i just straight up told him that i thought we were friends and that a friend would be happy for another friend if they were happy and what not well he got so hurt by it that he deleted me off of his myspace and doesnt ever talk to me anymore...so i dont really knoww what to tell you but dont act upon it until you are of legal age or he will get in trouble and you wont see him again ya know..|`|UI79JnJVaa	"I wouldn't dream of it."    "It was 'cool talk' amongst   'the fellas', when I was in   my junior high school and   high school years."    "But, all too controversial   and taboo to act out."    "Besides, just how Long before   the secret gets out, anyway?"|`|hwXxXn3baa	Well if you watch lifetime you'll see most often than not the teacher ends up getting arrested. If you are serious and you think that he is serious I say maybe talk to someone else first about it like a friend just to get another persons perspective. What you do behind closed doors is your business. If you do end up talkin to this guy in a serious way, dont tell anyone!! If your friends ask tell them u like someone else now or something like that. Good luck!|`|rwbUF975aa	I suggest you don't develop further feelings for this person. If you do, big trouble will be ahead of you. I'm sure there's so many good looking and intelligent people out there who's in your age group. I understand, such a thought can really spin your thoughts and feel like you're in heaven, but please don't tell the teacher. It will make matters worse. It's ok to love the teacher for who they are but not fall IN love with him/her.|`|8wXuf8gAaa	I had a crush on my 4th grade teacher and I even passed around a note to my friend saying that I thought he was hot. That ****** somehow got the note to my teacher and he had a talk with me. But it was really weird cuz he was really sweet about it. He was smirking and just telling me not to pass notes around in class anymore. lol|`|74ZkgjQkaa	no i havn't and i mean most of my teachers are old sooo yea..but my ex-best friend's older sister has and she married him after she graduated and after 3 years of marriage they have a nice home and a new baby girl :)    i say if you really like him wait till your eighteen to make a move..and start a relationship    be careful though, cause it's really risky...good luck !     :)|`|UCO7blmKaa	i think this is normal.. i dont know if he will take it lightly! maybe you should kindda flirt a little?|`|uB9tFUHcaa	watch Loving Annabelle|`|liYcz3LRaa	it depends on how old YOU are.|`|p0YBJwjUaa	i dated my teacher the summer after i graduated....it didn't last long; i was 18 he was 32.

Week Days   Night - After I eat dinner.  Day - When I get home from School.   From 3:00 - 7:00 P.M    Weekends  Night - After I eat something.  Day - After I make some cup of coffee.  From 10:00 - 7:00 P.M.    So, we are closer.
c5nPUBPraa	I know how you feel; I'm also in a similar situation at my own school. I think it's good to take the high road and not respond to those silly comments, instead of going ballistic. So it's great that you can handle yourself. Sooner or later they'll stop bugging you. Although if they keep on doing it, you can always make a comment back, not a rude one per say, but maybe to that girl you could've been like hah, I guess we both have great taste then", or "Psh if you say so" or "Yeah, I love womans clothes, couldn't you tell?"(Sarcastically of course). Just don't let it get to you, because in the end, you know who the better person is.  Good Luck!    Cass B

f8CN2qIvaa	The fact that you're determined to stay with him no matter what speaks volumes.  If they don't accept him, it is really their loss.  They'll alienate you, and miss out on knowing the wonderful person that I'm sure your boyfriend is.  You'll have to just bite the bullet and tell them.  And keep a positive outlook on the matter.  Once they realize that you won't be swayed, they will hopefully start to come around.  They have no business standing in the way of your happiness for their own petty and outmoded reasons.  Good luck.|`|AA12316366	are you doing this to irritate or get to your parents? that is what it sounds like to me. are you sure you aren't using this poor guy for your own reasons.|`|n53HeORBaa	if they have been like that for a long time and that belief is in their system then there is no way you can change their mind, how old are you anyway, if you are an adult and in the legal age and if you feel that this is that person that you are willing to spend the rest of your life with then follow your heart, even if this is against your parents wishes, trust me you would not be disrespectful this way, you are your own person this is your life not theirs   but if you are still a minor talk this out with your boyfriend ask him is he is willing to wait for you at the right time then you will see what would happen from that moment, you need not to do anything harsh since your parents still have a hold on you if you are still a minor, you just have to keep quiet for now they might do something stupid to your boyfriend if they found out so good luck!!|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Going for the shock value are we?|`|RIZpDdNgaa	You know what, who cares what your family thinks, if you are in love then who cares!

I'm not saying what you should do or not do, but consider this: You aren't the first one to think she was madly in love with someone only to split up in no time at all. It's quite possible that a lot of crap will transpire between you and your family. Meanwhile, he may be gone shortly and they will always be your family. Just keep it in mind whatever you do.|`|5YN5Dge9aa	If you truly love him it doesn't matter. Love has no boundaries.

Since he is too in lust to see that you will just have to accept things how they are until he realizes what a dumb ***** she is and dumps her he will probably talk to you then if you even still want to after the way he treated you|`|Ug59D75laa	He's not worth rebuilding a friendship with.

Honestly, I'm not a vegetarian, and I don't plan to become a vegetarian anytime soon. I eat meat, but I also eat healthy. I don't think eating meat or not eating meat is any better or worse for you either way. You can eat meat and still maintain a healthy diet, but some vegetarians eat unhealthy too. It's a known problem to be able to get the required amount of protein in your diet, and vegetarians can pig out on Cheetos and macaroni and cheese rather than being healthy. Vegetarianism is more about personal choice and beliefs, but you can be an unhealthy vegetarian just as easily as people can be an unhealthy non vegetarian.|`|AA11319441	I think that is the best thing you can do for your body!  Start something you know nothing about, do no research on the subject and then wait over two weeks to even ASK about it.  Ha ha.  Good job!|`|7cjqT33Baa	weird category for this to be in.  I can only answer for myself, but for me it was for my health and also because I don't feel something has to die for me to live.  There are other food options for me.  If it was a matter of surviving, I could understand that, but it isn't.  After I went vegetarian, I lost weight, my complexion became really clear and healthy looking and I just felt better.  It's a whole way of life for me.  I've always felt so drawn to animals, even as a kid.  I just don't want any to die.  If you watch videos on how cruel factory farming is, it's hard to see that and be okay with it.  It's just utter cruelty.  I don't want to be a part of that.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	I wish more people were!!!! I really want to see the whopper go back down to .99 cents again. don't you miss the blt's and bacon cheese burgers?|`|6fLxNyVpaa	i think its crap you can cut down on read meats but you need nutrient and meat is where you can get it besides taking all vitamins.|`|df9f7cedfb85f18f6689c6f840f93cbfaa	Go to the library look up some books get the info online too. Being Vegan is a lifestyle and not just what you eat and don't eat. You have to make sure you have the right foods in your diet to give you the proper nutrients. It is tough to get away from meat. We are naturally carnivores.   Being Vegan can purge your system of bad stuff. but if you don't balance it properly it can be bad for you.|`|RdHED7Yhaa	I don't eat meat, shell fish or chicken and have for 35 years.  I'm not a vegan because I eat fish, eggs and drink milk.  I am 54 but look 40 and I'm not on any medication.  SECRET AGENT PATERNO and MILDRED is my LEADER|`|pXS9xa1Laa	I am a chef and have taken many courses on nutrition and food, so what i am about to say if indeed fact. Many people eat far to much protein in a day. So changing to becoming a vegetarian can cut out a lot of protein. Also, you get much more vitamins and  minerals by being a strict vegetarian. Eating eggs isn't really vegetarianism, it's actually called ovo- vegetarian. you can eat eggs if you want, but another way to cut out animas products would be to substitute beans, nuts and seeds to get the protein you need. If you are going to eat eggs though, you really should only eat the whites because there is an immense amount of cholesterol in the yolks of eggs. Make sure also that if you are going to try and be a vegetarian that you keep your vegetable options broad. Many vegetarian become very ill due to lack of variety. You need to eat "all the colors" for lack of a better way to say it. Green leafy vegetables, orange/red, and dark vegetables are packed with essentail vitamins and minerals. Also the lack of meat in your diet will lower fat intake tremendously. Any more questions and feel free to contact me. Hope this Helps!!!|`|GLz2sX28aa	When my mother had a serious stroke, I had my cholesterol checked.  I was more that twice the number a normal person should have according to my doctor.    I got on a no meat diet for about 3 weeks.  I stopped eating products with hydrogenated oils too.  I didn't use any drugs nor did I exercise.  My cholesterol levels dropped to a low and safe number in that time!    Animal fats are the main source of bad cholesterol and heart and artery disease.  Not to mention the parasites in pork, the hormones in chicken, the mercury in tuna, mad cow disease in beef, and so on and so on.    Other than meat substitutes made from soy, soy and other beans like lentils are such a high source of protein and better for your body.    I eat very little meat now.  And my cholesterol levels are still normal after 7 years of cutting most animal flesh from my diet.
j2cttqpuaa	i'm sorry about what happened.  my best advice to you is the same advice one of my closest friends told me when i was in the most pain i've ever been in, over a guy that i loved: Time will heal.  and at the time, i said okay but never once believed it.  but in time, it really did ease up.  at first, i couldnt even say words that reminded me of him, our inside jokes, or even just things that reminded me of our memories together.  but in time, everything started to ease up a bit.  and after a while, even when i met people with his name, i'd just smile and be fine.  Sometimes, i still think of him and just deep down i cringe at the pains caused by him.  but overall, im fine.  time will heal.  but in the mean time, keep yourself busy.  it helps.  and surround yourself with good friends.  not people just to replace him but good quality friends that are willing to stick with you for a lifetime.    good luck from the deepest of my heart.|`|UCd6blZgaa	if you're really in love, there's no way you're going to get over him.     that's what love is.|`|72Rrtfhqaa	youre young, get over it.|`|HnWKJLZoaa	you can try to stop being stupid|`|050d625de676773088de1e0e4f88ccfaaa	just a crush u cant even call him a boyfriend---NEXT|`|shMfBHaRaa	You just had a little bad boy crush, it happens to the best of us.

Or maybe she's trying to guilt you into hanging out with her when there are other things you have to do?  Like by reminding her of how much she's helped you, and how ungrateful you are.  You let her know that you appreciate her, but go do what needs to be done.  If she's your friend she'll still be there.  If she's really an idiot she won't.|`|ddf488e8aadc005298da52c8383e091faa	Get a new friend. You don't need a friend that does that stuff to you.

mFZeEm9paa	Sometimes, especially if she is expecting her period, the blood is just from that. My boyfriend and I will actually have rough sex purposely right around my period, just so the darn thing will break through already!! Hard rough sex can make a woman bleed and there is nothing wrong with that. It has happened to us all, well those of us who have had great sex anyways!! Don't sweat it, it is normal. Now, hopefully you can recover!|`|bmT12Kx5aa	congradulations!|`|mUD9ndGfaa	You probably tore something or stretched something to far. Really, don't worry about it.|`|pA8YrU6faa	Even if she's had sex before, she might have not popped her cherry yet. It can stretch a lot before it tears. Just be careful next time, and remember: USE PROTECTION!|`|PcozPpA4aa	She wasnt in pain right?    Maybe she was spotting? When you "pop" a "cherry" the blood comes from the skin being torn from the outter edges of the hole of the vagina (the hymen). NOT from the inside, especially deep inside. something else, and if you say she was embarrassed it must have been something she doesnt want you to know. Btw, I agree with the girl who said rough sex can cause a period to start, it does that for me.    I hope shes clean, better get yourself checked out, and consider talking to her.     You guys are way too young for this btw.|`|uHcGn3Yaaa	She may not have been a virgin, but that doesn't mean her hymen wasn't broken.  Some girls have very thick and deeply places hymens.  The other guys she has slept with may not have gone in as deep as you have.  Is she having pain?  More bleeding?|`|kqa9VFrfaa	She was still a virgin. But just in case there is something else brewing she had better be alert to any pain in that part of her body. She needs to get a regular exam by a good doctor as a baseline checkup. The she can ask about birth control. It is cruel for a boy to expect all the irresponsibility of birth control to be left for the girl to deal with. U should be wearing rubbers even if she is also using birth control. I'd say U two have a lot to learn yet. If U do not want to become parents -- get smart and protect yourselves.|`|72Rrtfhqaa	it was probably her period.|`|f98brCdxaa	you could have popped her cherry even if she isnt a virgin you could have been the only one to go deep enough.

As far as some of those, the job thing is easy, get out and find a job, that will bring you money, and you will meet people at work and make friends, then you will go on to meet their friends and have a social life.  From that social life will eventually come a boyfriend.  It's pretty simple really, but maybe there is something I don't know about you so maybe it's not that easy.  But I've found that anytime I have a problem, the first thing I do is take a look at it as if I weren't me and make sure that I'm not the one in fact causing the problem, and if I am, what can I do to fix it.|`|c67H67ppaa	get a job, the money will come, and be a fun, kind person. You can always takl to me if you need a friend :)|`|NqMmvvgVaa	I would start working on those things. Just getting a job would be a start, it is a great way to make friends, hello social life!
xNkmK0SHaa	Since you posted this in "Marriage and Divorce", I assume marriage would be part of your  plan BEFORE leaving USA.    That would require special permits etc. from both governments, probably, and a legal age of adulthood.    I can't believe a girl who thinks she is ready for marriage,  would consider relocating to another country when:  1.She hs known the guy for less than a year  2. She has no experience with the other culture  3. Has not been living other than with her family of origin    Truthfully, you don't come across as old enough or mature enough  to marry, much less leave the only culture and people you have ever known.    What do your parents think about your idea?    I suspect they don't know anything about it.    I advise you to stay where you are.  If the man really loves you (you didn't mention that part), he will return to this country when you are grown.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	I say have a friend come by and hit on him when you are gone. that way you can find out if he really loves you and wont cheat or he is using you for a visa.|`|3wjoT0W6aa	he has 3 years.  what's the rush?  if you think you need more time, then take it.|`|s1LfdCdsaa	No. Despite having the worst President possible, America is still the greatest nation in the world and the best place to be. I would never advise any American woman to move to a foreign country. You will be on someone else's turf and away from your own.    Contact an immigration attorney to understand how marriage may render him eligible to remain here.|`|AA10211580	Why do you need to move to Ecuador? Do you know how to speak spanish? Tell him how you gonna get a job over there if you can't speak spanish (or whatever language they speak over there)? And tell him why can't he just live here with you and he can visit Ecuador when he wants?    You need to discuss this issue with him before he proposes. If he still wants to move to Ecuador after both of you are married and he doesn't consider what you're saying then you will have to decide whether you want to stay with him or not.

My friends call me that too because i wear some black here and there and i have bangs, a lot of people have bangs and a lot of people wear black. it get so annoying.|`|vmzvv2bZaa	What.  The.  Hell.    First of all, dressing in black and covering your eyes with hair does not make you emo.  Sure, you may LOOK like emo kids, but it's more than just a style of fashion - emo has more to do with personality and feelings than anything.    Second, if you skate and shop at skateshops, you're a skater.  Period.  End of story.    Third, why do you have to pick?  You can dress in black and still go boarding with your friends.  Skater culture can certainly overlap with emo culture.|`|c67H67ppaa	Yea, u can be both. Tho i would recomend neither|`|pqSGMukvaa	no...emos arent related to skaters...in my opinion  if u go around depressed and stuff, and wear just black...i would consider u maybe emo...
AcmfbJVpaa	so if you had the problem before why are you still talking to her and telling her anything  sorry but is your fault|`|CYpp9rVxaa	I've gone through the same thing.  You could forgive her, if you're ready too, but make sure you talk to her and make sure she knows that she hurt you.  If she did this before, then she's probably going to do it again, so DON"T tell her anymore secrets.  If she was really your BFF she wouldn't have told your secret, so make sure to be more selective on who you tell secrets too and who are really your friends.  Hope that helps and Good Luck.|`|4vvELzRzaa	forget her, that's not a good friend. u can always make new ones :)|`|hko5rrVoaa	You can forgive her but don't tell her your secrets anymore. if she did this twice already then she honestly does not know how to keep her mouth shut.|`|blhIjLr8aa	Alright i know exactly how you're feeling.  This one girl i knew promised she wouldn't tell that I said someone was self absorbed. She told her and then she got mad..  Anyways this wasn't the first time she did this. And that's why i'm not her friend anymore. As far as what you're going to do..  1. Just think to yourself, Is she worth this friendship?   2. If she apologizes and you want to.  3. As far as other options.. If U still want to be her friend then then start out with telling her little things and see how she takes them and if she tells anyone.
Axtitdo8aa	You need to talk to him about perhaps getting into anger management - this behavior is not normal and has the potential to be very harmful to you both (as well as future children) one day.     This is very important! Help him before everything falls apart - this shouldn't be ignored. Be sure to assure him that you love him - you just want him to get help.|`|Mn1HTfqaaa	You've said a lot in your questions, but what stands out is that the age difference bothers you and that you don't really seem to know why you are with him. Unless he agrees to counseling or some other anger management therapy, he probably isn't going to change, and his job is just putting more stress on him--so now is the time to decide if you are happy with him. You say you love him, but you say "he is amazing i guess..."     If you accept him for who he is, and the relationship for what it is, try premarital counseling and joining support groups for families of first responders, which can help lessen the stress and answer some questions as to why he acts the way he does sometimes. He needs to learn ways to destress and possibly be put on some medication to help him relax and not get so wound up.     Good luck and best wishes to you!|`|b996bdcf34d088f7d764a720874eabe3aa	It sounds like your family and some of your friends are concerned for a reason. Love is blind and they might be seeing something that you are not. I would recommend pre-marital counseling, or anger management, it would be a really good thing for the both of you to do together. Being raised on the East coast, and living in New York, tempers are kind of the norm, as well as sarcasm, but if the anger is being acted out physically, that is not good. If he really loves you and wants what is best for your relationship he should want to do it!|`|UgLCcEpLaa	well who do trust the most as being most sensitive in making a judgement? What about yourself? If you ask yourself the question be careful becasue sometimes you can be mislead by people in life. Keep an objective mind but listen to your heart. good luck|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	I agree with Kim H.  But if he doesn't agree to Anger Management then maybe you need to rethink the marriage thing.  The longer he stays on the job the worse the anger will get.  Good luck girl!
zzUgYFy4aa	ummm, ask him    you have to be honest about your feelings    there is no way that YA can know how HE feels about YOU    just be casual and playful when talking about it
GLz2sX28aa	Being in love is such a wonderful thing.  But I think you need to test your fiance if he really loves you and wants you to be happy.  See, the reason he is short tempered and hot headed is because he was abused.  He may seem come out of that well and good.  But his anger tells me otherwise.  I know this because I married the same type of man.    I ended up divorcing him because his temper just got worse over the years and he refused to get help.  His temper didn't just ruin our marriage, but also his friendships, family and professional relationships.    My advise, get him to counseling for that temper.....BEFORE you say "I do".   I think you should both get pre-marital counseling as well.  I want you to go into this marriage with both eyes open.    Good luck and God Bless you both.|`|R4e7DntVaa	He is probably mad at you because in real life you probably ask the same question over and over and over again and is tired of answering it.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	he has a fart caught cross ways in his blow hole!!|`|AA10211580	You need to focus on your relationship with him and stop trying to get everyone's approval. If you're happy with him and can work out your differences "together" then to hell what everyone thinks of him. That's your life.    edit: if he has anger issues, you can suggest going to counseling "together", instead of just telling him to go to counseling on his own. if he is unwilling to go to counseling, then you're going have to learn to deal with his anger, if you decide to stay in this relationship.  know that you should never pressure your fiance or anyone to go to counseling, it's just going to do the opposite effect on what you want.|`|3wjoT0W6aa	talk to him about going to counseling together.  he may need to speak with someone about anger issues.  if he doesn't work it out, then it may escalate to something more.  you don't want to be on the receiving end of this.  you may want to listen to your family on this one.|`|s1LfdCdsaa	Young lady, you can wake up now, the easy way, or wake up later, the hard way.    Yes, the tension should bother you, since that's the little voice inside of you telling you to get away from this guy. Your brothers don't hate him because they're FDNY and he's NYPD. They hate him because they know too many bravest and finest who are abusive.    Sarcasm doesn't make for a good spouse.  Short tempered doesn't make for a good spouse.  Hot headed doesn't make for a good spouse.  Children of abusive fathers often become abusers themselves.  Abusers don't make for good spouses.    I think it's you who needs to accept that the above qualities all spell disaster if you marry this man.|`|db440e48d3204833c920aa88aab4ed5daa	You can't force someone to like the other to be honest don't worry so much about it because if you love him and that's all that matters your family will soon adjust to it maybe they just worry he will be mean to you ,So really nothing you can do but to allow time to correct this.I wish you happiness always
vYoyGziFaa	You don't have to love your job, as long as it pays well. It helps, but, to take a gross example, people who pump septic tanks are well-paid but don't look forward to every morning.    A good job and a spouse who loves you are the basics, to my mind. If you know someone who works with children - scout leader, soccer coach, etc. etc. - you could ask if you could lend a hand, just to get used to kids.
324rRPxuaa	my friend use to patronize me til i snapped on her one day this is ur friends theory as well as mine both r self centered and its there way or the high way she is the stubborn one dont stop doin u for one of your ridiculous self-centered  friends..this is how i c it u r the rag doll that she is dragging along because you never say anythng i felt the same way and i tld her the damn world does not evolve around you!|`|3Rqq6WjDaa	omg that is excactly what my friend is doing to me!!!! >.  sorry i really dont know what to tell ya coz im tryin to figure that out myself =/  xoxo  hope i gave some support i not helped!   good luck!|`|RzIiywZ6aa	So your basically telling us about this person who your friends with, but is she your best friend, or a huge part of your life?  also, theres 2 reasons I can think of why should would be like this.  Either thats just her personality and she doesnt really notice what she's doing.  Or she really is just that B***** and vindictive and she likes to make other people suffer.   I think you should stop hanging out with her or sit her down and tell her whats going on until she finally decides to listen.  but thats just my opinion|`|6WjC3sJVaa	rant all you want (:   i'll add the answer later im just a tad busy but i DO have good advice im going to add it in a few hours if thats ok...
HT3LtMtaaa	i seriously dont know
mZlPj8Guaa	I have been on this earth for 51 years. I have not even thought about my thigh touching, or what a reaction I might be given. do you thing this is a fetish? Some people get turned on by feet rubbing. Or other actions.    I guess my answer is that I could just say certain people get turned on by many things. Yours is one of them.|`|2ydF6OTAaa	LOL it's common I guess?  I guess it's just a habbit.|`|FmEsMOKVaa	well...I don't know what to tell you about other guys but I don't think I do that. But it is possible some guys do.|`|0Tz5oZCIaa	OOOOKKKKKKKKKKKAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY|`|AcmfbJVpaa	they guy is a horny beast|`|w5AtjQqaaa	Yeah I dunno why, when I'm sitting down, I sort of automatically rest my hand on my balls/dick. Not for pleasure, just an instinct.
FOdBeBUTaa	yeah, every woman does|`|hwIMJBVpaa	no...never. it hurt like someone had a match to my crotch..but no blood. nothing is wrong with you, not everyone does. and some people even say that it doesnt hurt, which i find very hard to believe, but..i guess people are different.|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	Yes she bleed but it was minor. Some girls will bleed more than others. About the easiest way to prevent bleeding from sex is to break the hymen before you have sex. By using your fingers or a phallic object you can slowly stretch the hymen or break it and make it so that when you are actually ready for sex you reduce any pain (if any at all) or bleeding.    Some girls don't bleed anyway because their hymen was already broken. Girls who do rough activities like ride horses or injure their pelvis or take any kind of trauma to that area of the body can break their hymen.    So in your case, no bleeding is perfectly normal because your hymen was already broken and healed prior to having sex.     If you don't know the hymen is a layer of skin that protects the vulva of the vagina. When a girl has sex for the first time, if she has not already broken it, she will bleed from the taring of the hymen. But again, not bleeding is also normal.|`|tbwp9Ko8aa	I didn't bleed (:  Hurt like hell though.|`|QmRYgGnDaa	Its a part of life, yes.|`|m4q3hikbaa	Yes the first time you have sex you bleed a little bit. If you blead alot then I recomend seeing a doctor. Maybe you just blead a tiny bit, and didnt notice it, either that or his pepe is to small to pop your cherry.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	NO nothing is wrong with you. The reason some girls bleed when they first have sex is that their hymen breaks/tears and this is the cause of a small amount of blood being lost. A hymen can break in a lot of different ways ie by using tampons, horse riding, gymnastics an internal examination by a doctor and many many other reason's and it is possible that it broke without you knowing so please do not worry about it most women do not bleed hope this reassures you|`|LGCcmJ5Zaa	Yes . . My Hyman Broke!|`|T07F0BeFaa	I'm afraid i cannot answer that.     +& wht an absurd question. :P|`|pm0O9Twhaa	I never did bleed but my friend did but just a little came out|`|o2Iez6n0aa	i didnt, no problemmm
9RqmSgFKaa	I would google the Chicago board of tourism for the most up to date and accurate information instead of relying on potentially unverified information on Yahoo answers. I always enjoyed Navy Pier, Wrigley Field, the sky scrapers (like the Sears Tower), the North Shore, Lincoln Park - but only in the summer. Otherwise I just enjoy the restaurants, bars and my hotel when I am there in the winter. It is one cold MOFO in the winter.|`|N0hlErEyaa	dont go to a museum go to a cubs game or something!!!!!!!|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	You'll have to look up these places on the internet...|`|om2lE7jfaa	Chicago is polluted dont go|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	You have to check each of the places websites.  They all vary.|`|RzIiywZ6aa	Just look it up on their websites  and if you're going i would recommend visiting the bean,  and if your going soon, ice skating in millenium park.  and every city is polluted, but chicago happens to be one of the cleanest.|`|ON84EQaBaa	Not sure about free days, but Chicago is a great place to visit, beauitful with so much to do! when you get here enjoy!
RdHED7Yhaa	Yes he is cheating. My theory is if he is not loving you he is loving someone else.  Now you need to have a little and see just how much is in the thing and ask why is his tank so low.  SECRET AGENT PATERNO and MILDRED is my LEADER|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Have you changed?  Are you still about the same level of fitness / about the same weight as when the two of you met? How about him?  Is he at about the same weight / fitness level?|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Try doing something out of the norm.  i.e,. put a feather boa on whilst naked & dance around the bedroom.  Do the vacuuming nude.  Run a bath & place candles around - invite him in then after the bath give each other a massage.   Buy some edible undies, chocolate body sauce, etc.  There are plenty of things you can do.    Just make an effort, he obviously has got used to you being around (can't see the wood for the trees) & is getting his 'jollies' by watching porn.   IDK about going solo when your in bed together - what's that all about?  Hope that helps.|`|y5j97EXuaa	David Chapelle has your answer on youtube and here's the link    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZRflz-93...|`|ljwJr6u8aa	buy yourself a corset and some fishnets . and if still ignores you he must have a problem getting it up!|`|AA10652271	When things start to get boring with my husband I role play. He loves it when I pretend to be his girlfriend and do things that I normal would not do.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Men do this, Simplegirl. Sometimes it has nothing to do with the spouse; sometimes it does. Could he be cheating. No simplegirl, you know most men do. As for going solo -- sometimes men don't want to do more that "get off." I think you should give him some space and see if he gets back in the groove. You're gonna have to make friends with Mr. Toy until he does. If he doesn't, you'll either have to leave him for lack of sex or get it on the side. Sorry, sweetheart, but that's the truth of things.
mYAbq6fnaa	gosh, get some new friends. nobody deserves to be treated that way, especially by their two 'best friends'! no friends do that to other friends, and im sure you can find some better ones.
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Tell her that you are sorry and you'll miss her too...just be there for her...|`|Z0VvcKCraa	First, your mom would want time alone so don't pester her.  If the two of you happen to be in the same room of the house or if you pass by her room and see her awake and lonely, go up to her and put your arms around her.  Tell her you love her and you loved your grandmother, also tell her that you know she misses her dearly but now she has an angle looking down at the family and protecting al of you.|`|Pat5tSWXaa	awuh gurl , im so sorry =[  that must be hard ,  tell her how much you love her &   how much she means to you     shes always listening to what you have to say:]  & remebr shes in a better place|`|NQ8QTui5aa	let her know that you care and try to spend as much time as you can with your mom sooner or later we all face that special moment in our lives
prMwhfsxaa	Just remain grateful for all the things you parents give you including attention or any other reason people could see you as spoiled.  Don't force yourself to be the center of attention because while you probably are the center of attention to your parents other people want to be noticed too.  As long as you don't demand for things to always be your way or brag about all you have people will see you for you and not as a stereotypical only child.|`|bEypuYJ0aa	Well, the first thing you can do is to be a little more open to sharing your things with your friends.  Friends share with friends and that is one of the first steps to becoming "less of an only child".  Also, when people talk about themselves, you have to make sure that you listen too.  People with siblings can wait their turn for attention, so you should too.  You may also want to talk to your friends and ask them what bothers them about you with your "only-childness".  They would probably be glad to tell you what they would like you to improve on.  If your friends take you bad habits and all, that's even better, but try to take an example from some of your friends who have siblings (preferably your friends who are the oldest of their family, because the youngest child in the family tends to be babied, similarly to the only child).  Watch what they do in a situation that involves doing something for someone else instead of for themself.  Hope that helps!|`|6V90w2Lbaa	I think that they should spend more time with their parents and stuff instead of going out trying to do many things.  I am not saying that you should not be active and just stay inside the whole time, but once in a while you should spend time with your parents.  That one thing that annoys me that i see in only childs.|`|tnJcYdzQaa	Don't feel like your the one who is always right or in charge.
rtJTl01oaa	Bras = Boobs = Boys love them.    Tell him if he does it again you will tell your parents.|`|AA11108018	Oh yea your brother wearing it but not were you think he might|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	How old is your brother? He might be stealing your bras for sexual reasons?|`|FhzRbgFuaa	Only if he keeps doing it constently and its bugging you|`|mZlPj8Guaa	Me? I am a panties man. Do not care for bras.|`|3QIoa38Naa	I think thats a little creepy.  Either he's doing it to be annoying (whatever) he's doing it for sexual reasons (creepy) or he's a mini-drag queen.|`|AzGcXCIbaa	hmm usually its whats inside the bra's guys like idk bout the bras sounds like ur bro is wearing them or somthing ^_-
402QyLglaa	He is just being immature. It might be out of like for you, but his friends don't care for you. He might have thought of you as just friends, but its weird he would have this reaction if he did. I believe he may actually like you and now feels like a fool for not taking the chance.  If he he only wanted to be friends and reacted this way... He's just a douche.|`|wGwBpIDQaa	ughh same thing hapened to me i tell you boys ugh! cant stand em but you gotta love em:)  i think he juss wants you to talk first or that hes really done wit you, juss dont worry about him apparently god didnt want him in your life.|`|cDz6jxxnaa	That really stinks. He could be afraid to face you cuz he might know you like him and doesn't want to lead you on. But he could most definetely be a jerk too. I had a crush who did tht to me and broke mii heart.|`|bM4zYt44aa	I would say he's a little immature if you two were friends before and he's backing off because you like him.  However on the other note he may be backing off because whatever he was doing made you like him, he doesn't have the same feelings so he doesn't want to lead you on and hurt you.  You need to confront him about it.  Tell him that you understand he doesn't share your feelings but that you want to still be friends and you wont be led on or hurt by his actions, let him know you respect his right to have his own feelings but you don't want it to impact the friendship.|`|sC2aSAXaaa	This guy is probably being a jerk! Some guys just get scared when things like that happen. Especially if you've been good friends and you two feel differently about eachother. You should try sitting down and talking to him about it. He could be pushing you away because hes scared.|`|EVmIIyUAaa	He's kinda embarrassed its awkward to find out that one of your friends likes you but ignoring you for 3 months is going too far he is being a jerk but try talking it out with him eventually he'll get over it
uTdEdpAeaa	ok dude lets be realistic here... for what your asking you cannot get that for under 3500... now you can get a 1 carat  for under 3000 but the diamond is a low quality. c'mon commen sense a little please, it's like me walking into a BMW dealership and wanting buy their top of the line cars but telling them my budget is 30,000 and my mind is set on that car and nothing else or they can give me a few names of some dealerships that can be me a good price for what i'm looking for... look if you want quality and size you have to have to money to fork it up but if you don't why don't you stay in your range here and upgrade later...|`|pfagIGNSaa	If you need diamond 1 carat ring for under $3500  It has to be 10K White or Yellow Gold Diamond Solitaire Engagement Ring  You can see details at lower of this page  http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...|`|e8f507facb3ea1b18698560bfd76bcccaa	bidz.com|`|76nTvO4iaa	Try here:    http://www.bluenile.com/|`|KjF0p72naa	You'll need to look for something a bit more modest in that price range.  Any fine jewlers can help you with that. Check local listings.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	I assume you mean a 1.5 carat center diamond? You aren't gonna get that for under $3500. You could possibly get 1.5 carat total weight. Sorry to burst your bubble. Diamonds aren't cheap and a 1 carat  will start around $4000 (for decent, not great, quality).    Look into moissanite. Talk to your girlfriend about her expectations.    Edit: The cheapest 1.5 carat round diamond on bluenile is over 6k. That isn't even including the band.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I don't think that you will be happy with any 1.5 carat diamond that you can get for less than $3500.  It will likely have visible black carbon spots or clouds... and at that size, you'll be able to see them with the naked eye.  No good.  I would recommend bluenile.com as others above already have.  Here's a 1 carat diamond in your budget:    http://www.bluenile.com/round-diamond-1-...    Right now, they are having a 10% off all their settings, so you can probably pick up a nice simple setting within your budget.  I like this one:    http://www.bluenile.com/diamond-engageme...    With the 10%off, no sales tax... you may get in right at $3500.  Or you could go with a solitaire setting:    http://www.bluenile.com/diamond-engageme...    And you could upgrade to a different band later!  Just a thought!|`|k0ez34Yyaa	Try these lists of reliable companies.  http://www.theonlinejewelrystores.com|`|zaSyEcnqaa	$3500 is  a reasonable budget and you can get a nice ring for that, but you may need to revisit your criteria.   Personally, beware of overstock.com or places like that that sell everything under the sun. their diamonds are likely to be cloudy and poor grade.     First of all, you should look at white gold, not platinum for your setting.  Platinum is very expensive.  I have a platinum setting  cathedral solitaire and the setting alone with no center stone was $2500. The platinum head was another $300 . White gold is a viable option and looks really nice.     Second, you cannot get a 1.5 carat diamond for $3500. if you can manage to find one, it will have visable flaws and be poor color and cut.  My 1.5 round brilliant cost $10,500.   When we shopped diamonds, the cheapest 1.5 carat round diamond we saw was $6300 and it was not a nice diamond. It looked cloudy and dead. I would not have wanted to wear it. ( I previously had a 1.5 carat radiant that was an I in color and I think the cut was bad because it never sparkled. That diamond was $7200- we traded it in because of setting problems and I ended up with the round brilliant and love it. Cut makes all the difference. )    Better to get a smaller, higher quality diamond that sparkles and shines.  D-E-F are colorless and will cost more G-H-I-J are near colorless category and still nice stones.Anything beyond J and  you will begin to see strong yellow/brown tones.My best friend has a J color diamond and it is pretty, but I must admit it is not as sparkley or clear as my E color diamond. Hers always looks a bit dirty.   Also, consider the dimensions and cut, because a well cut diamond will sparkle and shine, where as a poorly cut diamond will look flat and dull.    Remember, that you need to spend only what you can comfortable afford. It is from your heart and your girlfriend will love and treasure it because it is from you.     Have you gone to a local jeweler and told them your budget? They should be able to work with you in finding something lovely and price-friendly.     I would also surf the diamond forum on www.pricescope.com  . There are great resources on there for diamond buying.    Beware of buying clarity enhanced diamonds. They appear to be a good deal, but are crap. They can break in half, chip and they are not worth much for replacement value.  Also, stay away from name brands for settings like Scott Kay, Tacorri, Ritani. The name alone spikes the price.     Buy what you can afford now and then down the road , you can "upgrade" if you feel the need.      Here is a very reputable site to buy from: http://www.goodoldgold.com/  The gals on pricescope rave about this.    I wanted my fiance to buy online to save money, but he insisted on buying locally so he could see the diamond and have service when needed. I must admit that I like being able to go to the jewelers and have my ring checked and cleaned.  Not to mention it has a lifetime replacement warranty and trade-in value.  So there are benefits to buying in person.     Not sue if this link will work but here is something I pulled up:  http://www.goodoldgold.com/diamondResult...    My advice would be to shoot for a really nice 1/2 carat center stone. You should be able to get a wonderful diamond for that. Then you can choose a complimentary setting with accent stones if you want more bling factor, but a classic solitaire is timeless and always beautiful.    Good luck. This is an exciting time!|`|Mn1HTfqaaa	The quality of diamond you'll get for     Try going to bluenile.com, overstock.com and buy.com to find a ring for less that she'll like and that you can be satisfied with. Perhaps you can get a setting that will allow you to change it out with a bigger diamond for an anniversary.     Good luck and best wishes!|`|W8McIIb8aa	ok im in your same boat and managed to solve my problem. I looked in shops and everythign was over priced. I finally looked online. I found the same types of rings for half the price. A great store is www.bluenile.com    Also, look online type something into google like "bluenile online coupon" and a bunch of sites will have online coupons you can use at chechout for anywhere fomr 5-25% plus remember online shopping means you dont need to pay sales tax!!!!|`|ZVcFFeEoaa	TRY ZALES...

I have used ice.com for many purchases (some were several hundred dollars, but not as pricey as this one) and I have had totally great service and products from them.    A 1.5 carat ring is going to be tough to come by in your price range.  A 1 carat ring is pretty big and most women would prefer a quality diamond over a big sized one - - it can be pretty obvious that a stone isn't great quality.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	you can go to places other than a jeweler. Like sears, jc penny, wal mart, or pawn shops. Also e bay. It shouldn't matter how much money you spend if she really loves you.|`|ZfleGhXLaa	First off, in platinum, you can't.  Platinum cost a lot more than gold, and I mean a lot.  If she doesn't wear yellow gold, look in to white gold.  If it's an allergy issue, look in to palladium.  You say you want diamonds on the setting as well?  Well, many platinum semi-mounts (Rings with no center stones) with diamonds on the band are already over your budget.    You can get a very nice ring for $3.5k.  But you need to choose between having platinum and a smaller stone, or a larger stone and a different metal.  To want a platinum ring with a 1.5k center stone, and diamonds on the band is asking too much for your budget.     http://www.bluenile.com is a reputable and reasonably priced online dealer.
tV7YYXssaa	HI,   Wow,  I am so glad I saw this question.  When my son was around 9 my ex husband didn't bother with our boys.  I felt so bad for them.  I got my older son Troy a big brother.  It was the best thing I could have done for my son.  My son is now 26 and is working for his big brothers company and he was in my sons wedding.  He has lent my son money when he needed it.  He, John did so much for my son.  I am so thankful for John you wouldn't believe.  I love him so much.  He brought so much joy into my sons life.  And there for, joy into my life.  The program is a wonderful program.  I envy anyone that does such a thing.  I don't know you but I wish you all the best.  You will be glad you did this and be rewarded for the rest of your life.  You will be someone special in a child's life.    I did get a big brother for my other younger son.  The big brother wanted to take my son to the mountains soon after they met and I said yes,  but when my son came back he said the big brother was drinking beer.  Well  that was the end of him.  I never got my other son a big brother and I regret it so much.|`|sCGWcJTFaa	Wow that's great to hear. Glad you are making a difference in your community.

They lookup to you.

VERY NICE.... you should take my path and become a poet ^^|`|U6yK3Oc3aa	intresting story X P, as long as you truly love her, her parents should not take any serious action, they will mearly think that is cute X P, the chat just made it look like you really cared for her and she does back to you, everything should work out fine for this story X D|`|epICxo9yaa	ok well im a 15 year old girl you two really seem to really like each other but her parents will prob say ur moving too fast (like they always do) hah. i dont see why she has to tell her parents though like is she going to sit down and be like mom i love this kid just for the heck of it or r you two thinking of moving to the next level and you wnt there permission/advice? Also dont worry about it!!!!!!!! If you really love this girl then it shouldnt matter what her parents think in the begining. win them over if they dont like you by doing something romantic for their daughter and giving her respect|`|QoYWBD5raa	Young love is the truest and most genuine love there is.  Adult love... that is only about commitment (though young love can be about that also), settling down, responsibility... it has to do with finances and being able to afford nice things and being able to depend on each other for money.    Young love has to do purely with your feelings, which is what love is supposed to be about, and after you go to college and get a job, you can NEVER go back to that.    About the parents; you can't expect them to accept what you have said completely.  I am 17 years old, and if I were to show MY parents  a conversation like that, they would probably freak out.  However, if you're lucky, her parents will understand.  However, most parents with a teenage girl are just going to think that you are like any other teenage boy... they're going to think all you want is... sex.  Which, from your question, I can completely see is not the case.  Perhaps you should consider showing her parents this question that you have asked... or have your girlfriend show them.  I believe, from your question, that you are an exceptional guy, who really cares about your girlfriend.  If her parents see that also, then they can have no objection to you dating their daughter.    Whatever their (your girlfriend's parents) wishes though, you need to comply.  If you go against what they say, if they tell you that you can't see her again, you have to listen.  It may be the hardest thing you've ever done, but you have to.  Otherwise, they will NEVER allow you to see her.  If you listen to their wishes, perhaps in the future, if you and your girlfriend still love each other, you can date again.    Good luck, and I hope I've helped.  This should be a movie, really.  You guys seem perfect, and it seems like you truly care about one another.    I wish I could have this kind of relationship =)    Good luck!|`|kqa9VFrfaa	TMI on this ?, but in general it is always good to have parents who like who U R dating. When we have a relationship with someone, we need support from friend and family. After all when we get married we are marrying the whole set of relatives. Haha.|`|TxIDLrjOaa	Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|`|FxpE8ivMaa	too long...anyways 15 is too young to tell. you just want to know what love is, and you won't till your older. just have fun, dont take things too seriously. enjoy yourself.|`|SUwNL9pIaa	ur weird im not reading all of that!|`|XLwHTneKaa	I think her parents could go two ways...the first think yall are just too young an need to not be so intimate...the other is they could say "wow a guy that actually cares about her" but good luck    -Hitch
RUTQTgCyaa	No one, I mean no one told me that it would take so long for me to feel comfortable being married. I thought that once my husband and I married we would fall into this automatic groove with each other. I didn't think that we would have much of an adjustment. We had been together for 4 yrs before tying the knot...I didn't think that there was anything left to learn but now touching on 5 yrs of marriage I'm still learning things about my husband that I never knew. It is truly an experience.|`|RdHED7Yhaa	I have been happily married for 28 years.  What makes it work for me is variety which is the spice of life.

bQpIctgPaa	You should gently suck on his doo-dads one at a time and then both together while gently stroking his shaft with your hand.  Do lots of licking as you move your mouth over his shaft.  Take your time and enjoy that you're making him feel better than he's used to feeling.  While he's really getting into it, swing around and essentially sit on his face, so that he can start returning the favor.  I'm serious and I'm not being crude.  This really works for me and surely for most other men as well.  You should definitely try it!|`|LMIbr1aeaa	My best recommendations is to give him when he wants it. My s life with my wife is not 100% perfect, but we both still manage to keep up with each other to compensate for percentage lost. GL|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Ask him what pleases him in bed.    We dont know him or what turns him on.    Your married and should know what turns him on by now.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	You need to talk to your husband outside the bedroom and ask him what he likes and how he likes it.  Men and women are not mind readers - if you don't communicate and talk about sex and what you like or don't like, then how in the heck can you do better and please each other?|`|EENUWAP7aa	He should not expect so much from you then.|`|BzH7l27oaa	Start working out to build up some energy and stamina like jogging or stairmaster.    Also, you really need to ask him what he likes to know the best way to please him.  You gotta open the lines of communication about sex.|`|CvwcRoYRaa	For me, what u should do and bare in mind is to be a best friends for your hubby. Try to please him well. I knew i sound hard but the main thing you should care is sex relation and your understanding with your hubby.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Easy.  1- log off of Yahoo  2- turn off the computer  3- TALK TO HIM. Not us. Seriously real fulfilling intimacy requires communication.|`|ay8X82Evaa	Well what can I say (PUT SOME WORK INTO IT) or he is just going to get it somewhere else. Lets be honest.|`|AA11447210	You need to ask him what you can do to better please him. We don't know either of you. If you get "tired and lazy" then perhaps you should work on positions that don't tire you out...and if you're too lazy find things you enjoy so you'll want to continue.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You just stop? You need to quit doing that. Finish what you started.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Hi, Ms. Chan. Try getting on your knees and practicing your oral skills. It'll do wonders for your complexion -- and marriage.|`|Whd6tqLzaa	Is your husband trying to be a good husband? Does he want to make you happy in bed and in life?     Stop worrying about it. In a marriage, both husband and wife should share the work and responsibility to make each other happy. If you are tired, you should take a break and have him help you with the household chores, so that you can have energy and time to make him and yourself happy in bed.|`|1nk8WPrtaa	Make him lay on the basement floor with no clothes on, and finger paint him. Then give him a little smack, and be on your way.
XawBWMQraa	A true friend will understand that you had no control over the situation and accept your apology. She's not worth it, if she continues to behave like that.     Probably she feels you owe her something, which i could understand to an extent, but reality is, **** happens! What you can do is offer a token of money or gift or something to show that you do take responsibility to some extent, but cannot afford to get back the computer. This way you will show her that you are truly sorry. Plus its still not your fault.    If this doesn't work, again, she's not worth it.|`|xrq4qKRbaa	Have your insurance replace it. It was your responsibility to take care of it. Even though it's not your fault that it got stolen. Replace it. That's the right thing to do.|`|rAeJ74Neaa	this is expected of a girl, shes upset cause her computer has gone and shes in shock because she must have alot of personal information and stuff on there. okay so its been 3 months now that must be enough time to get over it but if you feel that bad maybe get her another computer or something     or if your not loaded with the money like alot of us these days then get her some flowers or chocolates and show her that your sorry if this does not work then unfortunately your just gonna have to let her come to you. but then at the same time at least you tried and she will no this to. And will end up feeling guilty and realise that it wasnt your fault!! cause it wasnt and i would feel ashamed of myself if i  lost a friendship cause i was annoyed about that.|`|jyqK8Wrdaa	Thats a hard one..you should try and contact her and let her know that you understand why she is upset..because you had no control over the situation..however she should also be willing to forgive and forget..just try and get the lines of communication back open.|`|4tFuosueaa	You definitely need to talk about it. Let her know what happened and try to help her get a new computer somehow. Did you have homeowner's or renter's insurance?  File a claim?
R5mmX9Woaa	Both.  He probably cares a lot about you, and is trying to tell you that he had a one night stand. I'd stay away from the guy, he sounds like trouble, and if that is all your conversations are about you won't have such a great relationship.    Hope this Helps!

First off who said this?  Also it might be a bad thing since hes trying to open up saying hes not the most charming guy but also that every time u talk its always about sex  THAT"S CRAZY!  you should start talking about other stuff too   there are things more interesting than sex, im sure of it|`|c4Mim18qaa	not a good Choice|`|LzqUDo0oaa	Honestly i really don't know!|`|EpvkAYZdaa	XDDD..  whoah..what a flattering words    sometimes can be good ,sometimes can be bad,,,  if u get drunk ( esp. for  the man )  that would be a good idea ( i guess )    LOL
ZgcULXVjaa	First of all dude, don't give random people on the internet your phone number. Now, there are several things you can do.    - Block her number (and probably her screen name. its easier if you disappear completely)  - Ignore her calls, and if she asks about it on the internet, say you ran out of minutes or that something is wrong with your phone (ex. the ringer doesn't work, or you dont always get your calls)  - Tell her you're not much of a telephone person and you would prefer it if you could just talk over the computer from now on    Hope this helped.|`|2iU2UcmOaa	Just ignore ALL of her calls.. Don't make up excuses because she'll soon catch on that your lying. Ignore her calls and she'll get the picture sooner or later that your not interested..  Good Luck  =]|`|AA10373737	be honest, the truth will set you free!|`|RWI8Rxnhaa	meet her but with a large group of friends, act like a total idiot around her andbe a total jackass, make sure your friends are in on it though, and shell never want to speak to you again if you offend her enough|`|epICxo9yaa	DON'T IGNORE HER!!! tell her she just isnt your type and you want to go seperate ways. she sounds like she has issues so i would move on but she will respect you more if you just flat out tell her instead of playing mind games.

Practice the saddest tone u can and then call her, or wait till she calls. If she starts talking like u said yell STOP and tell her you have something u need to tell her. Tell her that ur really sorry and she seems like a really nice person and all, but u have a girlfriend, and u just realized that ur DEEPLY in love with her. Tell her that if it wouldn't be too much trouble if she could stop calling cus ur girlfriend might think that ur cheating on her. And thats it! I hope i helped, sorry if i didnt. GOOLUCK |`|4M8b5hSlaa	Clearly she is very paranoid and you might want to ask her why she keeps calling you. Good Luck|`|4pJ4y0GCaa	tell her you dont like her anymore and move on :]|`|EzpEyVnraa	Meet her, see how hot she is and then make your decsion ;)|`|Sg0gCtEAaa	**** her and get on with your life|`|KDCXd3B0aa	Aww, poor girl if you just reject her now it will be hard. But after after all, you did meet her online and you don't owe anything to her. I would take the middle ground, when she calls, only pick up every other time, and gradually get a wider and wider gap. Also, you can make exuses after about 15 minutes or so. After a while, she will take the hint, but it's kinda that way.|`|oi7XjTA0aa	give me her number!!!|`|92b56339657d2c299c47833f0ccab1e5aa	Tell her how you feel and if she back's of then cool, but if not you've got a stalker!!|`|2jvCHOKWaa	Ya, she sounds clingy and you obviously aren't that interested in the first place. Get rid of her until things get dangerous. Unless of course, "shes hurtin' for a squirtin'"|`|uogSquOyaa	Yes just tell her that you don't want her to call you anymore. Just tell her the truth, it's been known to work. If you tell her this and she still keeps calling you then, maybe get answering machine and start screening your calls.
AA10373737	When u get married!|`|KifasiMraa	I would tell her that it's something you've been interested in trying out.  If she says she's for it, then lean in and kiss her. Then you keep kissing her.  If she pulls away you'll know she's not ready.  Or she'll be OK with it and you just keep kissing.  Its easy, trust me. Your body knows what to do in these situations even if you don't.    But the minute she makes any kind of protest, you stop, got it?|`|XLwHTneKaa	Gotta wait till "the moment" this is when all girls get all emotional and you move in to make the kill which means kiss...done it plenty of times and it always works...good luck    -hitch|`|8A6A7UjLaa	When you force her too|`|01pY6dW9aa	Just take it some time..

Say "We have been going out quite some time, maybe we should take it up level?"|`|nRXMVrVAaa	well it depends on your age and stuff.|`|xfk2xMWEaa	well never force her into anything, and do it when shes ready. all people are different. if you want to though, go to a quiet place with nobody around (my ex didnt care if he kissed me with a bunch of people around) and it was weird. like go to a movie thats been out for like ever and thats shes already seen so she wont be interested....shell be interested in you.|`|Jx3TG0keaa	anytime. spontanious is good. or you can talk to her about it and plan. me and my boyfriend dated for a day and then made out the next lol|`|uoY06vSfaa	If you're not already ready to make out with this girl of yours, then the answer is NEVER.  Girls in that age range really like a guy to take charge.  They like guys who make decisions and they know what they want.  If you're concerned that you'll offend her somehow by being too forward, then chances are that you're going to MISS OUT...because by now she's probably wondering what the h3ll is wrong with you for not putting on some moves.  If you are too forward or possibly even too offensive, she'll let you know and THAT'S when you put on the brakes...what you're doing now is putting on the brakes before you even put gas in the car.    _______________________|`|8jAVByHQaa	Two months is a while so far so i would take things another step and mkout, but make sure shes ready you dont want to rush her.|`|sLaxNTHjaa	When you are both ready.

q9075Yawaa	you need a new bunch of people around you.  try getting involved with a club or group of some kind that volunteers in some way.  there are so many things that need to be done and not enough souls to do them, any help you can give will be so richly appreciated.  and the bigger bonuses are,  increased self confidence gallore, and you will meet a whole new class of true friends.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	well, because we're humans. nobody is perfect and everyone is going to let you down once in a while. but if your friends are letting you down more than they should, find some new ones. good luck on finding good friends! they're out there somewhere!|`|m2ARO4ZIaa	Your not the only one ;keep trying to see what you can do and good luck!|`|sCGWcJTFaa	It takes time for them to be comfortable with you, so don't worry.

g0NPdUm7aa	Wow, that kind of broke my heart to hear that. I mean it's cool he was honest, but not really too cool because that's hurtful. Maybe he was thinking because she is dead that you shouldn't feel sad or like it shouldn't bother you that he said that, but it's perfectly normal to feel the way you do. Now you feel like a rebound girl don't you? I totally understand, and if you were okay with what he said then there would be something wrong with you. You should tell him that what he said really bothered you. Sorry =(|`|y6HX8AfPaa	wow that would have offended me as well >=0|`|OvXqFJzMaa	WHAT A JERK! gosh......  no really!! oh my gosh!  no girl u have 2put your foot down!  the next time he tries 2 talk 2 u  u should be mad at him  and when he asks whats wrong with u   u go girl tell him the truth!  i mean u don't want 2 be with a guy  ho still is obssesed by his ex!  hope i help!|`|RZl7aPxnaa	I know he must be going threw a lot or sorrow. but to say something such as that was not right, and uncalled for. for what he was saying is that he would rather be with her if she was there, and not you. so I can see where this will make you feel as to be hurt, for he just told you he does not want you, he wants her. but I am a person that will not tell anyone they should break up. so I will just say, this is your choice to make.|`|71VRvldJaa	He really loved this girl and it's very normal and natural that he is grieving her loss.  He'd planned his future with her and it all blew up on him.  My concern is that he hasn't brought closure to this yet.  He's met you and I'm sure he really does care about you but there's bound to be part of him that feels by loving you he is probably breaking his promise to her that he would always love her.  I know you love him a lot but it really sounds to me like he's not fully ready to put the past behind him and move on.  You NEVER get over the death of someone you love, but you do get through it.  I'm sure his comment did offend you but I don't think it was said with the intention of hurting you.....he's just expressing an honest fact.....and right now that's how he feels.  As much as he loves you, you can't "replace" one person with another and it's really important that you know whether or not that's what he's trying to do.......because if he is, you will never be able to be a replacement.  You are you!.....a totally different person and he will love you in a totally different way than he loved her.  That's not saying he will love you less.....or more....just that he will love you differently!  You can't put a time limit on grief......everyone grieves in their own way and in their own time.  It's not up to you or anyone else to think or assume he should be "over it" by now!  Grieving affects you in so many different ways....mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually.  If you really and truly believe that he loves you, perhaps you just need to back off a little bit (I don't mean break up)!  I mean give him the time and space he needs to resolve how he's feeling.  The day WILL come when he IS ready to move on.  You might be the person he turns to or you might find out you've been the person who helped him get through this and he'll want to move on completely.  It's up to you whether you're willing to keep making an emotional investment into this relationship when the outcome could be uncertain for you.  Believe me when I tell you though....he's not doing this to intentionally hurt you.  If you ever need to talk or have questions, please feel free to email me.    Edit:  I did give Ash a thumbs down for her answer!  This is the exact type of judgemental comment a grieving person DOESN'T need to hear from people who have never lost someone they loved!  Like I said to you, I honestly believe he said what he did from his heart without any thought of how you would take it and be affected by it!|`|SLy9xFwkaa	sounds like he is still hurt by losing her. and honestly i think he will keep saying things like this and dragging you down to the level that he is at right now until he is over it. so its really your choice.
oAyI70W5aa	nahhh, don't.   she will try to use everything she can against you :)    answermineplease  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|X8n4Qnkeaa	hmm i would just let it sit there. do neither. bc if she finds out you denied her she'll prob be b*tchy about it. but if you don't do either then you won't have to worry about it! but then again. if you want to stalk her page and make sure he's not talking to her or commenting her pics then go on ahead. haha.     sorry that was not super helpful! good luck!|`|3Rqq6WjDaa	don't add her shes just jealous and she might try to do something to  you O.O|`|EVmIIyUAaa	reject it if she just thinks of you as a threat than she doesnt deserve to be your friend but be nice about it  (if you try to be friends with her she may try to sabatoge your chances with that boy)  (unless your not interested in him in that case confront her and tell her that)
D4e9jv0iaa	You say to your friend: "Listen, I don't want you in my party, OK, bye!"|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Since she believes you are her only best friend, she really means it and it would hurt to be rejected and have her belief stomped on    I would tell her that my parents want to have this gathering, but then I wouldn't really be able to spend the time I'd like to with her because of all the other people.     Then I'd tell her that I'd want to go out for my birthday with just the two of us so it would be special. Go to the movies or something that doesn't require her to speak to you too long.     Hope this helps. And if you were best friends, you may want to be a real friend and tell her, at another time after your b-day, how she alienates everyone and you don't want your friend to act in such a way that people won't respect her.    Good luck. Hope this helps if you try it.|`|sC2aSAXaaa	You need to talk to her about how your feeling. She should be able to understand that only a couple people are invited. But she might also be hurt because you were once good friends!|`|lwJiJOseaa	i've had the same problem!!  what i did, was invite the other friends, and not her.  see the friends that dont like her, didnt talk to her at all. so they wouldnt tell her i was having a party for my birthday.  so i say you should do the same. like if you know your friends wont tell. then have them over and have a good time. and you could tell her, you didnt really want a birthday? or that you got grounded for grades or something? and didnt get to have one.  or maybe, tell her the truth. that you really just wanted some extra close friends over.   or maybe tell her that you had already invited the ones u did invite, and you couldnt invite anymore, and u didnt want to hurt thier feelings.|`|afsanqjPaa	you should be honest with her, I dont know how truly of a friend you are, and for sure there are a lot of talking behind her back. You must be honest, no matter how hurtful it may be for her, but it wont be as bad as she will find out you backstab her. And tell her as well why you think she is not good enough of friend, that way she will learn to better herself, well...Anyhow happy birthday|`|bcfc4a553a788c7a7c8b0ab6973ab6c7aa	With people like that it's really about the time you tell them and how you go about it. Try explaining to her how she makes you feel. Remember the "I feel' part. You need to be honest with people like taht. Pick a good time and then just start with can I talk to you about something and go from there. Maybe just maybe she will see and try and change it. If you really want to stay friends give her a chance on your time. Bday may be too big of a step for her. Baby steps is how these people improve their behavior. Good luck|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Tell them that your B-Day is for your real freinds and you are just not that into them. OK lateer, call me|`|mYAbq6fnaa	well you need to find some way to tell her that she isnt your best friend. she may be annoying and clingy, but thats mean to lead her on and just let her think that. true friends make friendships work, thats all i can say. and as for the party thing, just tell her that your not really having a party this year.|`|UqvGKax1aa	Just don't invite her and go to lunch or something with her another time.|`|jNzkN6Rnaa	You need to tell her how you feel about her being clingy and tell her that its upsetting your other friends and that if she cant be a better friend you cant invite her. Me and my friend were like that and we talked and had a big cry fest and now were all better :)|`|evdYUg3paa	If she is truly a friend to you then you would want her at your Birthday. If you honestly don't want her there then she isn't really a friend to you at all now is she? If you feel this way about her then why bother to stay friends with her anyway? Just tell her how you feel and that you would prefer her not to be there... If it ruins your "friendship" who cares right? I mean she's not friendly enough to wanna be around her so why keep her around?  Good Luck|`|Gburbcuiaa	Don't have anything or schedule it on a day she isn't available. If you tell her that your parents won't let you do anything and then have other friends over, she WILL find out. If you don't want to hurt her feelings, don't do anything fr your birthday. You might also want to talk to her about how you feel that she is hurting you because she comes off as bossy and jealous. Tell her nicely.|`|gXGitS4Raa	just have confidence and just tell her in person that you need to change and also tell her i don't like it when your annoying bossy or mean to me and if she doesn't tell her your not coming to my birthday party.|`|0AOgjUxYaa	1 tell her all. Have a  sit down face too face. complete truth. she' ll be hurt and you may loose a friend but truth willhelp you later.  2 lie like a rug tell her you dont want a party and your only having a family party 3 have a family party only.this is the easiest way around it noone gets hurt. and if you are growing apart so be it let life take its course.and plan your party for next year good luck|`|TLEJruPfaa	id tell one of my friends to tell her, and if she confronts you say its true    or do wat jess q said, and tell her about her attitude|`|zUcELjQMaa	Happy almost b-day! mines in like 6 days, and i have the same problem, and a friend just like that! what i did, was whenever she asked me what i was doing, i said i wasn't sure yet. when the truth is, i sorta do have a plan....you can always fib, not a lie exactly, but tell her ur not doing anything or whatever. i said my parents only let me invite a certain number of people and since she's been over many times before, i wanted to give my other friends a chance, but she shouldn't take it personally, and maybe you'll do something to make it up later. but if 'lying' isn't really your thing, could have 2 choices. either tell her Straight out that you don't think she'd be such a great influence at your party and you don't want problems on your special day, but be nice about it; or, you could depending on how you feel towards her, and if she's that great a friend to you, you could tell her not this time. and just explain to her how you feel about how you've grown apart. a good thing to do, is also get it in the clear about how you feel about her being so bossy and whatnot. it clears up a lot of things, and it's also a way to make sure things don't get out of hand. there are ways to be nice about it, so nobody's feelings get hurt.    hope i've helped. good luck! happy birthday!!1|`|kmLKKGGyaa	if you dont want her at your party then shes not your friend. i once had a party and two of my closest friends get in a big fight and hated each other but i still invited them because they made me a promise. but i also understand what your saying ive had the same experience. if she mentions it to you say that you can only have a certain amount of people over and your mom or whoever wont make any exceptions works every time
FHrQzaPqaa	try and talk to your sister.if she does not want to hear what you got to  say about it.well you tried to tell her she will need to learn the hard  way.|`|AQBi862Jaa	I hate to say this to ya hun...but there really is nothing you can do about who she dates or not. If you tell her a piece of your mind, she will either take it into recognition or push you out of the way and not have anything to do with you for a very long time. Now, if she brings her boyfriend to your place and he treats her like ****, you have the power to kick him out because it of course is your home. I know I would not be able to tolerate any disrespectful acts in my home.|`|nOLVHNaBaa	Leave her alone.|`|R8fEO8tUaa	tell ur parents, tel his parents, tell a counselor, basically TELL TELL TELL  y dont u confront him?, but i suggest parents- both urs and his
sC2aSAXaaa	A friend shouldn't boss you around and your parents should always be there for you first. They're your family. But their is a difference in the two types of relationships. Sometimes friends do become like family though! But I do think you should sit down and talk to your friend and tell her how you feel if you haven't already, she might not realize that she is doing that.|`|y4LpyzGvaa	maybe you don't tell it nicely that's why she got angry at you...|`|EVmIIyUAaa	you did the right thing she was starting to think of you more as a slave then as a friend quiting the friend ship is about the only thing you could have done but maybe one day she'll apologize and you'll become friends again.|`|vOc6MMa7aa	WOW..........that's a hard question but i think u did the right thing  maybe you should try apologizing to her later

It just helps to bring you further apart.  But that's not to say that fantasy doesnt help.    I will use my bf and i as an example. We LOVE to role play!  We LOVE pretending things and doing things exciting together that we know we would never do in real life!  The thing is, its always him and me!  its not me pretending he is orlando bloom  and him pretending i am britney spears.  Its me pretending he is HIM as a school teacher and ME as a younger student or something really crazy.  but its still US.  All the time.  And that can add a lot of zest to a relationship.    But being someone else is not so healthy, unless both people are ok with it. Even then, it can cause a rift.  I like to say, I am pretending he is the same man, just a different career.  :)      I hope i helped.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	It may beat cheating, but not by much. Best way to fantasize about someone else is to whisper it in her ear while you're doing your job. It's a huge turn on for both. Trust me on that.|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	I have no idea.|`|1k7LIZVWaa	We don't fantasize about being with other people but we role play sometimes.  We pretend we are traveling, or we "meet" at a bar and he picks me up, buys me a few drinks, whispers sweet suggestive ideas in my ear...It drives me wild.|`|7fAHPUkkaa	beats cheating|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I agree with Suzie Q|`|6fce40fc087ca94205e0e0e2743c64f5aa	we fantasy all the time and boy does it make the sex just that much better...

fc2633d8f192d5530fac717c9c7ca3e9aa	Well I've looked at those adult classifieds on craigs list but I'm sure not going to go hook up with any of them. I guess ifor me, its just curiosity, and kind of funny, but for some, it might be an indication they may cheat. I wouldn't go to the trouble of creating a personal ad or anything.  I think it means there is an underlying issue you still have time to address before he takes the next step. I think he may be unfulfilled in some way.|`|7foornMVaa	Yeah, an interest in CHEATING.

I don't care what anyone says, these are just as (if not, more) important than taking off of school because you physically don't feel well.

You can get everything you need to file for divorce on your own with a lawyer at - http://www.legalformsbank.biz/unconteste...|`|RjpPzbBJaa	Where you were married does not matter. You are required to file in your state of residency. That usually means where you've lived at least 6 months, some states require more time.  The easiest way is to make it an uncontested divorce (one that is amicable and agreed upon) It won't require a lawyer, and takes less time (in general) than a contested one.|`|zNjACkxpaa	you get divorced in the state where you are a resident.

Most states you have to reside there for 6 months to be a resident. A divorce should not be that hard to get if you have nothing to split up in a divorce.

j2cttqpuaa	Remind your friend that no matter how much you love this other guy, there's always a difference between 'romantic love' and 'friendship love' and she'll always be in your heart, and that you'll always have time for her.  and make sure you do!

ScHW4842aa	personally,i would not involve the parentals.     you are 15. Youre not a baby anymore - and  i had some horrible things happen to me at just a year younger than you, so dont think  I am just an idiot talking about something I dont know.     If you tell your parent at this time - by sitting them down - then it will cause tension, and they wil just brush it off.     What you have to do is show this pervert that you will not tollerate his behavor, at the same time as not running and making your parents fight. I would angrily tell him (with colourful language) to stop acting like a perv. Whenever he does it after that - scream at the top of your lungs - 'get away from me - get out! stop being a perv!' so that everyone hears you and comes to find out whats going on.     He will quickly stop. He will realise you will not stay quiet, and whenver he does something - everyone will know.     if you sit everyone down and do the whole talk thing - your step father will be very offended.     good luck|`|ubofHDxPaa	Tell both of them together.|`|M6WS7dicaa	Tell your mother.

NQwljNOoaa	I think your friend is being totally ignorant.  I think it is good that your girlfriend can defend herself.  It should give you comfort that she is in less danger than someone who doesn't know  how to defend herself.  It should give you peace of mind so that you don't have to worry about her safety so much.  Why would she want or need to kick your *** unless you are abusing her? In which case you would deserve what you get if you do abuse her.  I think your friend is just insecure. I pity him if he thinks a girl has to be weak to be with.  Sounds like your girlfriend threatens your friends masculinity and he can't understand why you aren't threatened.  Stay strong and don't let him make you doubt things.|`|GOKNG35daa	SOME ADVICE MY DAD GAVE ME    NEVER LEAD A WOMEN ON A BROKEN HURT WILL DO MUCH HARM.|`|XkR2nRGGaa	im mean you should be treating her right in the first place so that right there says it all|`|kSa3t7Wtaa	Dont even worry.

Because women are running behind guys, fighting over guys, darn near paying guys to date them and taking care of them just to have a man, they have flipped the script and got y'all all confused which makes it easy for them to play their games, get what they want and leave you clueless and feeling like it was something you did causing things not to work out.

gfksposqaa	These guys are all amateurs.  I've done well more than my share of cheating, and nothing in your description concretely points to cheating, and some of it definitely seems wrong for a cheating mentality, specifically   2.      A cheater usually questions if he/she wants to stay in the relationship and would not be in a good mood around the person he/she is questioning whether they want to be with him/her.  If the person feels guilty, they would also not seem happy and chipper around you.    Your boyfriend may be enjoying a change of pace and some time doing different things.    Give me better evidence, and I'd reconsider, but based on these facts, the judge rules: innocent.|`|Un9CElCaaa	i never cheated on my mate but it sure sounds like your guy is either cheating on you or maybe he just likes someone else|`|EeJgtPRraa	I'll be honest....  my boyfriend cheated on me... i found that on his facebook... he had recieved messages from a girl... and i dont know... its like, you REALLY feel it when your boyfiend cheats on you....  He's all different, he hides his cellphone, he speaks different, he suddenly doesnt want to go to certain places, he doesnt really want to hold your hand anymore when you go out with him... he acts like a friend with you... when he gets online, he answers late and says that hes "watching tv or videos on youtube", etc....  if you want to talk about it, you can add me on this msn...   morganeleguennec@live.com    i'm a girl, but just have a fake name just in case ... ;)|`|nTJ8bKJnaa	There is a 90% chance he is cheating. Everything you list is a sign of him either cheating or looking for someone to cheat with. Face it, guys are pretty simple creatures, terrible at hiding things, especially from a female who is involved with them. We are creatures of habit and when that routine is suddenly changed it means something major is changing or has changed in our life. ANY time a guy becomes less affectionate, doesn't mind 2 weeks of not spending time with a girl, there is TROUBLE, boys are driven by hormones / sex drive. Time to prepare yourself for being single, CONFRONT him, have a face to face talk, you'll know by how he talks if he is "playing". If he is not prepared to commit 100% and stop his crap, then DUMP his cheating behind, you deserve better.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Sounds like he is.

He's cheating, but even if he wasnt, he's lost interest in your relationship and should be kicked to the curb|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	yes he is.   2   10   8 is the boss a lady, an older lady?|`|z2SODuR9aa	sounds like cheating to me..my ex was a cheater and may i add he sucked because i found out everything he did the same day he did it|`|acVPPTD2aa	I don't think he just might be bored with his daily routine.   Try doing something new and exciting together.  "2. He's suddenly in a really good mood now when I talk to him", If he is happy then there is no reason to cheat.|`|oWP2DjJoaa	I didn't cheat.     But i think he is either loosing interest.     Or most likely cheating.      One of these times he is going to dinner or to the movies. Follow him.     Do it a few times.  Maybe one of the times he WAS actually with his boss. ( his boss could be a woman. )     hope that helps. gd luck    ps: dump him anyways. he doesn't deserve you. He should be treating you better anyways. Though find out what he is really doing first.|`|YjfGt6b0aa	When i have cheated in the past (not proud) i do tend to have a gulty concience so i would try harder not switch off all together, so seems like he eather doesnt have anything to feel guilty for thus isnt cheating, or he is getting a little tired of the relationship try spicing it up a bit keep him interested, try to step a little out of you comfort zone but only if your enjoying it too.  best thing to do if symptoms presist is to just talk to him about how you feel|`|hQr9ntasaa	Ummmmmm damn.... Yah I've cheated, and yah thats how I acted :/      Reason I didn't confess, I knew what I was doing was wrong and didn't want to face it.....out of sight out of mind I guess.      Plus my girlfriend was a ***** and I was scared shitless of her.|`|AA10373737	I know that you want feedback from guys and I hope none of them are really stupid enough to relate to any of thees "symptoms"  anyway there is always one and I mean one way of knowing when someone is cheating on you and that is when you start asking yourself,  I really hope you get that.   Whats so sad about this is you've been knowing for a really long time and you even have all the evidence you really need, so what are you waiting for,  His flick to come out? @ $%^&*
o6xLWwZvaa	It's safer to take him out of the tub to spank him just in case if she did it in the tub there would no chance of him drowning, or kicking/crying and splashing water.     Overall I don't see anything wrong with spanking (depending on the age and circumstances)|`|1VVJphsAaa	Hit your kids. Thats why white kids are so corrupted cause they don't hit their kids.    BEAT YOUR KIDS.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn5jlrxcp...|`|xXWSpw5Saa	thats abuseee|`|mqpN7rXcaa	I think that kids should know who's incharge and putting them in time out doesn't work. Or would you rather be one of those parents on the nanny show?!|`|AQBi862Jaa	Wow...these days its alright to spank just as long as there are no bruises on the child afterwards. My dad used a belt on me when I was a child and I came to school in a skirt and the bruises were noticable. I guess I wanted someone to see as it was because I was too stubborn to talk to anyone about it. Next thing I knew I was called into the office by the Principle((whom I had earlier talked to about the bruises and how I got them)) and there were police officers there to take pictures of the bruises and to ask me questions. Then I hear that they went to my home to speak to my dad who happend to have the day off from work. Eventually, my dad was served some papers to go to court about this abuse and went out with just a warning, though.     Abuse happens but just a simple spanking is nothing compared to what I have gone thru with my dad and compared to what it has been like today. We dont hear much about fathers that get away with just simple belt whipping their kids...we hear more in the news about how a child was killed due to being thrown to the ground out of anger and therefore had a fractured skull...either the child lived and was therefore handicapped the rest of his/her life or the child did not live to tell his/her story. It is rediculous how this world portrays abuse as it is...because a lot of our grandparents had to suffer much worse than what I had gone thru as a little girl. Even my own dad had it hard.     Sorry, just venting. All I know is that I would do the same when it comes to just a simple spanking. The only thing that I regret about the spanking of my own kids is that they have learned how to hit others and that is not good.|`|R8fEO8tUaa	for young ages parents must resort to this  but other times its just stupid
QwLVWYkeaa	you know what, the point of having children is to produce a productive member of society.  your question reminds me of that movie Like Water for Chocolate where the youngest girl in the family was forced to stay home and stay with her mother to take care of her until she dies.  That movie was messed up because she denied herself of a passion that she craved.  I believe that children should always respect and obey their parents, however they should not be subject to their servitude for their entire life|`|F6Zh3YzXaa	I agree with you.|`|16Ta67kDaa	I agree with you, this man wasn't the most open minded person
eTxk4lSxaa	one year anniversary (wedding) is traditionally paper so get a really nice card and arrange a date at a better time inside. Women don't mind if you can't celebrate the actual date if you prove you were thinking of her and the anniversary. A bunch of flowers wouldn't hurt either and who knows? She might be able to cancel practice and you can go out and celebrate on the day anyway.    A really sweet way to do the above is get 6 roses and b4 each class give her one with part of your message on it - so at the end of the day she gets the total message|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	If she has to go to practice then she probbably realized there is no date.  Just wait until the weekend to celebrate.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Wait til the weekend when you both have more time. and anniversary does NOT need to be celebrated on the exact day.  That being said, maybe bring her a single rose or something to school so she knows you didn't forget.|`|RzeYy8dTaa	Give her a rose and a rain check for Friday or Saturday.Just tell her how much your  looking forward to then.Life happens|`|b996bdcf34d088f7d764a720874eabe3aa	You should create a scavenger hunt for her. Starting out with a note in the morning, that leads her to a friend who has another clue, that leads her to another clue, and so on... keep it going as long as you want. But in the end maybe have her present delivered to her, or have her present at her practice. Flowers? Maybe make a home-made gift certificate for dinner and a movie that weekend....
AA11447210	No, but the chances of issues with a first child increase for women when they hit 40 so she needs to be gettin' her child bearing going if she plans on having kids.    I know of plenty of women in their 40s who have had babies. I just can't imagine being 60ish when my kid was finally grown.|`|VrR9ojRRaa	No.|`|a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	any age is fine for a woman to get married and have kids as long as she will be happy!    although, realistically, i think a 60 year old woman, while having no problem getting married, will probably have to adopt a child in order to have one.|`|75f57ac567be7ececf3abf74006dc6e5aa	Is 32 her age or IQ?|`|2a522b5de6ae448a237e01246a56f3d2aa	Biologically women will be in a position to give birth to kids much older than 32.|`|1k7LIZVWaa	No.  40 is higher risk but can be done, 45 forget about the kids.|`|35f3ea990664a0076b33ba6d9059ccdcaa	yes and no. it gives a more likely chance for the children to have down syndrome. if it makes her happy, yes, because everyone needs to have some "happy times" in there life somewhere.|`|F3aBfb2aaa	no. not  old at all.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	No it's not old.  There aren't quite as many years at that age for family planning, but I didn't have my first child until I was 32 and I married at age 20.  I'm 34 now and still planning on having another one.  Women who wait until they are more mature (such as their early 30's) to marry and have children, typically turn out to be better wives and mothers, from what I have seen.|`|GLz2sX28aa	No, but you better get knocked up like, right now!  Just kidding.  After age 35, it is considered high risk says some doctors.  You can easily find out if your eggs are viable by asking your doctor if you are having doubts about your fertility.     Unfortunately for women, the quality of the eggs start to go down hill after age 27.   That is not to say healthy women in their 30's and 40's don't have healthy and strong pregnancies.    These are just statistics.  Take them or leave them.  I think your fine.  Live you life and go for what makes you happy!|`|EvzEjuOGaa	No. I was 35 when i had my first kid. Doctors consider it high risk when your first pregnancy is after age 35 and they associate it with abnormal births, you are at higher risk of getting children with Down's syndrome  etc|`|sR6vhbataa	Nope. Not at all.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Nope 32 isn't to old to get married and have kids.    There are many women in their 40's who have had a baby for the first time.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	I personally wouldn't do it but of course not. If your health is great and you can provide more power to you.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	No, not old at all.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	No...I had my daughter at 31...and would have had another, but for an accident.|`|AA11967247	no|`|kqa9VFrfaa	I was 40 & 43 when I had my girls, but the younger the better. Just remember to have sex all thru the month, and not just when the books all say to conceive. Once U R over 35 your body changes, and U can get preggp any time.|`|AA10652271	no. Not really.|`|CB30nM8Waa	Not at all. My mother had my youngest sister when she was 38. I know mothers pregnant in their 40's as well.|`|7fAHPUkkaa	she better have them fast! getting old for healthy children|`|ljwJr6u8aa	I agree with the first answer|`|T3BXC8qXaa	No, not at all. I had my kids at 27, 30, 34 and 36.|`|XGHLrOklaa	No way I was 38 when I first got married I'll be 40 this year and may try for a baby next year.  Age is only a number.|`|msNXomjTaa	My ex got pregnant with our only child when she was 37, and gave birth at 38.  The doctors treated her as a "high risk" pregnancy, as she was over 35.  They do a test to determine your body's physical age, as risks to increase as age increases.  However, 32 is not even high risk!      Early/mid 30's marriages are the norm these days it seems; don't worry about it.|`|kvcIdORcaa	My mom was 35 when I was born|`|ghz5D5iLaa	It is not too old to get married or to have kids.|`|fILk9RNYaa	No. Its never too late to get married of you are marrying for the right reasons.|`|aVbLngqmaa	no way. Women get married and have kids in their 40's.|`|e43d22697fc95b67db2cbf3fc6d74409aa	Nope.|`|eVK2zZsOaa	I don't think so,  32 is not old to me but that is because I haven't hit it yet. I think there is still time to have kids and get married. If there is a prospective husband, I say go ahead and do it. Now if there is no man in sight, I don't know but after a few years a woman gets a little to old to be making babies.
gloj01Teaa	Yes and no. You went a little overboard there, but you should always stand up for yourself. You don't want to let others think it is ok to throw rocks at you, but you don't want to become a bully either.   Yes, you threatened the kid but technically you didn't do anything to physically harm him. I would say that in this case, if he tells his parents, that would be a good thing. Then they would find out that their kid is throwing rocks at people.   Next time, do stand up for yourself, do defend yourself, but don't let your anger take over. There is a line and you don't want to cross it.   Chalk this one up to a learning experience...one of the hardest things about being a teenager is learning to control your emotions.|`|M4L3QY3gaa	You shouldn't have threatened to kill his whole family. But you could defend it with a "Heat of the moment' argument.    i think you would have been in the right if you threw the rock back at him, or really did punch him. Either way, you would have responded with even and reasonable force.|`|X8OcRh41aa	yes definitely wrong thing to do. no, he should not have have thrown the rock but u did not have to react that way. im not sure if he'll tell his parents but if he does u could get in big trouble. if i were u i would do this: next time u see him apologize. he might be scared of u but i still think u should apologize some time. hopefully soon. tell him with a mature air that throwing the rock was unnecessary, but your sorry for the things u said. don't blame him for maximum results.good luck :)
mLHW6Je1aa	Both parties have to be willing to go and do the work.|`|Bi7Zz74Baa	I tried it once. It was kind of helpful but I tried the methods mentioned in this article and found it FAR better! It was amazing! I learned how to better communicate with my husband.    http://www.hearts-and-kisses.com/marriag...|`|0AOgjUxYaa	every couple is ditterent but counseling wont hurt you , somtimes all that happens is one of you sees the light.or you are able to stop the silly cycle of little fights that surely lead  lto big fights.sitting down with a middle man can be a good thing make an appointment and go it has and is still helping me very hard at times but without the help it would be maddness    good luck|`|XTBlOf9baa	Where did you get the idea that marriage counseling can hurt your marriage? I'm a couples counselor, and, the fact is, marriage counseling can greatly help your marriage. It's all about the work the two of you are willing to put into it. Committing to counseling, learning to communicate better, applying what you discover in counseling, etc. What do you think marriage counseling is going to do, tear you apart? It doesn't work like that. In marriage counseling, most of the time it's just communicating with each other with the counselor acting as a mediator.|`|y5j97EXuaa	David Chapelle has your answer on youtube and here's the link    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZRflz-93...|`|ljwJr6u8aa	it only helps when someone can take criticism.and both want it to work. it also take a good counselor
0j18Wq6faa	It sounds like she does not know what she wants. She needs to make a decision. I think that you should talk to her and tell her how you feel. I do think that it is a good idea to not do anything else until she makes a decision regarding this other guy.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Well she is a two timer. If you are looking for something serious then I suggest you cut and run and find someone who is faithful. If you are looking for something casual like a friend with benefits then she may fit the bill. Try not to fall in love with her because you will get hurt. BTW practice safe sex.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Tell her to take a hike, and dude stop being retarded.. Think about their family instead of your pleasure ! Come on.. what do you have to gain from this ?|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Giver her the ultimatum if you don't like her exploring the field. If she leaves him for you then she does care about you. If she leaves you for him then just move on there are better women out there.|`|im9HVuWfaa	That's up to you.  If she's cheating on her boyfriend, I don't think it's a good idea.  No good can come from it. If she's dating both of you casually, you could, but if you're looking for a commitment, you won't get it now.
iWjKnMU4aa	When your crush's friend said, "Well, that's not very good," that probably means that he was going to tell you that your crush likes you, but didn't because you said you didn't. Also, his friends are being nice to you all of a sudden? Definitely a sign that he likes you.    The number one tell-tale sign, at least I think, is when you look at him and he looks right back at you and smiles, doesn't look away. This means that he's trying to show you that he likes you and he wants you to like him too. He might be intimidated, but he's probably not trying to show it. Or maybe he's just really comfortable with you! Who knows?! Talk to him more in depth and spend more time with him, and things will probably work out! By the way you described it, it seems as if he likes you! Be bold and see where that takes you!    Hope I helped, good luck! :]|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	OH EMM GEEEEEEEE  HE LIKES YOU!

Good luck    Go get'em|`|811sLIoEaa	sounds like there is nothing confusing going on at all.. sounds like he likes you plain as day.. but u screwed it up by telling his friend u never liked him    now what are u gonna do, ball is in ur court now sista|`|YAZBFnAIaa	he likes you.  but dont be too sure of it. be confident in yourself that he does and give him the signs. start talking to him more and maybe he'll get a clue.    hope you get together :)|`|q3WNhx0taa	Awe, thats soo cute! I think he likes you you should ask his friend if he likes you maybe he will tell you and then..........? If he does and doesnt ask you out be the bigger person and ask him out. you seem like me so you might be scared to ask just get over your fear. If you cant do that then just write him a note. but if you guys go out make sure your not that shy like i was in 6 grade we went out but ended of breaking up because we would barely talk and only hugged once. BEST WISHES!|`|Y6ki4IdHaa	he likes you should confront him of staring and when you two get alone ask if he wants to go out to see a movie or something|`|mKGFvY9xaa	Oooh i think he likes you.  (:|`|2imXzBHbaa	that means he wants to arm wrestle you!|`|rHLUfER3aa	this probably means he likes you which means you should start talking to him casuallly and then hell probably ask you out!|`|u3ItJv42aa	It could mean a lot of things. But the best answer I can think of is that he's trying to see if you like him.   Your CRUSH probably tried to get his friend to find out if you liked him and, when you said that you never did, the friend probably didn't like what it meant for his friend. What I'm trying to say is that your CRUSH might like you and that you made it seem like you didn't.  And the whole staring and smiling at you thing, he's probably trying to catch your attention.   So my advice is to watch how he acts around you and if you catch something special, act on it. Tell him how you feel and see how things go from there.   You get what I mean?        GOOD LUCK!  c[=
j4uTq48Eaa	Most guys are immature, and they think if they do stupid stuff like this, you will someone how want them back. They think if you hear from im daily, you won't forget about him.      What you do is set up ringtones for all your friends.So, when he calls it will be a ringtone you don't know and you won't answer the phone. You stop talking to him all together and don't answer his calls. He will eventually get the message and hopefully move on.     If he doesn't then you can contact you local police agency and get some sort of order placed against him, because if he is still calling you on a daily basis, then it could be stalking, which most police agencies take seriously.|`|9djvkpzDaa	kind off|`|GLEGh4N0aa	restraining order!!|`|cwqB4j0uaa	call the police i say|`|0KTVNTYYaa	wow. thats horrible|`|9hy9kpyhaa	threaten him or get the police involved|`|i8ySLyjLaa	harassment.|`|NXlsRNkHaa	He's obviously upset that you guys aren't together and instead of sitting down and talking to you he decided to act stupidly.

None of your children should be there, you don't know what he's like around helpless children, maybe he has a felony for child abuse, does he get drunk?. No their idiotic relationship will not last. She is an adulteress, she will come crawling back to use you -you should go to their boss and tell him [her]. At least you can expose them. Get into a good bible preaching church, find Jesus, you will find peace I promise you if you stay commited.|`|CD5JsjxKaa	well.. based on statistics it won't last. first marriages have a 50% divorce rate. second marriages have a 76% divorce rate and third marriages?? 98% divorce rate. so statistically speaking that relationship would have what we call "failing" chances.     by the way, why don't you just divorce her??

Anybody willing to go the distance, is usually a good bet to be a good worker in the job market.|`|AA11447210	The one best qualified...the associate degree guy might have more experience, or not.

AA10730095	Sometimes it is hard to make new friends when you always had your friends there whenever you went to School, but sometimes when you enter another year and you find out that your friends who you used to have around you are no longer in the same class as you, is when a Person feels lost when they see new faces around them and they do not know what to do.  When you go to your first class and you see those new faces all you have to do is to give them a smile and if they smile back at you, your instincts will be able to tell you who you can trust, or who you will be able to start a conversation with, and you take it from there.  Before you know it you will be able to have more friends than you had before.|`|l8c2kTlvaa	This happend to a lot of my friends this year, so just find somebody that you know and think of something to talk about. ask them a question and then just hang around them, talk a bit and try and seem like a happy, fun person. I'm sure they would be fine having you join their group :)  It happened to me last year, I was surprised by how many people just sat down next to me and started talking!|`|KdH3Rewaaa	Ask for a schedule change in your office, or try to meet some of the other people in your classrooms. There has to be at least 1 person who you can talk to. If it's the first time the whole class meets, quickly talk to the people who don't seem to know the other people yet. In other words, get them before someone else gets them first.

(B) find it to be very sweet and charming. or (C) get really pissed off at you, but chances are you might lose your friend. You have to weight the pros and cons. What would you gain or loose by asking her out. If the price is too high leave it alone. If you are willing to sacrifice a good friendship to know if she would ever go out with you then go for it but know that if she doesn't you could loose both your friend and her.|`|Rd3nNYNNaa	You have the right to ask out anyone you like. That girl is not your friend's personal property.You should ask her otherwise like you said its gonna play on your mind.Just give it a try.    And your friend, make him understand how much you like that girl and anyway its she who is going to chose to go out with even if you'll ask her out or not.    But dont get disappointed if she'll say no.|`|zD4CXDySaa	It depends if they both have a thing going on. But if not then you can send that card all you want. Just be sure to find out if she responds to it or not. If she does then ask her out.

EVERYONE PLEASE I NEED HELP TOO!|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	I sometimes flirt without knowing it.  My laugh just sounds like a flirty laugh.  Its not flirting but you know...    Go just be straight up.  If she is a real friend, she will not be mad.  If she's a really good friend, she will stop.|`|TBPzDU2vaa	First of all she is not a 'friend'!!

No amount of talking will change her attitude, she is too immature .. doesn't seem to know her inner self!|`|Oae9mimmaa	kick her ***.  i had a friend like her.  shell walk all over u all the time if u don't take a stand.|`|XQexuxy4aa	tell her off|`|DFw8TSmMaa	She probably likes him too. And he probly likes her, which is why she's caught in this situation. So if he likes her there's nothing you can do. If she's just throwing herself at him and then trying to pass it off as innocent when you two talk, then she clearly likes him too and doesn't just want to give him up to you just because you like him.     Get in there and get your flirt on too!!!!|`|b9MbC3Uraa	Step up to the plate and ask him out. If she is pissed or tries to steal him , what kind of friend is that? I'd say dump her but if she's ok with that then don't be mad. You probably just have good taste in men.|`|09zVUMBRaa	Dump her & him if he responded to her.  I hung out with this chick who didn't pay any attention to someone unless I liked him.  Get rid of her!!!|`|fTpk7ospaa	punch her lights out. lol  no only kidding tell her that you don't like it when she does it and ask her to stop.  Or you could when she starts to flirt do things to take his attention away from her.|`|w4kEwcpdaa	My friend does that also I'm just like girl he don't like you than finally he told her he doesn't like her that way.|`|t6MHAb55aa	flirt with him like u never did.. and flirt with ur friend too|`|1827d79e1a59bbeb213b8e03785ba568aa	well i have had a friend the same identity and eventually my husband and her ended up sleeping together. so you take it from there. i would be cautious of her...seriously!|`|Rngq461zaa	go up to her and tell her  if she wants ****, then start ****  lol|`|kQf5TbUFaa	okay wow that sounds like me i flirt with every guy and i really don't mean to at all just smile at him when you see him|`|sj87tcmqaa	why dont you start flirting with him and stuff it will get his attention|`|qW4GDpHsaa	does he know shes doing it     a real friend would not do that to you and who does he like is another question as well     just dont be friends with her anymore if it really bothers you     hope this helps     elizabeth|`|wNr9PChkaa	confront her.  again and again.  a best friend should stand beside you,  not be macking on your man!  =]|`|U4qK4YBgaa	Kick Her! and then Scream "AHAHAHAHAAAHHHHHH, You Smell LIKE Dookie!"|`|DyYzxonvaa	well...shes obviously being a bit of a bz about it, but i dont think shes doing it to be mean. i have a friend like that and its just something you have to accept about their personality even if it does suck a bit. and btw guys usually end up with the good girls, not the flirts so dont change yourself to try and compete with her overly flirtatious ways. go for it! ;)|`|3ijLQe5laa	this is the kind of friend who is not really a friend. she wants what you like. so to avoid further conflict stop telling her who you really like. fake her out, make her believe that you like someone else to see if she starts liking him too. if she does, then you know for sure what kind of person she is. also tell her you don't like him any more to see what she does, will she stop liking him?|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Listen when there's competition then there's a thrill so try to accept it but don't lose him good luck.|`|QVC6sxtJaa	I think u should get your flirt on move a little. just make sure to get your self noticed by the guy ..tell your friend ..see if this helps :)|`|TCbDO1Wnaa	Out do her when she is flirting with him that way she gets the picture you really want her to stop flirting with him|`|q5e0PYqPaa	um. stab her?|`|TGzOrftPaa	If you and the guy aren't dating then he's fair game!  She's playing the field, too, just like you.  If you talked to her about it and she said she's not flirting, well.  She's denying it.  You just have to figure out if you want to put this guy above your friendship.  Eventually if you both continue to like him, or she flirts, etc, it's going to drive a wedge between you.  And what happens if you ever started dating the guy?  From past experience (same exact situation) I can tell you that you either need to find a different guy and keep him far away from her!  or find a new friend.  It's tough.|`|r2Pk9yZMaa	Sit her down again and tell her again that you dont like it tell her you know she doesnt realize what she is doing and to watch her self around him. If she is a good freind she will stop flirting with him or watch her self when she is around him. But also you need to flirt with this guy if you like him you want to show him you have some interest in him but also play hard to get at the same time ..|`|TlghToOsaa	you don't have to tell your friend how she behaves, she's old enough to be responsible the way she act. If that so, let her do whatever she wants. And you, be positive and maintain good etiquette. I'm sure the guy is not stupid enough in noticing who is the best prospect girlfriend could be.. right?|`|g7w7hjHzaa	flirt with the guy then ..even more than she does...|`|4qbpaVv6aa	forget about the guy.

UY29sLbwaa	it might take a while. 7 years is a long time to stay mad though, that's a shame he still hasn't gotten over it. i'd be careful about the subject, but if you're uncomfortable about it, then let him know that you're a little uneasy. communication is key, on both ends.|`|oAYCestzaa	hes most likely over her|`|w1iHxDL1aa	Did he get some sexual disease from her?|`|wKvlzq2Xaa	Dude, from experience.    Go on dates, go out, meet other women.  You're not a jerk for doing it - seriously, it helps a ton.|`|5mjcHNEEaa	i would have to say that it really depends how the breakup went to determine how long it will take to get over it but 7-8 years is way too long also i would normally get over an ex if i found someone new|`|nQga7OYaaa	Speaking from experience, its possible he may never completely get over his ex.   My ex broke up with me a year ago now, and even though im in a different relationship now which im perfectly happy in, i still have some feelings for my ex, and i think i always will because she was my first love.     Its extremely hard to get over an girl who you loved, and its possible he may never, but to be honest i think that's fairly normal.    I hope this helps and good luck for the future.
NYqivyA2aa	these dreams are telling you that you need to spend more time with your boyfriend , the dream is trying to tell you that if you don't spend more time with your boyfriend then the bad dreams will go away trust me i went throught this already this will work trust me plz give me the 10 pts thanks!!|`|bcBcEYluaa	Your Sleeping.|`|voJovnboaa	woahhhh this happened to me too and sad to say we did break up. hopefully that wont happen to you.|`|Rvkpe9uaaa	maybe its a sign and u may want to start making your relations ship stronger|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	Most likely your dreams are pointing at a subconscious fear of conflict. Perhaps deep down you are really insecure about your relationship with him and its driving your anxiety levels high enough to manifest through your dreams.     You could make a dream journal where each morning when you wake up, you write down what you dreamed of that night. It doesn't matter if you cannot recall all the details. Even a short paragraph is better than nothing.     But think of your dreams as a metaphor for life. Each dream represents aspects, emotions, desires, interests and conflicts within your life and you as a person. Look at your dreams and eventually you'll begin to see patterns within them that reflect upon your day to day life.     When you dream about arguing with your bf, ask yourself how am I like this? What is it about me that has conflict like that? Ultimately your dreams are reflections of yourself only. So what you dream about is about you. Use this as a tool to find answers to what your dreams mean.|`|kp0QYdb9aa	drugs?|`|AN9PdKmgaa	you are having doubts about your relationship|`|NBf5q2f5aa	usually u dream what u think about or is confused about in reality that is usually what i dream about like what ur nervouse about|`|KjF0p72naa	Sometimes its a warning.    Sometimes it's your subsconscience expressing the feelings you refuse to address when you are awake.     Are you sensing a change? Ask him if he's feeling differently about your relationship (not about you) if you aren't feeling like a break up or break is needed. If he is feeling this way, be mature about it and don't over react.|`|bcfc4a553a788c7a7c8b0ab6973ab6c7aa	dreams tell you alot about your feeling, needs, wants, and so much more. check out a dream dictionary online. dreammoods.com|`|92yiQo7uaa	YOur dreams are telling you that boy boy is soon to be bye bye.|`|odQewFgvaa	Are you feeling insecure for some reason?|`|ZIUK6UzRaa	well you are probably just stressed out right now, and a worry is turning into anxiety and bad dreams.

Maybe you're a tad insecure and since you're really developing feelings for him you are afraid that he may leave you for someone else, or you are jealous, but don't really know it of someone else in his life that is pretty that he talks about or works with or has class with.  It could really be a lot of things.    Hope that helps.|`|MrdGGEj9aa	are you worried about him breaking up with you? it might just be your subconcious at work dont try to understand it even scientists dont know|`|IvfEtJi8aa	Don't worry. Bad dreams (or any dreams for that matter) are just the result of things we've seen or thought about while were awake. They have nothing to do about something buried deep in your consciousness or signs of things to come. They don't really mean anything outside of what we already know, so don't get caught up in dream journals and Freud.    My best advice is to think about really calming things before sleep (if you can, I know how hard that can be if you're stressed about something) and if you have lucid dreams, try to do something else. (lucid dreams are when you can control what you do and see in your dreams). There are a lot of different meditation things that can help you sleep or clear your head.    Maybe you just need to clear things up in real life, and your dreams will settle down.|`|A6PJEW44aa	ur mind is in an unconscious state therefor no boundaries   wat all that means is that u keep thinking wat might happen so ur dreams are making a scenario of it|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Do you have subconscious ( or conscious) concerns about your relationship?

zNjACkxpaa	I think you know when you realize that you just don't care any more. The opposite of love is indifference. Or relief.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Everything changes -- especially marriages. U do not give enough details here for good answer. I have struggled for 21 years not getting what I need out of the relationship -- partly because I am too shy to speak up about what I need. My husband has threatened me with divorce many times, and I feel like I want to run away more and more. But my sisters are begging me not to because of how hard it will be to live on my own again. We are still being polite to each other, but there are some really bad days where I say things I don't want to say because they come out wrong when I am upset. Communication is the key, and unfortunately men and women speak a different language. I am currently reading some books on marriage, and getting ready to go to a new counselor. We all change all of our lives. The trick is to respect each other even in your differences. I wish I could help U more, but U do not say exactly what is going on.  Every day is a struggle for me with teens around -- that is what triggers most of the fights between hubby and me -- I am conservative & he is liberal. I am learning to keep my mouth shut until I calm down. Always goes better later when we can talk more sensibly. Try to read up on something that can help you, so that U R not ending up alone.|`|w2Z1SV1Gaa	For my husband and I, the only things we agreed could never be forgiven or worked out is infidelity (physical, emotional, etc.) and abuse.

If you are always feeling resentment towards you husband you are no longer being fair to him, or yourself. Just make sure the problems are not able to be fixed.   Adultery, abuse and money are the biggest reasons for a divorce but almost anything can be fixed if you try hard enough.    if it is about cheating, the odds are against you.  If there have been lies or any knd of abuse, it may be best to walk away.  But if its something that can be worked on, make sure you try it all first.|`|GLz2sX28aa	I'm a divorce' and I think the only reason to leave is because you absolutely HAVE to....for your health, for survival, for the kids, whatever.

EASY.No difference. What might be a pretty girl to me might be a hot girl to another to another.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	my "Boyfriend" *makes mean face* calls me hot.  I find it degrating.  I'm a freaking 13 year old girl in grade 8.  I would not like being called hot on a daily basis.  This guy PISSES me off all of the time..  Its basically "You look so amazing.  I want in your pants.. NOW!"  Pretty is what i love being called.  It's basically just a "You look really nice."  Not the sexual term!  BLAHHH|`|VrR9ojRRaa	Is the question:    From a guys point of view when you call a girl pretty or hot, is there a difference?    In my opinion, Yes. Pretty to me means sweet and nice, whereas Hot means sexual and erotic.    hope I helped.|`|H4VFi6HGaa	well like pretty or beautiful these days is thrown around like crazy. coming from a guy it can either be just to sweet talk his way in ur pants or it can mean hes being real.  now hot on the other hand would show how a guys feels twards a girl who he wants to u know..get ur number..maybe hook up..but it might not be. u never know. hope this helps. :]|`|IHT1QGzoaa	i usally use cut cuz i dont wanna make the girl think im upsessed but hot is more of a girl with a nice body and pretty face while pretty may be similar u may not have that umph factor and personality plays a role too|`|3ijLQe5laa	its like this  some girls are soft, so guys call them pretty (which is what all girls wish to be) these are the girls that guys want to marry  some girls have sex appeal, and those are sexy or hot girls, these are the chicks that guys want to bang   and then you have etc.   the idea is having enough confidence on the inside to feel pretty. it will exude, and if you fell pretty then when you look real good you will be hot. feel hot look hot/feel pretty look pretty and vise versa. its a little more to it but basically that is what guys mean. but it is more of whats on the inside of you|`|McOF0DVnaa	i know exactly what you are talking about.  i use those terms all the time, and yes there is a difference.  when a guy sees a girl that has a lot of sex appeal, that when we say a girl is hot.  it is a compliment, but for most cases just means that we would like to get in her pants lol.  now if a guy says "wow that girl is really pretty," that is a different story.  if a girl is pretty, she may still have sex appeal, but there is something innocent and different about her. its not just a physical appeal, but also a mental one.  that would be the girl you would like to meet and actuall start a relationship with.  hope that helps|`|s6e4bqahaa	Hot in my opinion is more like dress style...looking a tad idk "slutty" for lack of a better word!Uh..Hot=sexy....Pretty in my opinion is more like the girl next door you always wanted..not neccessarily "plain jane"  But not beautiful or exotic either...Pretty=cute & innocent|`|K3AfzbR8aa	yea pretty is more about ur face same as cute ...hot is more about ur body shape.... :D....|`|45UTKuamaa	I know a young lady that i think is very pretty.tall slender long blond hair, etc. recently saw her in s sexy black dress with all the make up and she looked hot. a man killer!  So i'd say the clothes and make up made the difference.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Yeah. Hot and sexy pertain more to the sexual beauty of a girl.  Cute and adorable describe the childlike beauty of a girl.  Beautiful and pretty are in between.    That's how I describe girls, anyways.  Hot and sexy are degrading, in my opinion, though.|`|Qc3bu3ioaa	yes they would! trust me!|`|31eKG6Hraa	When I call a girl pretty it is not a knock on them by anymeans, but it's usually a girl that is a natural beauty or she is more wholesome.  For instance, Jennifer Garner or Jennifer Aniston, I would say pretty, not hot.  Not that they aren't hot, but I reserve that adjective for girls that you see at a club or in a bikini contest.  Hot usually is like for girls all made up with makeup or slutty clothes etc.  I would see someone like old school Pam Anderson or Carmen Electra and think hot, they are attractive you know, but not in the classy type of way like Anniston or Garner.  Does that make sense?|`|pvd3V8ppaa	I seem to be the exception, but I think that unless I was really concentrating and decided that using exactly the right words was crucial (though if that was the case I'd be stuffed) which word I used probably wouldn't mean something different.   Actually ignore me, thinking about it further I suck at compliments and don't really have a clue. ha|`|1DBW6w3Eaa	I would say that HOT is used in a sexual way as in the body, PRETTY is used when you think the girl is nice and a good person but has good looks, BEAUTIFUL is when a girl walks through the halls and you go Whoah... their beauty just radiates off of them.    I personally like a girl who is pretty/hott but doesn't think of herself as hott, is kind and has good manners.|`|iR7StHksaa	I would prefer a guy 2 call me pretty i makes me feel like they want to get 2 know me better and that it is not about my looks.
fFCNZrLKaa	if you did most of the work then honestly you should get all the money. if this was my sister i would tell her to just let me do it because she wasnt even the one who got asked to babysit. or you could give her like 10 dollars for helping. i wouldnt give her anything though. lol|`|pdW8jMQoaa	30% sounds more reasonable|`|4Nbiuj6Gaa	My boyfriend and I sometimes have to babysit his nephew. We get $20 for doing so, but my boyfriend always says that I should have it because i'm doing most or all of the babysitting.     If you've been the one who did the job, or most of it - then you should be the one paid, in full.|`|oxWpo4bqaa	Give her five bucks.    Tell her that she should have made the agreement beforehand but you appreciate her help.|`|a0u5xIzKaa	THAT IS SOOOOOO NOT FAIR!!!!   I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD GET ALL THE MONEY BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL IT WASNT ANY OF HER BUISSNESS AND YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO IT AND NOT HER SO I DONT KNOW WAT SHES TALKING ABOUT!!! LOL!!|`|Tqof0Frnaa	If she's seventeen she should be more mature (not that you're a baby), and see that you did more work - not to forget the part where you never asked for her help. Talk it over with the folks or whoever's paying you as well as your sister. And if she does get half, then next time make it a point that you don't need help.|`|RETojQIaaa	it's fine.. anyway she's your sister.. be generous..|`|c0jZMs5Gaa	if you did all the work then why should you split half with her you should keep the whole 50 bucks to yourself|`|prW1i0vzaa	That is NOT fair. You were the one who did most of the work, and you were the only person who was supposed to get paid in the first place. If your sister wanted to help, she shouldn't have assumed she was going to get paid.|`|16Ta67kDaa	I know the feeling of having a pushy sister, you don't have to give her anything. you didn't ask for help and you did most of the work. its your choice, but I personally would keep the cash for myself.|`|hbFH7FZFaa	Lil' Bro...keep $35 and give her $15. That should satisfy her. If not.....Plan B, (I got you bro) split the money with big sis and "get" her to buy something for you with her share.You know how to work it. :-)|`|N2xzSXosaa	She's your sister.    It's not right but it will save you a lot less hassel.  Just throw a 20 her way and call it even. Keep 80. Afterall, you didn't ask for her help.|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	you should get all the money she only anted to help to get half, and apparently she didnt do much, and you didnt offer her this, she cant just take your money, and when she said she wanted to help she didnt say, "if i help then you have to give me half" so she cant just demmand it now, she WAS working for free|`|5RzhT1Ctaa	You should get it all. She was tryin' to help when you didn't want her too.|`|MOJPWkg1aa	nooo!!!!!! because she's older! n plus if u didnt ask her for help then dont share
nn7cxOruaa	Don't give up, don't ever give up! I had depression problems a few years ago. I would cry every night, and everything would just put me down. It seemed like I was just dragging myself out of bed in the morning. I didn't even feel connected to my own body. I felt like giving up. Please, hear me when I say, that suicide is never the answer. I know that you're feeling like there is nothing that will ever make you feel good again. Just because you are reading this, though, means that deep inside, amidst all that pain and sadness, there is hope. Even the tiniest glimmer of it. Keep holding on, because if you give up, you will never feel the relief that comes when you finally feel happy again. Suicide only brings incredible devastation to family members, friends, and people you don't even know! It changes lives forever, not just yours. Please, email me if you need to talk, because I do care! Also, it really really helps to talk to a psychologist or therapist. Just getting some of those awful feelings out helps get rid of the anxiety. Please, don't give up. You have got so much to live for!
eVK2zZsOaa	Maybe the job is stressing him out or something is stressing him out and he taking it out on you and everybody around him. He could also be homesick and not used to the new living environment. Whenever he gets like that just give him his space. Whenever I see my husband in a bad mood, I just let him have time to his self and then if he wants to talk about it, I usually let him come to me. If you guys are going through a rough patch in marriage maybe you could suggest marriage counseling if you feel that it is something that you can't work out on your own. See if he will be willing to talk to someone about the problems you are having.|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	Stop being submissive.  It's time to get a little more control!      Sit him down and talk to him.  Ask him what's going on.  Tell him you've noticed he's been a little more stressed lately and you want to know what you can do to help.  You've been trying to take care of the home and help fulfill him but, you still seem stressed.    As for the car...wow, hard one.  Bottom line: he's going to hurt someone or himself if he contines.  You don't want him to get hurt or your car destroyed or insurance rates up.  If he doesn't stop this behavior you really need to think about letting him drive your car.  If you have your own car don't let him drive it.  If he doesn't take you seriously don't ride with him.  You only ride w/ people you feel safe w/.  Maybe that will help him know you're serious.    Sit down and talk about what is going on.  Marriage is a lot of work but, don't forget to tell each other how much love there is and have fun.    Good luck!|`|AA11431313	I have a few thoughts that come to mind but I'm not sure how much guidance I can give you, maybe this will help anyway.    The negativity about people being fat or stupid makes me think that he is feeling insecure about something and this is his way of making himself feel better.  Perhaps he is feeling inadequate within in his new job.    Try to get him to see that the speeding tickets could jeopardize your future and that he has a responsibility to your future as a couple.    The submissive and clean house thing--when my husband is in a mood like that, being submissive and such just pisses him off even more.  Let him know that you are not going to be his emotional punching bag.  Also tell him that you really enjoy having sex with him but all this negativity lately is really putting a damper on your mood.    When he does ***** about something or someone, agree with him.  Tell him how much that annoys you too. See what happens.    Maybe you could offer him a treat, like if you slow down for me, than when we get home we will (some sort of sexual act) in the car before we get inside--or whatever--you get the idea.|`|vj2pWs9Maa	People who drive so erratically have no respect for anyone - not their passengers nor anyone else on the road.  Bad driving really gets on my nerves, because his bad driving could result in someone's death.    If you hate it that much, you need to get over your fear of driving and get behind the wheel.  Wouldn't you feel safer knowing your abilities as a driver? It's the best thing! I don't know how people can get through life without driving, especially if they have, or intend to have children.    You have independence, you can go wherever you want when you like.    Maybe he is stressed, but there is no excuse for unsafe driving.  Ask him what's going on.  Being submissive isn't the answer.  Good luck!|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Yeah, there is something going on.  Along with telling him that the driving is scary to you and you feel like your safety is in jeopardy, you two need to see a counselor.  Although it sounds like he wont be up to it...try going alone for a while and see if he will be willing to come with you.  You guys need some time to be able to talk about things and get some felings out.  He is not treating you as a husband should treat a wife and you deserve to be on equal grounds with him.    Good luck.  I sure hope things get better for the both of you!!|`|o2GmpkvRaa	Sounds like he has anger management problems and a bit a depress. He should see a Professional for help.
Tqof0Frnaa	It seems like this person is either really immature or - no offense - doesn't appreciate your presence anymore. I think it's not a question of right or wrong, but what you do in response. I say you should just forget about the person - if they miss you or wish to get in contact with you they'll do it.
ljwJr6u8aa	sorry,I don't know hin|`|f91c3c56fab52fa3b6e292e4b22470f7aa	im pretty sure ur not married, so this questions baffles me.... anyways, if he doesnt see you, then maybe u should check to make sure u wiped off all that invisibility cream, those little suckers can be tricky!
ZJd0OM0caa	most girls dont like it when u say there full name ....  but to tell u the truth u got a good way going with this but . its too long make it a little shorter and dont make it so .... nerdy make it lovley and make her want to melt inside:D all a girl asks for is a kind and loving guy and if u re write this from your heart then she jus might go out with u :D|`|wELk6tF1aa	i didnt get the letter its to long i hate teading long numbers|`|kmLKKGGyaa	sorry i didnt understand it and im a whiz at stuff like that. maybe just shorten a bit otherwise very sweet
7obFZ2Gyaa	sounds like your just curious about  girls thats all. I mean  I am a guy and I can't help but look at  other guys but not their privates though.   I wouldn't worry about it and even if you are bi sexual   there's nothing wrong with it.|`|ia2Ncw0taa	Jealous maybe cause you want what you don't have enough of. Or maybe your bisexual|`|xRoDyYCWaa	Don't worry about it. You could just think they are an attractive person. It doesn't mean that you are Bi at all. Especially at your age, your just curious at this stage and wondering about things.|`|AmPi1Khvaa	nah your probably not bi or anything. when i was 12 i would look at other girls just to compare and i couldn't help it. like this person has a bigger but or this person has bigger boobs. its no biggie. just relax|`|CN4QDGbwaa	thats a normal thing to do at your age.. around 12 girls are always comparing them selves to other girls and maby you are doing it subconciously...|`|1wb9rotSaa	I would not worry about it.  It's not like if you're straight you are forbidden to look at any other part of a girl except her face.  I am completely stright and sometimes I find myself looking at a girls chest thinking to myself "whow, she has big boobs".  I guess if it excites you sexually than you might be a bit bi.  Did this help?|`|VGzi6KaFaa	maybe your bi|`|k2XDk0WDaa	i think ur just interested not in like a liking type of just a curious type of way wouldn't worry about it|`|hyCw0Qyaaa	bicurious i guess  it possible your bi, but only if you find girls attractive.|`|UgLCcEpLaa	My advice to you is this. Dont get confused , regardless of what the internet, newspapers, tv ads media or doctors tell you. Man was created to be with a woman and the same applies with women. Many bisexual or gay people end up very messed up in the head later in life becasue they turn to drugs for answers...in turn this takes them to an even darker place. THe world today as we know it is full of subtle advertsing designed to program the human mind into a mixed up program that just spends money and doesnt ask the important questions of life. This system has a force of evil behind it trying to control people....luckily we have some forces of good fightling back...Be careful and be very alert in this world of sin that has an evil manipulation willing to deceive ad corrupt your mind at any moment in any form. The mind is your souls tool, dont let it control the soul but let the soul control the mind. I wish you luck and I hope you manage to surround yourself with some good people, take care
RJY6aRQ9aa	Just sounds like your bored of the routine of it. Saying 'I love you' means nothing, anybody can say that to anyone. Love is the kind of thing where actions count more.    I would just like to point out you have contradicted yourself in one sentence "i love him dearly, but are we still in love?"    As for you not seeing each other every day, I would find it weird to see a guy that much, my life isn't the guy I go out with, I have friends I spend day's with them and family sometimes I just want to spend time by myself, it doesn't mean that I don't love the other people in my life. Anyway, if you spent all your time together you would have very little to talk about, except for maybe repeatedly saying 'I love you' with get quite dull after a while.      If this doesn't make a lot of sense it's because it's 3am here and I've had a nice amount of drinks.    Edit:  Ye but if your crying at the thought, well then as I said actions speak louder than words|`|XkR2nRGGaa	no it jus might be that you "fire" needs new fuel go out take trips or better yet me and my gf like to first take a date to go LOOK for good restruants to go eat at and then we make another date to go to them idk but we love it|`|8OSdPa5iaa	I hate to say this but, it sounds like you two need to see new people. It does sound like you are.    I'm sorry to hear it.|`|GtGy8Nupaa	I think you should separate from him for a while and see how you feel.  If you truly love him, you will definitely go back to him and realize how important he is to you.|`|16Ta67kDaa	I'm sorry to say but it seems like it. But if you think you truly love him try taking a short separation, if its love then you guys will get back together|`|hCIAD98Zaa	No your love isn't fading . there's just no spice in the relationship. Maybe you guys should stop with the " I love you " and do something different for a change.     Of course it's normal !You guys have been together for a year , perhaps you and your boyfriend did mostly everything a couple would do and now it become nothing new for you .    Instead of just sitting together , you can make fun activities that put you guys active and boost up the relationship.You should begin to be more like " friends " you know , stop with the love stuff , it's like you guys already know you're in love why express it all the time!|`|APfGA9sNaa	yes|`|aJ7y5V6Saa	um idk talk to him bout that|`|6u8D2iZ4aa	Sounds like your bored and he is comfortable|`|1qa4JBL4aa	that depends. do u still mean it when you say i love you? maybe you guys are just a little bit tired of each other from spending so much time together. maybe just don'tt spend so much time together. only a little bit until you decide you miss each other so much :)|`|GOYPKp3Baa	It kinda sounds like you are!
vYSGHKbZaa	I'm a wedding planner and my clients are always searching for the perfect favor? Are you in America? Cos if you are then it is spring and seeds are a great inexpensive option.    You could purchase seeds (maybe a flower that blossoms yellow and white... or anything pretty). Then you could either make a material pouch and tie it with a ribbon and a little card wich has your names and a little clever line about growing love or blossoming happiness ect.    You can also make your own paper and place the seeds in the mix, when it sets you can cut it out into a relevant shape or scroll it up and tie it again with a ribbon and a tab (which also explains that you should plant the whole scroll and wait for it to blossom.    I just think the seeds are a great idea. they are very very affordable and it's something your guests can take home with them and actually use long after the wedding. Remembering your special day.    Sure alot of people won't plant them but your aunts and grandmothers will treasure them and your friends and family will think they are really sweet.    Hope that helps.... Look on the Knot.com aswell they have heaps of really cheap and clever items.|`|6uEmRe7Naa	Hey there, take a look at these ideas...    http://www.pwponline.com/lemonade-weddin...  http://www.pwponline.com/sweet-couple-cc...  http://www.pwponline.com/wedding-favors-...  http://www.theweddingfavorbar.com/eb2001...|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Perhaps you could order specialized M&M's and wrap some in colored plastic wrap with a ribbon.    Traditional favors in Italian families are the colored or white candy coated almonds.    Try Jo-Ann Fabrics, Michael's, or other craft stores. They have wonderful wedding ideas.    Best of luck to you and yours.|`|0d1ab34e7d8e6be1528a2d3ee4038e39aa	I'd give the children drawing pads and crayons or markers to help keep them busy during the reception.  Small, inexpensive toys would make a great idea for them also.    There are so many ideas for the adults.  Little baggies of cookies or candies in your colors might be one of the least expensive ways to go.  Although there are lots of good ideas at http://www.sandiego-romantics.com/weddin...  I kind of like a wine stopper.  It's practical and inexpensive.  You could give one per couple.|`|gzzgeX3Aaa	You could make the classic boxes of chocolates or a special kind of candy. These are both a favorite with adults and kids. To make them extra special use clear boxes and tie them with a white and/or yellow ribbon.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Head to Michael's and just browse around, see what you can come up with.  For ours we are doing nice baggies with jelly beans in our wedding colours. You could have white and yellow jelly beans for example.  We are getting our bags for $2 at the dollar store. and all the jelly beans for about $15 at Bulk Barn.  This'll cover 65 people, for us.  This way it's not something people will throw out as soon as they get home.  And if you wish, print off some tags and attach them too.    OR what about getting some nice large candles in your colour (yellow) and wrapping them with a nice cellophane and add a tag with your name and date.  At least 1/2 the people will use that.  Good luck|`|hiY7CCc7aa	We gave our guests servette holders - very plain but everyone liked them|`|bnhp1pxAaa	You can do a candy "Bar" Go to my website and click on about me. Scroll to the bottom and view all of my pictures.  There is one with containers for different types of candy.  It's a lot of fun.  If you need help with this, send me an email through my website and I can help you.|`|rzdhy94laa	http://www.wrapwithus.com/?gclid=CPCftfi...|`|fc5KHr6aaa	I think a burned cd is a great idea! I really wanted to do this for my wedding, but we just ran out of time. You could put a few songs from the wedding, you and your fiance's favorite songs, etc. I went to one wedding where each of the bridal party had picked a song that reminded them of the couple. So, the cd read "Adam's song: _____" etc. Also, if you are having out of town guests it is fun to put songs that have your state in them. For a Tennessee wedding, one of my friends did "Walking in Memphis" and several others.  I guess if you don't already have a cd burner and label maker it could be expensive. But it is creative, fun, and personal!
ARLr7k0Faa	My Skin by Natalie Merchant maybe?     Misery Business is about friends/best friends but it works...    One song that really comes to mind is Face Down by Redjumpsuit Apparatus but thats about a guy mistreating a girl...|`|AA11263103	cold as you by taylor swift   IT really helps you even if its about a guy (the song.)
IHT1QGzoaa	wut u said might've been a little over the top u should just called him cute back but he seems interested just keep talking to him show that ur interested dont play hard to get|`|Mzjoeld4aa	maybe he just thinks of you as one of his homies lol like to joke with but still there could be a chance he likes u|`|M8f4BorPaa	he sounds a bit interseted. JUUUST WAIT N ULL SEE|`|ks2oieV0aa	Just wait and see if he calls.  xox|`|hQr9ntasaa	posting you twos conversation is a good way to make him not like you.    Whether he calls or not is not an issue..... if you check out the question I just recently asked, we tend to be pissed off by phone calls.
OuQJYm4zaa	First, get some of your friends together  and get them to start up a conversation and put in your little input  here and there.  Since you got your posse with you, have total confidence because  they have your back, and should have it no matter what.  They should be supportive and help you follow through in talking to this kid.  You shouldn't be so intimidated, he's ust a regular person like you,  so try thinking of yourself highly. Ask him about music he's into,  shows, movies, whtever sticks out about him.  they may be obvious but you've got to break the ice somehow.  just be yourself.|`|WchGezIAaa	your gunna need that confidence you think you dont have.     the best way to make any guy want you, is to look confidant, together (as in no emotional baggage). engage him so he thinks your slightly interested and then ignore the crap out of him. but throw him teasers every now and then.     guys like the chase. its what makes a girl attractive is to know that she is amazing and seemingly unattainable.|`|TQlQ6zbwaa	face him! you'll never talk to him if you just run away from him!|`|KBXJeIKtaa	You have to talk to him find out what he likes and be yourself|`|9FL1w7UVaa	Don't be shy. Just go up to him and talk to him. I know it seems imbarassing but trust me, guys love it when girls aren't shy and just come up to them and talk to them, hes a guy and won't give a crap if you ask him out or anything of the sort.|`|igkbUflbaa	If ur waaaaayyyyyyy to shy 4 ur own good then first you need to get less shy. Otherwise you'll never get anything you want.|`|jjKbw2KCaa	You answered your own question.  You've never talked to him.  You NEED to talk to him.  Strt out simple, just say he whatsup, or friend request him on myspace or something|`|MjJUybHPaa	Just act like yourself, just be yourself|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Show direct interest on him by some flirting and hi or some sort, if things works out ok if not don't try to force on him.|`|nQga7OYaaa	Drop him a hint, it works wonders because it will get him thinking about you.|`|KFXnVsTdaa	If you got good assets , show it to him|`|CBYFTjXHaa	i am the same way but i got over it.    you should just go for it..talk to him.get to know him.  but if your really that shy then have your friends talk to him for you so that way he an see that your kinda interested in him..    wear things that get you noticed.  :)|`|mzkfSwLwaa	First of all you "cant" make someone like you. Ask him straight up if he have any feelings for you.|`|AA10140520	Get to know him more; talk to him, give him the attention he likes,-good luck.|`|A6PJEW44aa	yeah i go with Lith
AA11248450	He sounds like a nice guy. If you like him go back to him. But then I'm sure there was a reason you broke up in the first place. Talk to him. Good Luck.|`|d09d636d7ee51e3ee6fab5d0ec5f9d82aa	i have a guy like this. Even though i have a fiance he, well, holds me in very high regard. Sometimes your ex is the only one in your life who knows you best and was there for you during the hard times. Just make sure you are encouraging him to date and not monopolizing ALL his social time. I help my guy friend with his girl issues all the time. Sometimes he says stuff like " man, i should have just married you" but we know where we stand. its cool. I wouldnt assume too much if i were you.     i mean do you want him back? maybe you should make the move...|`|oeEsnwSMaa	Don't Know, time will tell
fMEypXDYaa	You busted him, and yes your entitled to know what he was doing in the computer room after all it is not like it some kind of secret place or anything? He had no right to shut you out like that, and he needs to know that from you.|`|t9c4vOZmaa	First it's porn then it's other sites then on to other things been there done that! Not all guys do this I know a lot who don't. In my opinion when someone was lying to me as many guys have in the past about this they were also lying to me about other things. Your dense to believe otherwise.|`|rDmMk9Soaa	Ok, so you know he's watching porn, and you know he's ashamed of himself. So just tell him you are ok with his hobby, and leave him alone. You are putting him in a position where he feels the need to lie. Stop asking. I take it that your watching it with him would be out of the question since there is that much shame surrounding his hobby for both of you, but watching porn together is a great way to communicate your likes and dislikes. It's a shame you can't communicate better. Maybe that is what you need to work on without bringing up his computer habit.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	He lies about it because guys are programmed to lie about it. (How many times do you think he wacked off as a teen and hid it from his mother) You keep backing him into a corner about it, and he lies to protect himself. You say you want the truth but I have a feeling that what you really want is control.     If you don't have a problem with it then why are you backing him into a corner and checking the computer history? Just accept that he watches porn and relax. Let him have some personal, private time.     If you really are as accepting as you say then back off, and let him learn that it's okay to not hide it. He just has to unlearn some old habits and he's never going to do it if you treat your marriage as a parent/child relationship. He is an adult engaging in perfectly legal adult activity. Be an adult as well and give him some space. Men need a little more time than we do to open up like that. When he does, it's a great thing but you need to be patient.     Good luck :)|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	lying is just wrong, i say just admit you are doing it ,   i do not understand why men lie anyways i am going thru this with my hubbie with his pain med addiction, if they lie about stupid crap i often wonder what they will lie about other wise,,  . the last lie i caught him in i packed up and went to away for a week and made him wonder if i was coming back it changed things for a while but here we are in the same boat again this time i ain't coming back|`|m13CCGc1aa	Maybe you should look at porn together.  Why does he have to hide it?  I go in streaks of being jealous of porn but I realize that jealousy is stupid.    As long as he isn't chatting with other women or doing like cam chat or something, don't hassel him about it.    Tell him after he looks at it to just delete the history so that if you look you won't find anything.  It will deter a lot of arguments.    As long as it isn't taking away from time you would have spent together or costing money, let it go.    And as far as the lying, he obviously was lying because he knew you'd throw a fit about it.  I'm not saying that it was right for him to lie, but now you are using him lying as an excuse to why you are really mad when you are still really mad about the porn.|`|AA11205004	Porn can be a big issue. I feel like you. My hubby has lied to me and i've caught him looking as well. I try to accept he will look and it's normal. But I am insecure somewhat which makes it suck even more. I think it's the hiding and secrets that make it worse. Best wishes.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	First, he is watching Porn! So quit asking him if he is watching it! He needs help! Good luck|`|jAGwyyuyaa	You sound like his mother, trying to teach him a lesson. Leave him alone about it. Respect his privacy. as long as he's just lookin' what harm is he doing?|`|qwCqhn61aa	He gets off being sneeky. Watch out he  Will cheat givin the opporturnity.|`|85JjEHU1aa	Be glad its porn Not another woman!|`|0AOgjUxYaa	addiction is addiction booze or porn its all the same i think when you hide it or lie about it its become a problem Alanon for you ,helps you learn how to deal with any addiction you cant change him only yourself  ilove counseling try it good luck|`|edzpGxXSaa	Pornography is an addiction for many men. The issue is not about sex, physical need, or physiological dysfunction. It's about the matter of heart or the soul. We become captive to the this sin, and marriages are often destroyed by it.    If anyone tells you that's it's okay to look at pornography, it's a lie. It's straight up adultery. This is state directly as gratification of the flesh and lust of this world. Men are dead to this sin which causes deception as you have surely noticed. It leads hatred, loneliness, bitterness, and death.    Your husband and you probably don't really know how dead he is. There is a source of living water which satisfy the soul. It quenches the burn. It sets captive men free and bring abundant everlasting life.    I pray you find it like I have found Him.|`|J4W68owgaa	I'm not advocating lying, but my guess is your husband is lying because he's ashamed and embarrassed.    Ask him if he'd be willing to see a counselor about his porn addiction and assure him you aren't angry, just concerned about him.|`|NYnTs7Bgaa	If it doesn't effect your love life, you might want to ask him if you can look at it with him? You just want the lies to stop. It might make you feel better if you could see exactly what he is looking at.   If he has a problem with that he could be doing more then just looking he might be in a chat room. I do feel chatting is cheating.|`|WewCtMpzaa	The porn thing sounds like a stress point. He probably feels or knows it will not be accepted. If you accept it and share it with him, he will not freak out.     He's taking desperate steps to conceal it.    It's only an addiction if more than twice a day...|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	maybe its the type of porn he is looking at that he is embarrassed about and doesn't want you to know what he watches.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	He is lying because he is embarrassed. He will probably not stop at this point -- not without help anyway. My one sister has this problem and she decided to live with it as long as he was discrete, and they still had some kind of sex life together. It was a hard thing for her to do. She decided that she did not want to live alone, and that was her choice. I feel badly for her, but that is the way some men are. My father-in-law did a form of this, and I fear for my husband starting up because it is just too easy for them to do. Talk to him about this, but do not expect the truth. Do not threaten him as he is already hiding it from U. Decide in your own mind what is important in your marriage before U confront him again, and be as nice and calm as U can be. I feel for U. Good luck.|`|lgyPxg26aa	Your husband doesn't want you to be a part of his 'porn life'.      It would be better if he could keep it to himself or quit, but apparently, that's not an option right now.    You can keep asking him about it and keep getting lied to, get both of you into counseling to deal with this, or just stop asking him about it.|`|5jMNBO2naa	the main reason he lies  is he knows sooner or later you will not be happy with his porn habit  as it will eventually gravitate to more extreme forms of it  and that you will judge him on it  as one day you will grow up and ask your self  who did i marry? and you might realize it's not what you want    \as for you being secure, that's another aspect  as you have to know he looks for the hottest women he can find in his searches, and after a while that does take a toll on your mentally
62Dk8fJDaa	Could be worse I guess... he could have cut his leg open chasing you around, till he caught you and you crapped everywhere from being scared to death of him...    me thinks a certain jayjay needs a hug!    >>|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	yes, just like when i beat up children and midgets|`|5jMNBO2naa	few men like cats  so when he is in a bad mood  he sees the cat as perfect release for his tensions  even if it means he get a little hurt doing do  as getting the cat goes along with his mission  and men are mission and task oriented|`|y9CgveCGaa	Wow, I think if I did that I would just feel injured.  And a little silly for letting a cat get the better of me.|`|ICLekd2Vaa	letting the hubby catch me and carry me off to bed does!! ;)|`|lpznO5Inaa	I feel most manly after a night of drinking beer and eating corned beef and cabbage and taking it out on the toilet while talking all kinds of trash as it suffocates...|`|LMIbr1aeaa	I like cats and dogs!  I grew up with them when I was little.|`|9IvcV7tiaa	i'd make him feel like a man by giving him a swift kick in the balls. what a jerk.
l9lBWiR1aa	Ok, well first of all just ask him why he invited everyone but you. Ask him why you arent good friends anymore, talk about old fun times with him, maybe he will get the hint after awhile. And asking him to hang out and do something you both like to do will help.|`|M8KeZ5CKaa	Talk to him.  Seriously, it will help.  Tell him how you've been feeling lately and that you seem like your losing him to new people.  It never hurts to invite yourself in sometimes, because in the end you won't regret it.      He's just getting used to the new people.  It never hurts to have more than one friend.  Just try to put yourself in the group and make friends with the other guys.  Obviously your friend sees them as friends, so you may have something in common!  Try it!      And if they don't appreciate you being there, then he wasn't a true friend in the first place.
gzoVU97Paa	unfortunately babe things happen a lot worse than that,and another unfortunate reality is that taken him to court over him hitting her with a pillow will just be a joke....i would definitely keep my eyes open though if he uses any belts,fists,or something harder than a pillow...also find out {from your friend}if her mom knows he's doing that,and if you are still concerned notify your school counselor{if you all go to the same school,its a plus}find out a few abuse hot-lines and definitely give it to her and keep one for yourself{in case things get worse}right now i wouldn't worry about it to much b/c he could have done worse like spank her,or rape her,or something horrible like that....and then maybe your friend was overreacting b/c she doesn't like him....maybe she was emotionally hurt and not physically hurt so much....hope this helps|`|csFp83i1aa	definately not right... you need to tell someone who can help and make sure her mom knows what happened. if its neccesary have her stay at your house for a little bit or someting. let her know your there|`|AA12316366	this place sounds like a lunatic asylum doesn't sound like a healthy atmosphere in be around. get some new friends. i know this may not be easy but negative crap like this will drag you down|`|t7ITkXlOaa	my parents never did that to me. that must be a pretty scary thing to happen to you. maybe you can talk to your mom/dad/adult and decide about what you should do|`|M8KeZ5CKaa	Definitely NOT normal.  Tell a trusted adult!     THIS IS ABUSE.    No one should do this to a child, ESPECIALLY not a step-parent!!!!|`|xArlqHtraa	It isn't right at all for him to hit your friend. You need to tell an adult, a teacher, a parent, anyone you can trust. You never know what might happen if one day her step-dad gets way too mad...
2uzOkFr7aa	1. Yes because it'd kind of be like you're threatening to harm her.  2. Yes because you still harmed her :P  3. You'd get in trouble for fighting period.  4. Depending on how bad it is, maybe    That's how my school worked I'm not sure if yours is the same :s|`|hKax9Jl6aa	Fighting is not always gonna solve your problems. Don't waste your time fighting in school, since it will cause a big diciplinary action such as expelling you or suspension. It's not worth it. Just report the bullie(s)to your principal or a supervisor and let them handle it.|`|2NoxxqXkaa	It all depends on the school (private or public)     Public School     1. Maybe cause she might think ur gonna hurt her  2. maybe because public school  3. yes for gangin up on her     Private    1. Yes because its mean lol  2. Yes becuase their very strict and they dont want any violence   3. yes because its 3 against 1 duh and the private schools dont like fighting   4. yes because I was even told if you do anything out of school and its bad that its like you did it in school and u still get in trouble    hope I helped :)

If you found her on a street corner then you are talking to a prostitute! LOL.     If not and yeah. If she asks for money after the sex then shes a prostitute. If she does like days after than she is just desperate for money. Be a nice boyfriend but break up with her if she asks right after the sex.|`|7df197snaa	isn't it obvious that she is just asking for money..i mean who makes love then asks for money, unless she's a gold-digger. then that's understandable.     i don't know everything about her or your relationship but it seems to me that she just wants the money. i doubt she is being sincere.     good luck :]|`|UNV987Zoaa	im sry but she i prob just saying to get money my advice is if u really like her sit her down and say hey i love u but if ur only ater me 4 $ then its not going to work (hint: she may lie)  or  u can just dump her  or  after u make love and she ask 4 money say sry i dont hav any and continue to do that 4 a couple times (u might b surprise)
epQXDf9Kaa	Sex can destroy a person s life if done outside marriage... abortions, out of wedlock babies, std s, feeling manipulated after we though someone loved us and had sex and the person won t marry you...it can cause trauma if not controlled...And condoms...are not always of any use...Sexual relations should hacve a meaning, you should do it only with someone you re sure of (for instance your husband or wife), it can cause stress...I think it shouldn t be used selfishly and with ideas of manipulation...And alsowether you love someone or attracted to them, you needn t sleep with them. It s a false idea our environment sends us.|`|wE89mPZ3aa	I do not think it is anymore.  Sex is everywhere in movies ,on tv and it is used to sell all kinds of things.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	It's not. Alot of people are very open about it.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Lol who said sex whas bad? Sex is not bad, unless you are cheating on the one you are with goin around with abuncha other girls. then it's wrong. but sex is not. sex is good! lol|`|oeEsnwSMaa	Whats wrong with You!|`|AA10248966	We are an anal retentive nation of maniacs.|`|AA11205004	Well the fat kid may be picked on while eating ice cream.

VSVQHKwKaa	Wow....    This isn't even a slice of humble pie....this is eating the whole pie tin completely clean.     Look, divorce is tantamount to cheating. You've been unfaithful to the marriage. Different actions...same severity.     And the remedy is the same too...you've got to apologize, demonstrate your re-commitment to this marriage, and let some time pass amicably.     I think your odds are pretty good. Most men don't want to be divorced and are quicker than women to bury the hatchet.    But I wouldn't get too comfortable too quickly. We're talking about 2-3 years of walking on some egg shells.    Good Luck!|`|asxqampCaa	Like you, I think J L-D is one super hot momma. geezus.|`|UeCgFgucaa	yes .. we have to think Meany time for that think|`|TfijWwsYaa	Personally, if I ever got the nerve to do this I would never look back.|`|tClYrQ1vaa	you need to prove your love tell them why you wanted a divorce and why you don't want to get one now.|`|AA11644956	My best friend divorced her husband and got remarried to him.    they were obviously living apart, and he came to pick up the kids and what not. he just wanted to work things out (what he did is a WHOLE different post). they were going to family therapy so that the kids would be okay (they weren't upset, but they wanted to cover their bases). so eventually it came around to her actually talking to him about things other than JUST the kids.    they went back to couples therapy, and eventually started dating again (or whatever you call that, lol). they got remarried, and things are good for them as of today.        so i guess that is to say you can work it out with your guy. try counseling.    but i don't think there is any magical thing you can do to get him back.    you have to look at the root of the problem (the reason why you're getting a divorce).            check out my sites:    My Fashion Site  http://www.styleandregalia.com/      My Rantings  http://unabashedly-raving-mad.blogspot.c...|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	Are you sponge worthy?

xArlqHtraa	I'm sorry, but it doesn't seem like there's anything you can personally do yourself besides keep your head high. I think that it's the other people's problem. Don't stop trying to talk with the rest of the tennis team though. After a while they might let you in. Good luck!|`|AA12316366	sorry i don't understand this unless they are prejudiced against asians or are just young and ill mannered
zaSyEcnqaa	I said yes because I knew without a doubt that he was the one i wanted to build my life with.     My fiance is reliable, honest, committed and loving and he puts our relationship first above all. He will make a wonderful husband.    I am a lucky girl .      No, I never turned down a proposal, but was engaged previously about 5 years ago and thankfully broke up 3 months before the wedding. It was a horribly wrong situation|`|gli7SbBoaa	It sounds stupid but he and I clicked.  From the moment we officially met we were joined at the hip.  I couldn't dream of saying no to him.|`|cQDEjeZ7aa	When my boyfriend asked me to marry him I said yes because I love him so much. We've been together for 3 1/2 years, and we have a beautiful 6 month old son together. I had been waiting what seemed like forever (lol) for him to actually get down on one knee and ask me to marry him. So were getting married May 2nd of this year:)|`|Bbhi7G8jaa	I havent been proposed yet but I will say yes because he is perfect for me. We want a life together and be with each other through think n thin|`|LAXbJfvwaa	I've only been asked once and I answered yes!  The reasoning has nothing to do with the proposal itself - I said yes because I knew he was the one person I wanted to and could spend the rest of my life with.  He is my best friend and I can tell him anything and we don't mind doing everything together.  Five years into it and we still don't like spending more than a day away from each other (even though we sometimes have to!)    So I obviously haven't turned down a proposal - but my Mum did before she found my Dad!  This old guy who she used to help out with chores asked her - he was her grandfather's age and wanted children..... ewwwww!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	It was the fact that I can't imagine my life without him. He is my best friend and I want to spend the rest of my life with him.     No, I have only been proposed to once and I said yes!|`|jK9H6PHiaa	i said yes because i love him and i couldn't imagine not falling asleep next to him at night. i don't care if he didn't even propose with a ring or if he stumbled over every word i was happy i get to marry the man of my dreams.|`|x5PgcqZfaa	I said yes because my wanted to have kids for the first time in my life and I wanted to have them with my husband...and I truly loved him...if it weren't for those things I would not have said yes or even talked about marriage with my hubby...|`|7CKipTZOaa	I knew he was sincere and would never hurt me on purpose.  I have said no to a proposal, we were too young and he was asking for the wrong reasons|`|Lwved4teaa	the reason anyone would say no is not because of the proposal itself its because of the person thats asking.  the man of your dreams could propose horribly and a girl would still say yes but if someone that you did not love proposed in the most romantic way they would say no.
mj3TroTLaa	Don't be so nervous. Loosen up and first hang out with that person with friends around - so it doesn't seem so nervewracking. If they like you, why not tell him your true feelings as well??|`|QI40WS98aa	Calm down. Play it cool. If he likes you enough he'll go for you. If not, he's not worth it. Let time play it's toll. @^.^@|`|r5lqi1Uxaa	Well... what's the problem?  Is he a lot older (5+ years) or a lot younger?  If not then there really isn't a problem!    PS: For future reference, we're not mind readers you have to give a little more info than that to go on.|`|30Tb3xyVaa	awwwwww     u must feel bubbly inside   lucky-ducky... -_-     im jealous     :P just be like "heyyy" don't be to   preppy like "HIIIIIIIII!!!"     haha yeah and just talk about things  YOU think hes "into".|`|0hQ8fZXqaa	Ask him out! :-) good luck!|`|DwTrJ9GTaa	well fist how old are you how old is he that will give people a clue on how to help you
HtHFHfDKaa	yes you are old enough to have a bf but I would just be careful what you say and do around your aunt and dad since they are the troublemakers for you. Your mom should understand if the guy is a friend then there isn't much to explain. I have plenty of friends who are guys. In one more year you will be old enough to be on your own with your own rules. Talk to your mom dad and aunt let them know how you feel and your aunt has no right shooting her mouth off when she doesn't even know your friends.|`|p0Y360fSaa	wow. tell the ***** to back off & stay out ya bussiness.and talk to your mom about it too,tell her its all lies.ik this isnt much, but i hope i helped a little =) best of luck with the pest,|`|mFkfJwLOaa	you should talk about it with your mom, because your deffinately old enough, and my best friend has an aunt like that and its so bad even i want to jack her in the face. maybe if you tell your mom how frustrating it is to you then she wont take what she says seriosly and talk to your dad too|`|9c9kZePHaa	I say talk to your mom about this...if you explain to her your side (gently and kindly) then she will believe you. Maybe she can talk it out with your aunt, or the three of you can talk together. I do not reccomend talking to this woman alone though, because it sounds like she would just turn it around and say you were being rude and disrespectful.     And yes, I think 17, or almost 17, is a fine age for a boyfriend. Good luck!|`|7AFLaiYjaa	your aunt shoudn't be nosying her way into our buisness. If she was my aunt id tell her to back off and live her own life.|`|0V2UrTqoaa	yea your old enough to have a BF, I think you should tell you parent/s about this how she's misinterpriting everything then talk to you "aunt" and tell her that she is misinterprting everything and she really needs to back off.    this way your parents will know about what you really told her and they'll know if she's lying to them and telling them something you didnt tell her.    hope that helps|`|iiThYzRpaa	yeah your old enough, Im telling you this in all honesty...tell her to BACK THE HELL OFF...if you intimidate her, she wont know what to do.|`|ia2kz4qyaa	if she cares about you, then she should trust you
JIVWSfZbaa	"something sweet for someone sweet"  send it to all your friends...that way he won't think its random|`|dCmSA6r2aa	this is almost as sweet as you|`|TwwMtHBxaa	do you go to dvms? cause I heard thatthey are giving those out there.
plGuYnNDaa	I think you should get away from him.. he sounds kind of controlling.. you just have to do it nicely and get it over with before you get hurt again.. if you really dont like him you cant pretend that you do because it would also hurt him more if he found out. So i think you should politely end whatever is going on between you guys.. Hope this helps you out a bit :):)|`|DwTrJ9GTaa	just left my guy in dec 20th it was hard i drug it out for 4 months i was with him for 5 years do not tell him at your house then hell never leave i did it over at my sisterand brother inlaws house i told him i wasent in love with him any more and we couldnt be togther after that i went home its still a little hard but i sure feel better|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	a restraining order.|`|OtvAUGv1aa	If he freaks out - it's his problem, not yours. Stop all communication - especially if you feel uncomfortable around him.|`|McOF0DVnaa	use your brain and think. its not that hard|`|hKax9Jl6aa	Completely not speak to them at all and find new friends
KWeU8LJtaa	Hm, tough one since she didn't get the hint. Well if it was me, I'd say something along the lines of "We're low on money and cutting the guest list even more, so I don't even know who I'm going to be able to invite anymore besides close family"  It's not lying, you had to cut the guest list    It sounds kind of mean, but I mean if you're having a small wedding and it's all you can afford..it's not like you were TRYING to be rude, she just invited herself.     Trust me, I know how you feel.. I'm having about 20 people at mine..imagine the trouble the guest list has caused!|`|xryXnje7aa	Its your big day you shouldnt stress about anyone thing but your wedding. let her no if she comes to come alone because thier wont be enough room for a lot of people cuz its very small...then if she doesnt mind going totally alone then she will or if she doesnt want to go alone she "wont be able to make it" or i fu really dont want her to show up at all call her and tell her thier is absolutly no table or food space left and tats your sorry but at least she can go to her other freiends without feeling guilty for not making it to one|`|37PpYx8oaa	I'm sorry, but at this point it would be rude to "uninvite" her.  When you discovered her mistake was the point in time to gently let her know that while you value her friendship, she is not invited.    However, by letting her continue to believe she was, you basically gave her an invitation right then.    Maybe she won't come, but if she does, please make her and her boyfriend feel like welcome guests.  It's your wedding, but you won't remember those silly details.  What you'll remember is the way your man looked at you as you walked down the aisle, and you know, other things that have to do with WEDding him.    Oh, and if she does come with her BF and the kids, just ask someone in your wedding party to make sure they behave.  After all, that's one of the reasons you have bridesmaids.  :)    Congratulations!!!|`|Mn1HTfqaaa	Distance yourself for right now, and post-wedding, invite them to a dinner in your new home to celebrate if you think she would be offended, or offer to meet her at a restaurant. Do not mention wedding details anymore, like a place, and when she doesn't get an invitation, I think she'll know. She seems selfish (and admittedly, not close) so if she gets offended, you should remind her that you told her before and that she must not have been listening.     Good luck, this is a touchy subject! Best wishes and Congrats!|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	Tell her "sweetie, I'm sorry but I'm not inviting you." If she is your best friend or your sister, she'll realize what you're saying and be fine with it. If she is only into herself, she might take offense. That's her problem.  If you are going to be a married lady and a mother, you must learn to treat juveniles as children. Otherwise you'll look around to see that everyone at your table is there because they are selfish and not because you invited them.|`|7KAduk1daa	If it's true that you never invited her, then you must tell her the truth, of course.  Learning to say no to others can one of the hardest things to do, regardless of what they are asking or assuming that we'll do for them.  Why?  Because parents scolded us for saying no and "being disrectful or disobedient" when we tried to assert ourselves as young children and therefore we never learned to find our own voice and live our own lives.  Or because society in general teaches that it is 'selfish' to do things for yourself and not include others.  Either way, it's baloney.      I strongly recommend you look into your heart and decide what's the best thing to do.  If you haven't invited her, then tell her.  On the other hand, if you are NOT holding up to your responsibilities in some way, then you must be honest with yourself.  By the way, this has nothing to do with her boyfriend.  Not trusting him is no reason to exclude her.    Go with your heart and be your own person.  This is a perfect opportunity to practice the art of saying no.|`|AA11082914	I'm with Kiwi on this one. Just play it out like you were going to invite her and tell her in a couple of days that you've had to cut the guest list even more. She won't know the difference, and you won't have to come out and say, Sorry, but you weren't invited in the first place.|`|jK9H6PHiaa	just tell her, it's going to be all family and it may be awkward for you to sit with crazy aunt bertha lol, so i think you'd fit in more at the other wedding. or tell her you understand and she can go to her other friends because you won't feel hurt, invite her to you bridal shower and tell her that's all you need to know she cares. or talk to the other friend and have her ask her to come to her wedding.
1DeQWU6Baa	Im really not sure how you can go about finding things out, other than asking other family members. Maybe try to get your birth records or see your actual birth certificate, it should have you real birth mothers name on it. Let me just say, though, that the way your "family" is treating you and the things they are saying to you are horrible and abusive. I hope you find the courage and strength and discover who you really are. Good luck, Sweetie!
tU5NJVL3aa	Just tell her straight up exactly what you just told us.  [you could even copy her this question] I know it's hard, but trust me it will get things sorted out right quick.  She will then know exactly where she stands, and how you feel, and will let you know right away (if not shortly) how she feels and what she wants to do about it.|`|oxWpo4bqaa	Send her a message and ask her to hang out.  Apologize for losing her number.  But when you two are hanging out - tell her that you shouldn't have let her get away.   Tell her you passed up something great and would like to give it another shot.|`|XkR2nRGGaa	jus act as if you didnt even stop talking to her and dats right get of your *** and talk to the girl besides you didnt ask her to go out w/ you so there were few string attached but now you have a chance tie those strings back and more if you get my drift|`|McOF0DVnaa	just tell her the truth man.  dont apologize but just say "look, i regret not askin you out before, i think me and you would be good together."  be honest|`|bf3bc2c3811507a54ef69dd9118ca5a3aa	You put the ball back in her court, by saying you really like her. Say your sorry you didn't put more effort in the relationship while you had the chance. Giver her your number and if she can find it her heart to forgive you to give you a call. If not, you understand and won't pester her anymore.

But, obviously she might not like you.  You may think that ya'll had a good relationship or whatever because you talked everyday.  Here is the facts: internet relationships don't work.  If you talk over the computer, you don't really get a chance to interact with them in person.  And that really takes away from who they really are.  If you asked her if she blocked you and she said no, then either she is lying or telling the truth.  If she is lying, then maybe you should take a hint.  She just isn't that into you.  And if she isn't, it isn't the end of the world.  She just isn't meant to be with you and vis versa.  If she isn't lying, then she probably has been swamped with homework or something and hasn't had time to chat much on the computer.  If this is true, then you should give her a break.  If you really truelly like her, then you should catch her one day after school or somewhere where you can have a little privacy and are able to chat a heart to heart.  Just tell her how you feel, and that if she doesn't feel the same way, then that is ok with you.  That you just wanted to get it out there just to see how she felt.  If she doesn't feel the same way, suggest that you still want to be friends and go on like nothing ever happened.  You will eventually get over her.  Eventually might seem long, but trust me.  It isn't if she doesn't like you.  That just means she isn't the one for you, and you will be able to get over her faster.  If she does like you, then suggest to take her to a movie or something.  Take her to a place where you can get to know the real her.  Where you get a chance to talk to her in person, not just over the internet.  It will all be ok.  Communication is key to every relationship, no matter how twisted it it!|`|iohG0qt8aa	.|`|AA11375230	get really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really drunk. then do it.|`|AZZFuLRraa	ask her out online or text. it doesnt hurt.|`|Ke7eHQTRaa	tell her online so if you get rejected then it will not be that embarassing. and just say hey chicka you like me or not cuz i think you HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|xRoDyYCWaa	Well number one, if you really like this girl, you can't make her feel smothered. You should probably find out how she feels about you first. Ask around first, because if you guys are friends, and you immediately tell her how you feel adn she doesn't feel the same way, you could ruin your friendship. Then you will feel really bad. Just start talking to her just casual then after awhile if you notice a change in her then you could gradually MAYBE say something. It just depends on how she feel first.|`|9mMQxpSCaa	Personally I think it would be so much better if you talked to her in person.  On the internet it doesn't seem like you care, but in person it would make it much better.  Try your hardest to get her alone, and tell her not to say anything until your done talking, and tell her exactly how you feel.   Tell her what you think about her, and how you feel about her and don't talk with too much "lovey doveyness" in your voice, but also not too much harshness or pushiness.    If you need more help, you can message me if you want.|`|aOcfAdevaa	Yo dawg take a deep breathe...suck it in....go up to her..and if she is with friends just ask to excuse her for a while...Then let your heart out..If she turns you down just say ''ok then, it was nice knowing you'' and walk away...don't look back...remember think positive thoughts when approaching her and you would get her|`|MgiK02Zbaa	just tell her in person. way better.

Kinda fairytale like with a horse and carriage too...|`|agTCqkLDaa	Assuming money is no object...    My dress is the SAME dress that Rachel McAdams wore in The Notbeook-same veil too.    We get married in March and the colors are light pink, white, and brown with a cherry blossom theme.  My bridesmaids are in sage green dresses which they picked out so that they're all unique.    We get married in a church at 4:30 and our reception is at 6:30 at the country club which is decorated with cherry blossoms and water vases as center pieces.  There are hanging lanters-light pink, brown, and some white ones with cherry blossoms on them.    We have a 3 tier wedding cake which is white with cherry blossoms painted on it.  The first layer is lemon chiffon buttercream; the second layer is chocolate fudge, the third tier is white chocolate raspberry and it's monogrammed (one letter on each cake).    The groom's cake is a tiramisu because the groom I have in mind doesn't like cake :)    Our first song is a Bille Holiday song and we've found the perfect imitator and the rest of the night is filled with music of Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Earl Hines, Charlie Parker, and other blues and jazz legends.      There is an open bar and people dance long into the night.    When the wedding is over, we go to our local hotel and make love-we stay there two days on the third day we leave for our honeymoon.|`|g6tku4aVaa	In hawaii with all my friends and family.

Different people have different opinions of problems and they need to learn how to cope with it and from there they grow as they learn from the experience.    When people face a real life problem, they can choose to hide or run away or face it head on and no one else can judge them cos it's the way they choose to live and they make their decision based on what they feel is best for them at that moment from their available choices.  Its those that grow from their learning experience that benefits the most. Don't you agree?    They are seeking suggestion and answers from here in a bid to widen their available options to handle what's bothering them now.    My experience of you is that the fact that you are asking this question is because you care in your own way. So why would that make you a jerk?|`|LgOOYyXIaa	i agree with you!!!  lol|`|DUOoMBqoaa	Nope. Just an adult. Or maybe we as Americans are generally spoiled and don't realize how lucky we are.

AA10065812	***You don't need to get along, just get a mediator.    First, both of you need to have high speed internet with a web cam and tablet input.  This way the child can have nightly contact with the other parent, and help with homework.    Alternating holidays, based on odd and even years  60 days during the summer    Clearly define the specific calendar days, until the child is 18.      Clearly define that barring any clear evidence of child abuse, the child will be taught to respect the authority of the court in these matters.  Teenagers tend to battle it, but they have to learn the the home is not a democracy.  You are the parent.  You are the example of showing respect for the court in honoring the court orders.  You also are teaching the child that there is importance in the involvement of both parents in the life of the child.    If he needs to be spoken to about cooperating, send me his email address.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I moved out of state, but luckily we agreed.  I gave him up to 6 weeks in the summer (but he only used 1 or 2 - his choice - not mind).  And he got my son during spring break.  Christmas was alternated each year.    And I paid for the plane tickets each time because I was the one that moved out of state.|`|AA11967247	3000 miles apart, court ordered alternating thanksgiving break, shared christmas break(alternating first/second half each parent), every spring break w/ non custodial parent and 6 weeks w/ noncustodial parent following the fist day of school years end. the receiving party picks up child and pay for transportation(airline tickets in our case). the non custodial parent is allowed to visit once a month for one week after giving a 2 week notice, but must get the child to any scheduled events during that time, have the child home by 6 pm weekdays, friday after school thru sunday evening 6 pm.(though that rarely happens). and webcam once a week at a time we agreed on and put in the order.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	There is no 'typical' order.

If you can say what state you are in I can probably find it for you.    But generally, for long distance visitation it is 6 weeks in the summer, and alternate the winter holidays.

You need to come to terms though for the sake our your child(ren). It is not resposible parenting for the kids if you guys can not at least try to get along. I am myself at my wits end trying to work with my exhusband but it is hard since he is in the army and stationed in Germany and claims to be working 12-18 hours at a time and gets only one day off during the week and has even barely enough time to spend with his new family out there. Or so he says.     We have two kids together as it is; a six year old boy and a four year old girl. Our six year old boy however has bad behaviorial problems and I am seeking help now for these issues; he has ADHD and ODD but I have just recently be told that he may have some sort of Autism. When I asked my ex if it would be okay for the kids to spend the summers with him and his family he says that he would only do this if the kids were in his custody and not mine...basically, he feels that with our son having these issues as it is, it is not a good influence for his kids out there in Germany. So visitation is out for now. Until I figure out what the heck he wants to do when it comes to spending time with his other two kids here with me. I guess I work to hard to try and get him to see the kids but I shouldn't, though.     Now, when he was here in the states and about fourteen hours from me...he and I met halfway to do the exchange of the kids. That helped out tremendously and I hope that one day that could happen again. Now, here is another idea...if your ex moved out of state and is just like an hour and a half or two away, then it probably would not hurt for him to come out to pick up the kids for his visitations and then you would have to go pick the kids up. My best friend's ex got the full custody of the kids and then my best friend got to have every other weekend with her kids. She was the one paying child support. Now also keep in mind that whoever has the physical custody or full custody does not have the power to do what he/she wants to the noncustodial parent. My best friend did not get to see her kids for over six months due to this butt head((I would say something worst but I can not here))) of an ex and now she is trying to fight for it.     Now in my situation and I am sure with any decree of resolution, you need to establish a parenting plan that suits both of your schedules. I dont know if counceling is required in your state before you get a divorce but I do believe that some require this. That is why it is best to consult a lawyer....if money is tight though, seek help thru legal aide in your area, as it is. Best of luck.

dOd7UqvGaa	first of all, Tanya G is totally wrong. Police Department does not see it that way. Any amount of alcohol is not to be in your system prior to getting behind the wheel of the car.    Second of all, please make yourself as a designated driver or hire a car service, or pay for a taxi cab. Either way, you are the hubby (as i am myself) to make sure your wife and her mother (and/or anybody else that goes with them) to get home safe and sound.

That being said, since she is an adult, and a mother,she should be responsible enough to know that she needs a designated driver. And if you have to be that, you should either find a babysitter for the kids and go with her, drive her htere and pick her up, or drop her off and have her take a cab home. But she should be able to go out and have fun. If you go with her, you might have some too.  P.S. One drink Does NOT equal drunk.|`|AA11644956	Well since it's her birthday, i would imagine it would be nice to get a limo, pile all the gals in, and have a night out on the town.      it's that simple.      funny that your wife doesn't want to spend her birthday with you in the equation though....        check out my sites:    My Fashion Site  http://www.styleandregalia.com/      My Rantings  http://unabashedly-raving-mad.blogspot.c...|`|tClYrQ1vaa	you should either ask a friend to do it or do it yourself you don't want her out driving even if she only had 2 drinks because if your at home how do you know that's how many she really had? its better to just either drop them off and pick them up or get a friend to do it|`|AA10925759	My big deal is that if she has the responsiblity of having a husband and a child what it the big flippin deal with going out and getting wasted. That could be done anytime.     My wife can do anything at anytime if she chooses. But it is couched in normal reality world.     You could make a great meal with wine, set the table and all would be safe. To go out is bull... or has somethig to do with Mom. You could be taking your wife out. So why is her Mom about?     No taxi, no car service and no nothing.|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	Why don't you volunteer to be the designated driver and wait in the car while they get smashed.|`|6hBKoN6Jaa	If you can afford it, hire a driver to drop them off and pick them up.  Better safe than sorry.|`|VcXIabEnaa	safety first|`|IbjhXpOwaa	First of all I want to commend you on being thoughtful and pretty selfless. I thought that this would be a question on letting her go out drinking at all :)   I think it's pretty old-school to think that it's okay to drink and drive. It's a generational thing I think. But you don't want to seem like you are making a big deal out of this right? You want to be like the cool hubbie who is totally cool with his wife going out for a drink. So you could say something before the big event like 'listen you two girls don't need to worry about a thing for getting to your pub crawl or whatever you have in mind - I'll drive you there and back and be your chauffeur at your very beck and call!   Think of the brownie points. If it's difficult in terms of having to bring your little daughter out in the cold to the car twice etc I would call her a cab to bring her wherever she wants to go and insist (more like a favour, a gentleman who won't take no for an answer) that you'll collect her.      Also if your suggestions go well, I would bring it up some time after the big event and explain why you did that. It's best to fully solve than to simply deter a problem. Tell her that you love her and have a thing about the drinking/driving thing. You worry and this would be a small thing she could do to help you get rid of that worry. I'm sure she would understand that and probably be quite touched by it.|`|d20mM90uaa	UNLESS, TEQUILA MAKES HER CLOTHES COME OFF, LET HER GO, AND STOP BEING MOTHER HEN  MAKE SURE THEY HAVE DD, THOUGH|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	If I were in your position, I'd hire a baby sitter rather than a car service and go out with my wife and mother in law. For one thing, I'd want to spend my wife's birthday with her and have some fun. In fact, I'd rather go out drinking with her than her mother going out with her.|`|TzeYsXKGaa	This is a tough one. It would be nice to just be able to trust them, but it's clear you can't be sure...so better safe than sorry. I would hire a car service and it can be her birthday present!|`|AA12204338	I must be old fashioned but I don't find it appropriate that women go out drinking w/out husbands.

m13CCGc1aa	I'm a little confused about why you would push something that has been off limits when you were already doing something kinky.    I'm sure she felt powerless and feels betrayed.  She was showing you a lot of trust by letting you tie her up, and you ruined what could have been a fun time by taking it that step further.    Did you apologize to her and tell her that you just got caught up in the moment?  Or did you "do the off limits thing" selfishly knowing that she would be upset by it?|`|wpi36XBAaa	Why is she so pissed off?  Let's see.  "She was fine with it until I took her in a way that has been off-limits since we've married." so you tied her up and then deliberately took her in a way you knew wasn't acceptable to her. "I wanted it, she didn't" That's rape.  Married or not you raped this woman physically and you raped her of her trust of you.   Pissed off? If it was me, you'd be dealing with the police at the very least.|`|JeAotEg8aa	        Apparently you're an idiot.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	If something is off limits YOU should have not done it!!! And you know it! You took advanage of your wife, And you know it! And you know why she is mad.  It looks like you might get kicked to the curb!!!!!!|`|kqa9VFrfaa	U raped your wife. U should be skinned alive. U R lucky U R still alive. I hope she gets rid of U. You are a monster.|`|lgyPxg26aa	You did something she didn't want to do that you knew she didn't want to do.  You betrayed her trust.  Be glad you aren't in jail.  Even though you are married, if she told you to stop and you didn't, you could still be charged with rape.    You finished over the top.  I seriously doubt she did, or she would have talked to you about it.     You've got some serious making good to do.  Better get to it.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	you didn't have a safe word, you always have a safe word. and you went somewhere you knew was off limits.|`|AA10248966	You violated her. Of course, she was wasted,m but she knew...Your marriage is absolutely dead as a dooknob unless she gets massive counseling immediately, and your stuff will be safe, but YOU WON":T HAVE ANY LOVE of any sort. You made a critical error in judgment,.
RUTQTgCyaa	Supposedly, you should be able to afford 3 times the amount of your annual income which would be $165,000. But you have to figure in personal expenses and utilities. The last thing you want to do is be house poor...meaning all the money you have is tied up in your house. The mortgage can range depending on credit score and the percentage rate you get...also whether you include homeowners insurance and property taxes in the payments. The first step you guys should take is pre-approval which will let you know the definite amount you are looking to be approved for. Also in this market now I would suggest buying straight out to building from the ground up...better deals right now. You could basically write your own price. Good Luck!|`|XTBlOf9baa	Honestly, you'd be better off buying a house than building a house. The depreciation of houses is astounding. If you build a house, then move into it, that house immediately drops significantly in value. Same as when you buy a car, drive it off the lot, it also significantly drops in value. That's basically a waste of an investment there with your money in my opinion. You're better off buying a house, especially with today's housing market. Prices on houses are dropping drastically, so you're better off spending your 200K on buying a house, than building a 200K house which will probably not have as many features and will depreciate in value greatly. Regardless, in general, to get a home loan, the aim is to have a 20% down payment (to get the best interest rates). You don't have that yet (it would be 40K for a 200K house). Additionally, the rule of thumb, is that, in the general area, you can afford a house, MAX, 3 times your annual income. That would be about 165K for you guys. And that's MAX. So you've already gone way over the maximum general budget there. As for monthly payments, we absolutely cannot answer that. That depends a lot of the interest rate the two of you are able to qualify for with your credit scores. Additionally, keep in mind, whenever you are constructing something, the budget always gets busted. Things constantly come up that you didn't consider, things break, things go wrong, etc. It cannot be prevented. So that's another thing to consider. Consider re-evaluating your budget, and definitely buy a pre-built home.|`|S318F1ocaa	You need to find your debt to income ratio and then compare it to the monthly payments plus interest and property tax of your possible home.    You could make 200,000 a minute and still not be able to afford a home if you are in greater debt than your net worth or your annual income.|`|AA11319441	Reported.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	Sweetie, you have to ask the bank ..no one here can tell you.    You need to apply for a loan.    You could look up your financial institution's website, and see if they have a home loan calculator ....but your best bet is to make a appointment at the bank and have a chat about your situation.    UPDATE:    I have to respectfully disagree with honeybee........Houses don't immediately depreciate the way cars do .......in fact with time most houses go up in value......but of course it depends on the real estate market at the time.|`|rx20pKgOaa	In today's market lenders are looking at 20% down which would be $40,000 on a $200,000 house.  With $30k down you would have to pay PMI, (Payment Mortgage Insurance) which adds to your payment and usually lasts about 10 years or until you have lowered the mortgage to below 80% of the loan.     So, figuring on $170k x 3 = $520k / 360 = a monthly payment of about $1400 plus the PMI of about $150 a month.    And that is only principle and interest, you still have taxes and insurance on top of that.    What you can afford will depend on your debt to income ratio which should not exceed 36% give or take.    For your first house most would recommend buying.  You should have guarantees that will cover and protect you from hazards and the landscaping will all be in.    My husband and I built our home and I love it but we ran out of funds and now, 2 years later, we are still trying to just get the grass in! :)    What ever you decide to do investing in a home is one of the best investments you can make.  Good luck to you!|`|bkDaHLNMaa	ummmmmmmmm ii really think , well you and your hubby , are you two going to have a family soon or if do alrady then depends really    just dont go over bored where you can not offoerd it     other then that  go for what your heart goes for|`|vyNlyfczaa	hmm try post your question in real estate - there you going to find the most accurate answers.  This what I can tell you - it all depends of your credit and where you live (what state and city).  Build or buy - it all depends what you are looking for, what kind of house and how fast you looking for to move in. You can also buy a 'crappy' house and remodel it completely....  About monthly payments - it all depends for how many years you are going to take the mortgage.....  Try ask the question in Real Estate section you may get more accurate :D

And maybe organize carts too...|`|LYeDd9Y0aa	sarcasticly: to make you feel welcome wen u come in!|`|AA11815233	It is not a useless job! It has several reasons. One, it presents the image of the store as a helpful, friendly place that people will like to shop at. Two, the greeters notify security if they see a suspicious-looking person enter the store. Three, the greeters can check receipts and packages and any merchandise leaving the store. A shopper cannot just pick up a TV and walk out the store with it. Four, the job provides employment to retired people. Is that enough reasons?|`|vHB9zUcCaa	my good friend's a greeter, & her job is 2 greet ppl, mark returns, & check receipts if alarm goes off.

Have you needed to go to bathroom but can't leave the door? Have you been glared at for saying hello, errr, that is "welcome to Walmart". Most of these people are not able to do the other physical labor that employees do, and if they are the right age and are qualified, they are door greeters. Most can't get a job anywhere else at their age.    Some of the job is security, and several doorgreeters have been injured by theives trying to get out the door. If they get sick, something lots of old people do, they are quickly booted out one way another by the company, losing the time they had invested.

3ae438759d1f82f0733d2a5dc01aba4daa	honestly , I think your father loves you and your sibling all equally.   maybe he just shows it more to your siblings, that's only because they are good in sports.  & no its IS NOT PATHETIC to try to impress your dad with good grades!  dont feel down, im sure your dad loves you.
f0wPMwD6aa	You quit flirting with him and walk away, recognizing that this is a guy who is otherwise occupied, and who you would be a fool to want even if he were available (do you really want to date someone who flirts with other girls whenever you're not around?). Do the same with boyfriend  1, the guy who actually still kind of expects you to be waiting for him when he decides he's finished with his current girlfriend. Do you see the beginnings of a pattern here? Anyone can wind up with a jerk once (as you did with guy  1), but you kept going back to him and now ... surprise, surprise ... you've met a guy  2 who sounds a lot like guy  1 as far as being a jerk goes. Nobody deserves to be treated like this, and I am not suggesting that is it your "fault", but at a certain point you have to open your eyes, recognize when you are getting into the same lousy situation again, and RUN (don't walk) the other way. After a few more near-misses (hopefully not too many more), you will discover that you can spot this type a mile off AND are no longer inexplicably drawn into their orbit to become their doormat. When you learn to avoid this type of loser altogether, you will attract a different and better kind of guy.|`|TgDHFMOgaa	i say you forget about the first guy...by him not breaking up with her even tho he likes sumone else says that he might be picking her over you.  The guy at your church i think you should wait for....or get to know him better to see if you really like him enough.  I wouldnt tell this guy that you like him because that cud cause problems with his relationship and then if he really likes his gf then he will prolly get all depressed and stressed.  then you wud have to pick up his pieces and hear him talking about how he liked her soooo much.  I wud just let the realationship blow out to get my turn.  But let him make the first move.|`|X7G1kjMfaa	what goes around comes around....so leave them alone and look for someones who is not commited    remember there are many fish in the sea...hahaha  gudlck
AUWfdmxQaa	It's good for kids to see their parents express affection for each other. It sets an example of a healthy loving relationship between adults.|`|TOnq6w6Baa	Yes it develops good healthy children on relationships, as long as its not groping and sexual|`|d20mM90uaa	yes, girl, it is ok i would rather my child see love than hate any day|`|uurgL3oZaa	Come on, you wouldn't actually want your kids to see what a happy, functional, loving relationship looks like, would you?     Keep that stuff a secret and encourage them to emulate what they see on TV!|`|aOinzEvYaa	Completely fine...just think in old frontier america, if a family lived in a log cabin it was basically had no bedrooms|`|rcut6bhoaa	Yes, letting your kids see that much affection between the two of you is fine.  No more than that though.|`|njhKtCTKaa	i think its great to a point, i know when i was a kid and things were good with my parents i could tell, makes you feel all warm inside, their divorced now unfortunatly lol, but when it was good it was good.  I felt secure when they kissed or cuddled.  Nothing wrong with it.  :)|`|XdeNfMARaa	Its totally fine to hug and a good bye or hello peck but tht is it! its annoying and embarrassing and some kids dont kno how to deal wth anything more than tht stuff. when its in front of them or their friends|`|rx0ekB9Paa	i think its very good. they will hear u fight so why not let them see you be happy. i dont think u need to full on make out,but my stepdad smacks my mom on the butt,or they stop to hub for a minute,or kisses all thru out the day. its adorable.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	The precondition is: only if both adults are kids legal parents and only if both adults are fully clothed.    Then, YES.  Please show kids that expressing love and affection is a very normal human behavior.  And while you are at it, hug and kiss the kids too.|`|FKN9kBvLaa	Honestly, yes.  In fact, I think its a GREAT thing.  Obviously with limits.  Nothing wrong with a couple of pecks and hugs, as long as they aren't making out.  I think it lets the kids know that they have a loving relationship and that that kind of happiness can be possible in their own adult lives.  Believe me, kids REMEMBER whether or not there was real love between their parents growing up.|`|AA11016526	I agree, I think to a certain degree it is ok to show how much you love one another just as long you show the kids love to make it point to hug them also|`|tClYrQ1vaa	its fine to huge and kiss but don't take it to the next level its good for your children to see how much you love each other rather than fighting.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Yes. Even though they gag and giggle and rush screaming from the room in mock terror....it reassures them that mommy and daddy are on good terms.    But even better than that is intimate physical contact (non-sexual).    Holding hands. Massaging necks. Scratching backs. Dancing (clean...not modern). Feeding each other. Cuddling on the couch. Teasing each other. Laughing together.    These things send an even clearer signal without adding the sexual aspect to it.     But a little kissing and LOTS of hugging are okay.     When you start making out in front of them...then you've got a problem. =)    Good Luck!|`|iZDsMCghaa	I think its for the best. It teaches the kids affection, lets them feel secure and shows them what the should expect with their own future marriages. I mean, keep it PG rated, lol but Absolutely show the affection!|`|Bc4udMhUaa	Yes, I think it's good for children to know their parents love each other.|`|WVcUweTEaa	Yes it is, it's healthy and natural and it shows the children everything is ok between mom and dad = security in the family.|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	Yes as long as there is no behind grabbing or crotch grabbing.|`|ITfBQzg6aa	Yes so when ur kids grow up and are married they would know how to show affection to there spouse.|`|2amY3xZpaa	Of course if your married. Kissing and hugging is a way to show your affection towards your spouse. Kids understand and I'm pretty sure they enjoy seeing their parents happily married and not argue or fight.|`|gfHutvEFaa	Yes!! A thousand times YES!|`|SyPQiPldaa	It is perfectly allright to express love in front of kids, but you've to set limits. Otherwise kids get too curious & try it on their own.
AA11811740	I love my bff to death, she's just like a sister lol but that doesn't make them perfect! i think the big thing I find annoying about her is that she blabbers too much...like if you don't even try to interrupt her, she'll probably talk about w/e crap she's talking about forever and ever without even giving you a chance to talk. I think it's getting better but I always have to make some effort to get in my side of the conversation. Good question btw, glad you asked!|`|Uv3h61t9aa	OMG! I love my friend but sometimes she can act so weird! Like for instance on the public buses and stuff she would like put on a fake accent,talk extremely loud, sing random songs and make really strange noises and she will also bring like weirdly shaped calculators and erasers to school which drives me crazy! My other friend too is kind of the opposite, but she is extremely serious and whenever I try to say something funny she goes like," How is that funny?" in such a rude tone and she kind of does not have a sense of humor and she told my other friend that I was not funny. She sometimes shows off and lies about her grades saying she got a 98 in math when really she got a 89. She also keeps saying things like, "You need Make-up" and "That guys staring at me" and "Everyone says I should be a model because I am so skinny." She is nice and a good friend but those qualities annoy me like hell.LIKE WTH?    Sorry for the length of this!|`|8uNLDeLQaa	if i say i am good at cooking she will say that she is the best cook. omg i get so sick at it we fight so much over it and she thinks she does nothing wrong|`|Do6NfeACaa	I love my bff, but she can be very judgmental and hypocritical.|`|6p50zivoaa	well i love my bff and its alomost like we were born sisters but she is extrmely selfish.i hate ppl like that.and she always wants here way and tries to get it in a inmature way.
ccZuEOEfaa	Next time she says she's useless and boring, say that it's absolutely not true and that you think she's really interesting and great to hang out with, and that you love to spend time with her.  If she says she hates herself, tell her that she is brilliant and maybe even say that you wish you were more like her.  As for her parents, even though she might not appreciate it, maybe you should actually talk to them, and explain to them that you're really concerned for her because she's been feeling so bad, and ask if they could do anything to help.  Finally, you should try to convince her to speak to a counsellor - is there one at school that she can go to see? They might be able to help her or talk with her parents and help to get her out of the negative rut that she's stuck in.  Good luck - I hope she feels better, and I think you're a really great friend to care so much.  ??|`|l9lBWiR1aa	Alright well first off, you needa to tell her she isnt these things. If she is pretty, and even if shes not you need to tell her she is a a gorgeous girl and shes not boring. After she studies, she needs to ask her parents to hang out with friends and stuff. Isn't there things to do around where you live? The movies and beach (if possible) on weekends and stuff. Find her a boyfriend...and maybe tell her to have a talk with her parents and tell them to loosen up on the studies.
hKax9Jl6aa	Ask her why she was upset. It could've been something else other than you. Don't take it personal until you find out the real truth from her.|`|plGuYnNDaa	You shoudl talk to her and find out why. Maybe shes was mad for some reason..|`|AmPi1Khvaa	Talk to her. She might've been mad and instead of just telling you, she's ignoring you. Don't dump her as a friend. That would be stupid|`|swJuTXcSaa	She is no friend of mine.
eb357a6f421c3b0a8108b02051b9950daa	well...  usally when one person is  going to college  and the other in high school it doest really last that long that I know have..  well  you can try  to still have the realtionship but know  people  do change. just dont try to change things  let nature  takes  it corse|`|X4U36dHzaa	turn him to a tool so he doesn't graduate!then do him so he won't want to leave!|`|NEbt7r1Saa	let him be him....|`|MgiK02Zbaa	still see him? hes just graduating.|`|RYDwwTITaa	Confess... you have absolutely nothing to lose. If it doesn't work out, you'll never see this person again anyways. But if it does work out, you only have everything to gain. =] good luck|`|CNSGz12zaa	Tell him you love him and have had a crush on him forever and dream that you will together forever and ever and see what he says.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Get her/his number|`|4JFjxElyaa	do him|`|2imXzBHbaa	you could go to Taco Bell and get a new Enchilada platter|`|hnEYB04Paa	I agree with the other guy.

Your life hasn't even begun. So what you should do is live your life and enjoy living it with or without him.|`|hceSZoAkaa	um  let him graduate?|`|uWmCQN1Iaa	give him space and support him|`|611e46e0e7c3eb9e2c5c9a52d2766b0eaa	damnn girl u need 2 chill you got a while!|`|uqCc9pJyaa	show him the time of his life ^_-|`|sROU8U32aa	does he love you back? are you two going out? you need to give us more information. what do you WANT to do? what do you think you SHOULD do? what grade r u in? is he moving away and will u ever see him again? if you will, still remain in a relashionship with him and stay close whenever you can. if hes going away "for good" then tell him how you feel and maybe he'll change his mind about leaving?
DwTrJ9GTaa	when your on line your not really putting your self out there so no worries but face to face thats had  say  hi look at them is there something hes doing or wearing that can give you a opening like  he has a skateboard you can ask him how long hes been skating show you how to skate that well give you more time with he|`|E2ludi7xaa	I no how you feel it will take u a little while to get used to talking to guys but soon it will be easy.... for now just be yourself  GOOD LUCK |`|zyTvtgS2aa	go with the flow. act normal. thats really all  you can do.
HmEZWD4faa	Taking is slowly is not New Yorker Style! No way! You must ask him out, and let the fun begin! Friends are for n00bs!|`|dCmSA6r2aa	sounds like you are already letting him be more|`|AwXQ4q6taa	It depends. If you want to risk your friendship and if he likes you like that I say go for it girl =)  but if you're like me and want to be guaranteed his best friend forever instead I wouldn't. But that gets messy if you fall in love with him instead, like me =/  But as I said if you're fine losing him as a friend for something more then do it =)  Just make sure he likes you back if you're going to make the first move because if you don't it could really mess up your friendship|`|UVeT0nmTaa	i say take it slow. if he likes you and you like him things will happen as they should :-)|`|3ijLQe5laa	let the guys make the first move!!!!
adRhKB05aa	Pray and do some soul searching.|`|41937SzNaa	Make friends... And your family you should tell some one...ANYONE that he is hitting for you... For volleyball you should practice and step up as a leader for the team so they can win more games and practice harder...Screw your friends cuz they are jerks...And im sorry about this this probably sucks
pT2gciq2aa	crazy ***** , never heard of such a person. I'm sure its awesome tho...      PS  you MIGHT want to get a new user account...crazy thought.|`|AA12316366	i think you need to get a new circle of friends. did you ever think that these  antics may fascinate you and that is why you hang out with her|`|vwoqIUR6aa	ask her why she is the way she is. ask her if she sees this stuff as normal|`|2r7PmKNfaa	Have you seen her do theese lies?  I thought not.    She is lying for attention.    That was pretty easy huh?|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Wow... becareful of her.. longs she nice and treat you good dont see no issue
s0ENa2Pvaa	Well that kind of shows you if they really are your best friends.  I've had many of these situations happen to me, but if they were true best friends they would have confronted you, and trusted your decisions.      They should trust you if they are your best friend, I'd just say leave the a message in their locker, or message them on msn, write an email explaining to them about the incident.  If it doesn't work, than at least you tried, and I guess find new friends?|`|PiaT5wIPaa	you need to tell your friends wat really happened and if they dont believe you then u have to pray about it.
QZ2XeGtwaa	I have a bunch of birthday gift ideas at my blog:  http://maryannsbirthdaygiftideas.blogspo...
KaF0nNFmaa	You already told her how you feel and she chose to not act on that and look elsewhere.  Get over it.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	tell her you don't like the way guys treat her. also tell her after all this time of being around her you have developed feelings for her. tell her you find her very sexy and attractive. and if your not into me I am sorry to lay that on you.I would just love the chance to date you. if she says I am sorry but your not someone I want to date. or I don't want it to ruin our friendship. then you need to start staying away from her because it will be very hard to go on like you are feeling.I wish you luck. I am willing to bet she is not into you. if she was she would have lead you on by now I would think. so be prepared.|`|AA11319441	Your in the friend zone, buddy.  And once your there, your there for life.  Sorry.|`|7fAHPUkkaa	ignore her, women are nuts! if she thinks you dont want her she will try everything to get with you|`|o2GmpkvRaa	Be the one to treat her like a queen she deserve to be treated. That should give her a different opinion about you and see you in different light.|`|bcfc4a553a788c7a7c8b0ab6973ab6c7aa	You will find a girl that likes you and you will like her just as much. give it time. If you keep looking her way you might miss the one and only. If she desn't have the same feelings for you then you really need to move on it is only hurting and could ruin your friendship. Good luck.|`|8OSdPa5iaa	tell her that you would treat her right unlike the other relationships that didn't go so well. if that doesn't work, then you aren't meant for each other...  sorry to say it.|`|vyNlyfczaa	maybe she though that you were just playing around and joking....maybe you can try to invite her for dinner and then tell her again:D  good luck|`|fJAijBHhaa	Be honest with her.  If she just wants to be friends and you don't maybe you should tell her that you don't want to be in contact with her for awhile so you can get over her.  That's the only way to do it.  Good luck!!|`|bkDaHLNMaa	kk grab her bye the arms and LOOK DEEP INTO HER EYES and tell her   *k half the guyz that youv bin with dont treat you right, (add somthing really touching 4rm ur heart) ii know im a friend but give me a chanse ...ii love you*     Just look DEEP n her eyes man
bogfZ6Xsaa	A rental cottage in Scotland, it's my dream honeymoon! Pick a city near Edinburgh! It's the best shopping town in Scotland plus it's gorgeously green and cozy......not to mention the sexy accents! lol  Hope this helps!|`|rzPIO1aQaa	obviously Hawaii is like the bomb (never been but seems beautiful). Costa Rica will have better weather and more time to enjoy the outdoors. The other ones are great as well. I sat Costa Rica or Paris.|`|AwYt5fd6aa	What time of year are you going?  Rome is very romantic and as long as you go in early spring or early autumn (like beginning of April or beginning of September/end of October, the weather will be warm but not stifling, and the crowds will be less. Plus since it's the "shoulder" season, you could get better rates for your accommodations.  If you give a little more info on the time of year, I'll edit this answer.
7bfc5c5422911f6b2013a81fbfd98330aa	Rome.   London ist just as expensive as Hawaii, believe me, i have been to both several times and I personally hate the food there, if you want very good food, you have to pay even more.  Paris is overrated. I like it, don't get me wrong, but the hype about Paris is just not justified.  Rome is Bella Italia, i just love Italy, it's food and culture. You should get a car and drive outside of the city, this is the real Italy. The People and Culture you will experience will be unforgettable for the rest of your life.|`|jK9H6PHiaa	i chose rome. just because i love it's history.    best of luck.|`|yxoXTmlqaa	Grand Canyon?  It's honestly beautiful and a hooneymooners spot.   You can see all the stars and the canyon is spectacular.   Just don't fall in.|`|PBdPD748aa	Australia!!!!     =]    Ask me anything if you would like to know why|`|gHR1cFsiaa	Hawaii is so nice...money shouldn't matter. It's the beginning of your life together and you should spend it however you like.|`|7CKipTZOaa	London Paris and Rome, it might be cold but you can warm each other up at night hehe|`|8phHXAO7aa	Thailand! I just went there on holiday and it was sooo Beautiful.  And nice and warm :)|`|hkQSqPEwaa	Hong kong|`|KTj9g2mGaa	London Paris Rome.  It will be so beautiful there! and just wear a jacket!|`|qq9jEPAaaa	definitely opt for the european honeymoon. yes, it might get damp...but the sights, smells, the atmosphere---cold or not, you'll love it and treasure it for years!     It's also a good thing for you both because you'll be out of your comfort zone and your bond will be stronger because you are both doing something unfamiliar.|`|2rTo7Xkhaa	go to FIJI I HEARD IT'S AMAZING AND ITS the place I REAlly want to go to|`|2bkS1VIIaa	i say you should go to japan|`|x5PgcqZfaa	I say a beach near your home with possible...and don't plan to do too much...my husband and I had a wonderful honeymoon just having a great time not having anything planned...that made it feel like a real vacation and gave us plenty of "hotel time"...congrats!|`|EQydFhzmaa	I would go to London, Paris, and/ or Rome. Personally, I would stay away from some tourist-packed areas and go to some more rural places. For example, lets take Italy. Instead of going to Rome, I would find another quaint, romantic city and take a tour of a winery. Which ever you choose, I'm sure it will be fantastic.|`|V4rc9ijEaa	London, Paris and Rome that way you guys can have an excuse to cuddle while you take a walk becasue of the cold. cute and congrats|`|ystl4DhTaa	Costa Rica is great...anytime of year.  Dominican Republic is nice too.|`|WchGezIAaa	Mauritius.   its beautiful there. and way better then Hawaii.|`|xArlqHtraa	Paris! The city of love! Plus, the cold won't matter so much, it just gives you an excuse to cuddle up with your sweetie. Congratulations about the honeymoon!
fJ7E43kWaa	...Always look on the briiiiight siiiiide of life.
62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	ask him if he wants to be in a committed engagement with the intent to marry you after his first tour  if he says yes you are engaged and you both should expect the other to be faithful. If not walk|`|Zf18VjlCaa	He's still quite young to be jumping into a marriage. He can't be any older than 21 (?). Most men aren't ready for marriage then and when you see these young kids getting married in the military, those marriages usually fail. Many military marriages fail because of the amounts of stress that's on the relationship. There's a lot of cheating spouses in the military too. You need to calm down a little. He's obviously not ready to get married and pushing him to do so isn't going to get you the results you want. You need to let him settle in to life...|`|rceK0oglaa	i think you doing the right thing by staying cause if hes going to be gone it gives you a lot of responsibility and a lot when that happens most people cant handle it all by themselves.|`|IIoouep5aa	he didnt want to marry u before he left and u shouldnt have given him an ultimatum.its makes guys feel pressured and so then they refuse. just stay but tell him how u feel|`|EQydFhzmaa	I would have left him. You both are so young. Many people returning from war have different medical issues that ruin relationships and families. I think you are making a huge mistake to stay with him. He will probably be a burden on your life and your heart. Again, I would get closure and move on.
76nTvO4iaa	And what exactly has to be put on an invitation?    1.  Who's getting married.  2.  Where they're getting married (Name of Venue and Address)  3.  When they're getting married (Date and time)  4.  Request for an RSVP, if you want to know how many people are coming.|`|LCAzlHhEaa	I would go to Michael's or any office supply store and get pre-sized invited.  If I was doing this I would get one's that maybe a small graphic close to the top. This is a style I would consider http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/p...   Then to incorporate army if you are doing green for your colors I would find a pretty green ribbon & punch holes in the invites and then tie the ribbons into the invites.  With this style of invites I would put the ribbon inside the edges of the box that is pre-printed on the invite    When I did the holes for my invitations I picked a very pale gray color and placed 2 circles to print out with the text of the invites that way every invites ribbon would be placed in the exact same spot.  The circles were where I punched the holes.  You will want a pretty small hole punch so that the holes are not terribly noticeable.  Also, to keep the edges of the ribbon from fraying you can gently melt where you cut the ribbon with a lighter.    Hope this helps!  Have a great wedding|`|x5PgcqZfaa	I would go to office depot or staples and see what they have...my to put on an army flair I would look up invitation shops by your house or online.     Generally on an invite if your parents are paying for the wedding you put their names.  But you put the date, location, and anything you really want.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Check out michael's or staples (not as many as Michael's but a few) or check out www.theknot.com they have crap loads of ideas on there.(with pictures. lol)  There are tons of ways to word invites as well so I'd just  I'd just google and look around a bit. see what you prefer. and what suits the formality of your wedding etc etc.  Good Luck!|`|AcBbB39aaa	You can order custom wedding invitations from http://www.bjoyfulinvitations.com and there are some great invitations here:    http://www.einvite.com/?Cobrand=8KF0IK&S...  http://bjoyfulinvitations.cceasy.com/  http://bjoyfulinvitations.mcphersonsprin...
naijqNojaa	if you are going to make a relation with her, i will say you should always be honest to her. tell her what you want|`|lgyPxg26aa	Ditto what Jenna said.|`|vwcDdNfcaa	yes, honestly i think people are "fake" over the e-net  they may not act like them and try to be someone they   are not face to face was so much better once dating   (if you get there) tell her you just made it then give it  to her but when learning about someone face to face  is an amazing idea. when in CLASS not e-mail ask   her if she can explain something to you or if you can  buy her lunch and copy her notes because you were  day dreaming. she likes you if she ask so thats a good  start remember you need to work your way up so one   step at a time. best of luck.|`|AZZFuLRraa	call her and ask her on a date|`|jAGwyyuyaa	Yes, good idea. And tell her what you want to do. She may be willing. I think face to face is the best way.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	ask her out|`|ljwJr6u8aa	your not starting out truthful. if you like her just tell hey I have an msn account. heres my name. or whatever. tell her you don't like the idea of chatting to much.
v0Cv36cNaa	when I was a kid it was father son.  But then again he wasn't around for a lot of that.  In today's modern era it could be both.    Did I mention Mildred is my leader?|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I would say its a father/son thing because of male bonding.|`|WewCtMpzaa	Cub Scouts can be the whole family. In fact I had a den mother one year. Boy Scouts is teenagers and their fathers, and the boy scouts are more rugged not to mention more extreme camping trips. The dividing line is the arrow of light.|`|S318F1ocaa	I was an atheist cub scout member when I was in grade school...they just ever told me about the meetings and neither of my parents were involved so....i think it's a christian parent son thing.|`|fmHHcFd5aa	honestly its all jacked up these days. girls are joining boy scouts and they cant do jamborees or go into the woods and do boy stuff. it was meant to be a boy thing and a father son thing and now all the den mothers are taking over ruining it. you dont see boys in girl scouts or dads being leaders cuz then it would be a situation that they are rapists and pedophiles yet woman can do it? i hate it. My brothers in it and its turned these kids all fruity ever since the woman took over. boy scouts is a man thing thats what girl scouts is for.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	it's more about who has more time. then again the husband or wife should be supportive of the other. and help when they can.|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	i would say it is a family thing,   i used to take my son because dad worked the hours that the meeting were   there was some things that dad was there for though|`|jChr0udLaa	Either parent can be involved or even both of you. In our family my step son goes to most meetings with mom unless it is a week end activity then we go and we go to the pinewood derby and the regatta race.|`|Z7KRAzbeaa	I have many years of scouting experience.  In general cub scouts is a family/son thing.  Family is encouraged to help with fundraisers, campouts, community service etc..  It's really great when a family member comes to the den meeting and participates in any way that the den leader would like.  Sometimes it's the dad that helps, the mom, take turns, an older brother or sister.  Some parents just drop their child off and all the other adults look out for that kid.  Boy Scouts is for family too, and mothers are involved, but my experience is that mothers bow out at this point and the fathers take over.  Mothers go to some meetings, some campouts, but it can be pretty tough and mothers honestly don't like all the hardships of camping like most guys and scouts do.  Mothers are essential for troop support though and the involvement promotes the troop.  This is all voluntary...and doing your part...whatever you can do is really helpful.  Perhaps you only help at one function, but something is better than nothing.    In my family we took turns with cubscout  den meetings.  Both of us went to pack meetings. (for awards and such).  With boy scouts my husband did much more than me.  I bailed out after one campout where you couldn't shower for one week, unless you jumped in freezing lake water.  that was enough for me.      this program was great for my family, and fantastic for my kids.|`|DekGIOImaa	I think it is more based on who has more time to be involved. I was a den mother for my son for 1 year only because my husband had to work on the days that they had the meetings and activities. I went camping with the scouts 1 time and my husband went the other 2 times.  It is just a matter of who is more available. It can go both ways.|`|Xkzsk2Wgaa	Cub scouts is more a family/son thing.  Mothers are often involved in all aspects.    Boy Scouts is a father/son thing.  It is more a rite of passage, male bonding, fire, knives, and camping. Fun for father and son.    I always recommend that you don't start your son to early in scouts.  A lot of cub scouts get burned out before they get to Boy Scout, where the real fun is.
bM4zYt44aa	I don't mean to burst your bubble or break your heart but you'r 13.  You shouldn't even be worried about dating yet, at least not that special one.

He might not take it the right way- he could think you have the warmies for him, or that you are making fun of him.    Maybe to emphasize that it's just a joke, get another gag gift like diapers or one of the funny ones they sell at different places.    Hope this helped!  -El|`|b9d09d935292dcc7a4c8127386489dc8aa	hahaha yeh! if he has a sense of humor nd isnt gonna be like wow a leapord thong some friend i think its hilarious and maybe a back up gift just in case lol but i love the idea! and ya noe maybe u can thumbtack it to his door or something....
jgimpZSpaa	people like to flirt with the possibility of divorce these days  and in reality...it shouldnt be an option  especially with a baby girl  even though the media has corrupted the "family system" and told everyone its okay to have multiple spouses...its not ...right..i guess  having a baby together is beautiful  its amazing  that little ball of life, full of wonder and amazement, and possibilities,  God is so creative, he created us..and he gave us the awesome power of creating and u and your husband....u created a child, its so beautiful...  and you must become selfless   since u chose to have a baby..u chose the selfless route even if u were ready for it or not  and ur husband is in this with u a hundred percent and if u chose to mess with it...change things by divorcing...u can ultimately impact your childs life in a horrible way  stay together  not just for the child...for u guys  seperating would complicate everything  your bored  you both need to take a step back  look at life....its amazing  and this is kind of harsh..but remember its not about you  out of all the other problems people are facing in the world....poverty, starvation, death....  you guys should look at it like this, if u spent less time arguing, and took the time to focus your attention on helping others...you would feel way more complete in your relationship...and would stop worrying about your small-scale problem  stay together  he loves you  and you love him  go and kiss him! and hug him! and tell him that everything is going to be all right because you guys ARE going to make it work and divorce is not an option.  start over  become like flirty teenagers  have fun! life is short! you found your "one", be thankful!!!!   GodBless|`|RjpPzbBJaa	You should never, in my opinion, suck it up for a child. That's not going to help the kid in any way...to have to unhappy parents who are stuck in a loveless or disrespectful marriage.  If counceling hasn't worked, you need to consider..was it the councelor (they aren't all perfect) or was it one of you who didn't put in the effort.  Since you have kids, and you seem to love him..he seems to be a good guy just has some issues, I strongly recommend you find another councelor willing to do what it takes to help you guys. You both need to get some things out in the open and solved, otherwise the marriage will be doomed for sure.|`|WewCtMpzaa	Yall sound like a married couple. If you can't love them one minutes, and ready to kill them the next, you are not doing something right. The grass is never greener on the other side.     With the shift in spirits, have you checked to see if you and/or he is bi-ploar.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	sounds like you need counseling. you can't live your life for her. nor can you expect her to stay with a man some day because you like him.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	There are so many different types of counselors out there. Don't give up, find another person who can help U. Nothing is perfect. U R describing a lot of marriages when U write your question. Focus on the good things while U R working out the details. Ask what are your long term goals and dreams. When I want to run away I focus on these dreams, and then I see our marriage in a bigger picture and purpose.|`|msKHbeCzaa	The main thing you have to ask yourself is, Do I spend more time unhappy than I do happy? Are you usually miserable and every once in a while feel happy? If your husband is a great father, and good husband,but he just has his issues, hell we all do. A lot of people don't like counseling, but trust me, IT WORKS. Have you been telling him how you feel about everything? If you haven't been, you need to. How can someone change if they don't know everything that bothers you and know how you feel. I think that since you both have a child together, it is vitally important to do everything you both can to solve your problems and try to make it work before you think about divorce. Too many people divorce because they think it'll be too much work to try, but marriage is not easy, and sometimes it takes years to set things the right way. Me and my husband got married 9 years ago because I got pregnant with our daughter. He had issues that just plain disgusted me. He wasn't abusive either, but definitely had his problems that made me think I should leave him many many times, but I didn't. Instead I convinced him to go with me to talk to our pastor at church. He didn't want to go at first, but once we did, he realized it helped him too, because there were things about me that bothered him as well. For the first 2 years of our marriage we fought A LOT. But after we worked through our issues, everything fell into place. We worked really hard on our marriage, and it was well worth all of it. We are now happier than I could have ever imagined, and barely fight ever. All I'm saying is fight for your marriage. If it doesn't work out in the end, don't you want to know that at least you did everything you both could to at least try to make it work? I think that's not only what is fair for both of you, but what is fair for the child you both have together. Good luck sweetie!|`|dQrBlk4qaa	You don't need couple's counseling. He needs to attend some therapy himself to help him control his anger and/or irrational outbursts.     The best you can try to do is to talk to a psychiatrist who works with this type of therapy, and talk to them, to see if a meeting can be arranged. This will not only benefit your relationship, but his stability, well being and general happiness.|`|Bl9u2e73aa	don't divorse. talk to him without fighting maybe see a counceler.  but its brutal on the kids so don't|`|B0XamShQaa	if 1 part of you wants a divorce... then you REALLY want a divorce deep down.  It's like going healthy... you look at a burger and think "I shouldn't eat it" but deep down you really want it.    Anyways, research the effects divorce has a children and families and make your decision.    This might cause emotional distress to you too.|`|ZIUK6UzRaa	I am a child of divorce myself, and i personally feel that i am glad my parents got divorced. They dont love each other, and my father has remarried and is totally in love with my stepmother. I am very happy for him. If you aren't happy in this relationship, then end it. It isnt right for you to suffer through a relationship you dont want, under any circumstances. I know that it will be hard to do, but do what you need to for yourself. Your daughter should understand, especially since she is so young.|`|a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	i don't know what you should do.  but i do know that you shouldn't stay together just for the kids.  you will end up resenting and eventually hating each other, and they will pick up on that.  i know everyone says divorce messes kids up, and it does.  but if you have a better chance of getting along when you are not together, and it will be better for the kids, then you should do it.  it's not fair to them to lose their childhood.|`|hA6JDWsFaa	honestly, i think maybe you're overreacting. and you're right, divorce will hurt the child, it did to my cousins. try harder, if you really love him, give him another chance, go out for the weekend, work at it, see how it goes, and if all fails, then I guess you should proceed with the divorce. whatever makes you happy.|`|AA11705300	Your counselor wasn't effective for your particular situation. Try another. Basically, what will help is learning to communicate with each other so that when you have the best intentions, you can act on them and be appreciated. And when you don't have the best intentions, you can be aware enough to see that you have imperfections and ask the other person to help you through a rough spot. You learn to do that with each other. If you are committed to making your marriage work, you can give this a few years and you and your husband will both mature - with counseling and some effot, you can be very happy together and have a stable, intact family. Who in the world told you that happy couples don't have doubts about their marriage? It happens at times to everyone. You hang in there, work through it, strive to make some good times happen together.|`|v0Cv36cNaa	Divorce should be a last resort.  try talking to him first.  See if you can work it out.  coming from a broke family as a child there is so much that I missed.  Things I wish I had or could have done.  No marriage is perfect, no relationship is perfect.  they take some work sometimes.    Oh, Mildred is my leader.|`|EzINMxsNaa	dont divorce. It'll be just another problem to deal with and make you hate eachother. You guys need to find eachother again. Maybe start all over with eachother. Divorcing may have "freedom" but you're an adult; there is no more freedom. You have a daughter so It's best you do her a favor by staying with your husband. You married him right? You must love him.|`|vUAjf0t1aa	I hate to say this, friend, but it sounds like you should divorce him. I was going to tell you you should go to counseling, but since you said it didn't help, then nevermind...Wouldn't it be better for your daughter to see mom and dad at different times and separately when you're both in a good mood? Would you want your kid to grow up seeing mom and dad fight? I think you should raise your kid in a healthy environment, and if you and your husband are constantly fighting, that isn't a good environment for a kid to grow up in. Good luck.|`|Hmne80oCaa	Hi there! We all have our differences... We may like and dislike things about our partner. I believe that you can mend things through civilized and mature communication, you're both an adult. I understand the pressure work and sometimes family brings, but then, that's all part of life. You say that he's a loving father and a very supportive husband, well I can say that's great. But you say you're being pressured when he gets irrational and freaks out. We can say that he has his shortcomings... But then we all have it.. we have to identify our shortcomings as well. Personally I don't believe in divorce... Imagine the confusion and pain your daughter would feel at an early age... I'm not saying that you suck it all up because of your daughter, in my opinion both of you would need to communicate to patch things up because you're a family. A family don't quit just because something bad is happening... that would be selfish. You mentioned that both of gone through counseling, well for me that's an indicator that you would like to stay together because you love each other and you're a family... it's just that there's one BIG bump that really rocked both of you, that's part of life. May both of you put up to the challenge and not despise it but instead learn the things it would like to teach you. God Speed! :)    If you would like to go through counseling again, maybe you can try John Gray.    http://www.mars-venus-counselors.com/|`|uAZ2whbkaa	Hi! My name is Janice. I'm still 13 years old.

AA10065812	***No, they are separate issues, and even with a false allegation of child sexual abuse, a father loses visitation rights.  If he's been convicted of it, and it was based on an actual event, than no, he won't get access, even if he's paying child support.    And yes, a false allegation can get a father jailed.  There was a case in 1995 involving a 12 year old girl, who at age 7, was coerced in accusing the father of sexual abuse.  When she was 12, she demanded to get her father's name cleared and get him out of jail.  She learned that soon after being jailed, he was killed by other inmates, as sexual abusers are not treated well in prison.  The day after learning that, she killed herself.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Child support is not "payment" for seeing the kids.  Child support is a legal financial obligation.  Visitation is a right that is granted to parents who choose to have a healthy relationship with thier child.  A man who is a convicted pedophile does not have healthy relationships with children.    If you're over 16, nobody can force you to visit with a convicted criminal.  If you're between 14-16, your wishes may be taken into consideration.. Still not likely that you'd be forced to visit with a convicted criminal.|`|AA11967247	your not going to have to visit him and the fact that he's a convict your not likely to see any money from him either. im not trying to be rude, its just unlikely.|`|S318F1ocaa	You do not pay child support  so you can have the services of the child as one would rent a limo...you are obligated because it is the law. No court would allow visitation but they all would grant you a portion of his wages. Stiff him for what he's worth if anything at all.|`|dQrBlk4qaa	No - he would have to petition the court for some sort of visitation, and since he's a convicted molester, the best he could possibly hope for is (after a lot of therapy and evaluation) for supervised visits - most likely taking place in a psychiatrist's office, ward, or with a law enforcement officer present.     Don't worry - a lot of this would be dependent upon doctor's working with both of you, and with a lot of court appearances. He'd have to spend an enormous amount wading through legal hell to get there.|`|v0Cv36cNaa	I cannot say for sure but I believe he can request visitation.  however, the judge may not grant such based on his record.  As for the support.  When i was younger my mother had my fathers wages garnished to collect back child support.  This only lasted until he told the payroll people to stop.  So there is legal ways to recover support.|`|a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	i don't know where you live.  but in maryland, child support enforcement makes sure that the father gets some kind of visitation if he is paying support (assuming he isn't insane or a criminal or something).  however, being that your dad is a criminal, there may be some way around that because he did harm to your sister, so it really isn't in her best interests to be around him.|`|jAGwyyuyaa	If your dad went to prison for molesting your sister, then he may not be allowed to be around you, your sister or any kids, period. I'm sure their are limitations to who he can see and who he is allowed to be around. And your mother will be the one to find out. For your safety.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Paying child support does not automatically give visitation. He needs to help pay for his kids. She should have done this before and quit waiting to get it done. You do not give your age but kids mostly over 10 (it varies state to state and county to county) talk to the kids when they do not want to go and they listen to the reasons why. If he was in for molesting your sister there is no way they will want him around you. The courts are for what is in the best interest of the child and keeping that child safe.|`|ViFCEb7Paa	Child support is to support the child with basic needs. No family court judge in their right mind would grant visitation to someone who is currently serving time and/or has sexually abused their offspring. He can request, you, your mother or who ever can contest it stating the valid reasons such as the abuse. If he is in prison, you will be collecting support from the state and they will in turn go after him when and if he ever becomes employed.
HjMbOgvqaa	Talk to your son and her ask them what is going on,then back off,when she sees how much she is going to lose maybe she will come around.It is like cesar milano,s comment be like the popular girl in school, no eye contact no physical contact ,no talking .She will figure it out and come around.She probably thinks she needs to exert her dominance to control the situation|`|AA12029875	why would you "do everything" for them?  Are they not adults?  Sounds like you are one of those "parents" who thinks they can control adult offspring by not pushing them out of the nest so they can learn how to fly, and then blaming them.  look at the real picture. it's in the mirror.|`|FHrQzaPqaa	take her to court and tell the judge that she will not let you see the   baby.
NQwljNOoaa	There are people like you describe.  They are insecure and they are trying to validate themselves by claiming to hate conflict.  Most times, they don't realize that they are the problem.  There is not much you can do with these people except be careful what you say to them.  I generally try to avoid those kind of people.
VALxlwYSaa	I couldn't tell you.   Use your words. Tell him the complete tuth. Be nice. And for god sakes don't ask to just be friends.   If he isn't the type to hate a person after a break up then you'll be fine. But if he explodes then tell him you really want to e friends.   But saying "Can we still be friends?" After dumping someone is like a mom saying "It's okay you can stil keep it." after your pet died.|`|rYaqoPTHaa	What I tell my x'es is that I only used them for a cheap ride and now I'm bored with them and want to move on.      You could take him to a nice spot far away from home and just leave...  That's what I do too.|`|lQGDV7MEaa	Even if you don't want to hurt him, he's going to be hurt anyways; that's how breakups work. Someone always gets hurt.  Just be honest with him and he'll eventually get over it and move on.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Tell him that you think he is the nicest and sweetest guy you know but you cant go out with him anymore because you are doing it for all the wrong reasons. What ever you do just tell the truth and DON'T lie. Maybe you can be friends?|`|ks2oieV0aa	There is no easy way to disappoint someone, just tell them that you want to always be his friend, but you just don't want to be in a relationship right now.  xox|`|AZVpLCuEaa	speaking from a guys stand point there isn't a nice way, just dont play games and get to the point|`|3ijLQe5laa	put him in the friends zone|`|ystl4DhTaa	Do it in person and let him know & be kind.|`|BWgV2xSZaa	"Im sorry but its just not working out, you're a great guy, but you mind if we just stay friends?"|`|KbZIsj7Caa	do it honestly, and truthfully|`|d7ITOY3Qaa	tell him that you rather be friends and start over again . thats the nicest thing to do .|`|cNySQ2axaa	tell him nicely tht u dont want to be more than friends. and say it face to face|`|aglLU9acaa	DO NOT break up with him over the phone. No matter who you are, phone break ups, and breakups over IM/internet are the harshest. You need to tell him, that you aren't interested in continuing the relationship and that you should see new people. don't sound mean, and don't try to sound bored with the relationship. also add that you can both be friends if HE wants, ((if you want to stay friends too)) because you both have to agree if a friendship after a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship could be awkward for either you, or him. be easy on him, he might act all tough, but he could be hurt badly, so you should try your best to be friends with him, as long as its not awkward for him.      P.S. I hope my advice helps!! =]    xoxo  Lindsay, the advice guru|`|pQBjqMkoaa	the truth will set you free|`|PmpbkocAaa	Think about why you are breaking up with this person. If you are simply upset with your partner, you should consider talking about what upset you and focus on resolving it, rather than ending the relationship. But if this same issue has already been discussed, yet nothing changes and you keep feeling unsatisfied, hurt, or betrayed, then breaking up might be the only way to end the pattern. Your partner will ask you why you want out, and you should be prepared with answers. Before having "the talk" that ends the relationship, do your best to articulate the reasons you are breaking up. If you have trouble remembering examples during emotional discussions or arguments, write your reasons down in advance. It may help to talk this over with someone you trust, or with a counselor.  Plan out how long you are willing to spend breaking up. The actual conversation in which you break up with this person can last a lot longer than it should, especially if your partner is devastated or completely surprised by your decision. It'll be much easier for you to stick to your guns if the conversation doesn't drag out. Expect to spend at least one hour breaking up, and longer if the relationship lasted a year or more. You may even want to arrange an appointment with a friend in a neutral location so that you can say "I'm supposed to meet John/Jane at the restaurant in fifteen minutes, so I have to go now."    Break up in person. It is easier to break up with someone if you don't have to look the person in the eye, but it can also be interpreted as cruel and cowardly. Unless you are a long distance away and choose not to wait until you see the person again, don't break up by phone, e-mail, or through an instant messenger system. And don't even think about breaking up with someone by pulling a disappearing act, even if it's just by suddenly eliminating contact with the person. The lack of closure can be psychologically damaging.        * If you don't live together, break the news at his/her home and in private. They'll want to feel safe enough to respond emotionally--no one wants to be broken up with in public or near family and friends, and risk bursting into tears, or be forced to bottle up all those emotions. While you can break up with them at your place, making someone go home after getting news like that will be difficult, and could make them more bitter. If you are at your partner's home, you can leave after you feel you've made your decision clear.      * If you live together, breaking-up will be particularly problematic and stressful; you should have a place where you can stay until the person you've broken up with digests the big change. You can either move all of your stuff while they're not home and then break up when they come home and notice, or break up and leave with some of your things with the intention to come back when things have calmed down to get the rest of your belongings. Either way will be very difficult for the other person, but only you know what's best for your situation.      Break up calmly. If you say the dreaded words "We need to talk", your partner will immediately know what's going on, and that's not a bad thing. You don't want to blurt out "We need to break up" out of the blue, or worse, when you're in an argument. You need to approach the whole thing calmly and peacefully, with a sense of resolution. Sit down with your partner and let him or her know that you've decided to end the relationship.    Expect any or all of the following reactions.        * Questioning -- He or she will want to know why, and whether there was anything he or she could have done to prevent the breakup. Answer the questions as honestly as possible.      * Crying -- The other person will likely be upset, and it will show. You can comfort him or her, but don't allow yourself to be manipulated into changing your decision.      * Arguing -- He or she may dispute anything you've said during the breakup, including examples you used in your reasons for breaking up. Don't get dragged into a fight, and don't split hairs. Let your partner know that arguing isn't going to change your decision.      * Bargaining or Begging -- He or she may offer to change, or to do things differently in order to preserve the relationship. If the person didn't change when you've discussed your problems in the past, it is too late to expect him or her to truly change now.      * Lashing Out -- Whether it's as simple as saying "You'll never find anyone as good as me" or as scary as saying "I'll make you regret this", he or she is usually just trying to make himself or herself feel better. Threats of physical harm, however, are serious and should not be ignored. If you feel that your safety is at risk, stay calm and leave quickly.      Distance yourself. It'll be difficult, but don't call them, don't go places where you know they frequent, and make yourself scarce. Take the time to reflect on your situation and learn more about yourself. Do all the t

Some lucky girls can get off just on kissing|`|37PpYx8oaa	Very normal.  Kissing is also foreplay, meaning it gets your body ready to do more.  All girls are different, but our bodies produce a natural lube for sex.

He isn't worth the fuss,|`|37PpYx8oaa	Most likely he does like someone else also.  But that's not a bad thing.  It's natural to have crushes on multiple people.      The difference is whether he acts on it or not.  Right now, he has only said yes to going to a dance with you.  At this stage you can't get jealous of other girls.    I suggest you wait until after the dance, see if things grow.  If he says he likes you and only wants to be with you then you're golden.    Good Luck and either way, I hope you have a rockin' time at the dance!!
5HtaeJPtaa	This is what I've told these friends:    "You know that I really care about you and respect you, right? I want you to really here this. Every time you put yourself down, you put me down. You insult me each time you say something negative about yourself because 1) it's not true and 2) I care about you and think very highly of you.  If someone else were saying those things about you, I would defend you and stand up for you. I would get your back. So that's what I'm doing now. I'm not going to let you talk about yourself like that - it's disrespectful to me as a friend. So from now on, please focus on being positive about yourself. It means a lot to me to be friends with someone who respects himself."    Afterward, a hug is optional.  Good luck!|`|zWEaAFwgaa	Tell them to listen up, and stop being such a whiner.  Explain to them why they shouldn't be putting themselves down.  If that doesn't work, recommend that they go see a psychologist.
PBdPD748aa	i dont think you are crazy or unhealthy if thats what you are worried about. the only reason i would recommend therapy is just so you know your feelings are okay and to get some support.    i really dont think anything is wrong with you, you are normal, you have your different opinions and feelings on things. everybody is different, regardless of what society implies. It is okay not to want marriage or children - you are changing every minute and nothing will stay the same for you.     i think you really need to fix things with your mother the best you can, dont let her suffocate or supress you - you are an adult now and you need to tell her that her role in your life needs to change. i think you should get a job whilst you study if it is possible, get motivated and save up and move out on your own one day. nothing is wrong with an independant woman - people envy that!     its not right that you think you are not normal just because you dont conform to what society portrays - we live in a pretty screwed up world - lets face it. and yes your views on relationship are very right - you seem to have a lot more wisdom and depth of thought than others - and this isnt a bad thing!     if you arent happy with your studies then consider transferring - i also am very deep and intuitive and for this i have chosen to study counselling (therapy) as business just wasnt doing it for me. try and see life in the best way you can, you only live once and thats why you should live and do the best you can!     there is love out there, but you are right that you need to love yourself first before anything can work. thats what you need to do. find things and people you find enjoyment in. find inner peace and realise that life can only get better, everything happens for a reason and life is what you make it|`|HiSVA9p8aa	First, I don't know that you need therapy but a visit to your doctor is certainly in order.    Second, if you post your question in the mental health section, rather than weddings, you'll get better responses.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Therapy never hurt anyone but the not knowing what you want to do.  That's normal for a 21 year old.  "I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want."  AMEN TO THAT! I am a nomad. I change careers every few years. I get bored...I move on to something that makes me happy again.  "Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? "  I don't understand how anyone can be happy with someone else if they aren't happy with themselves first.  Stop listening to your mother, and do what makes you happy.  It's your life now, not hers.  Just so you feel more at ease: I have a friend who works fast food in the bar district.  He is happier than ANY of my friends with master's degrees.  Do what makes you happy! and Good luck!|`|RUTQTgCyaa	You can do therapy if you want to but I think what you need to do is just take a step back and do some things that you want to do. I wish I could step back to your age and redo so much that I did in the past. No one can blame you for not knowing what it is that you want to do. Maybe you've never been in a relationship because you're not happy. Making yourself happy comes first and once that happens you'll have a relationship. The best part about that is that your relationship will be your relationship. It doesn't have to be traditional...it can be whatever you and the other person wants it to be. And that's the best part. Don't live your life for your mother or anyone else. Live it for you. Live is the key word. Enjoy yourself!|`|O15my3olaa	Wisest thing you can do these 30 days, is to take courage and go for therapy. See a psychologist first. Cheers! And good luck!
jZ03Zdjdaa	I would not expect any proposing to be done before the 1 year mark.  So do no prompting, hinting, nor pre-emptive encouraging.  But it's a good idea to find out if he believes in marriage, is on the same page as you about having/not having children, whether you handle money the same way, etc.  In other words, make sure you both are compatible and both believe in marriage at the same stage in life.    P.S.  I did no prompting, hinting, nor encouraging beyond one comment.  "I asked you out first, so if there's any proposing to be done, you will need to be the one who does it."|`|zaSyEcnqaa	I had been dating my boyfriend for 2 years and kinda sensed that he could just go on dating forever. He had been previously married and burned really bad because the ex was cheating on him.    It was hard to bring up, but very nicely, I talked to him and told him that I wanted to get married one day and have a family,that I did not want to just date forever and wake up and be 45 years old and dating someone. That I wanted to be a wife and have a home etc. and that I was not sure how he felt about all of that but if we were not on the same path or did not want the same things out of life, that we probably needed to revisit our relationship and make some difficult choices.    Surprisingly he said he wanted to get married one day. I did not know what one day meant. I was not on a time line, per se, but did not want to date another 5 years. We went looking at rings a couple months after that conversation, but I will admit I was getting antsy. When nothing happened , no proposal, I had resolved in my mind that we were going to have to probably just be friends because I was not willing to settle or wait much longer. I was ready to make the break, even though it would have hurt and I would have to start dating again. It was not what I wanted, but I had to honor myself and what I wanted out of life.    Anyhow, 4 months after I first brought it up, he completely caught me off guard and proposed with a beautiful ring.  I was shocked. It was a perfect, romantic proposal and I am glad I did not see it coming because it made it more special.    He later explained that he had to have time to get the $$ together for the ring ( he did not want to finance it). That was April 18, 2008.  We will be married June 20, 2009 and I couldn't be happier. That is about 3 1/2 years after we started dating.    I tell you the truth though. If I had not brought it up or expressed the desire of my heart for my future, I think he would have gone on dating me forever, though.    I would advise if you bring all this up to your boyfriend , do it in a loving and gentle way. Don't nag or bark at him or say it in anger or frustration. Be loving and true to yourself and what you want.    Good luck!    PS: I am now 36 and started dating fiance when I was 33. But don't worry about your age, I think with age I have learned more of what I want out of life . 30 is a great age and the perfect place to be . I am glad I was not married in my 20's as I was too young and silly. You are in a good place.|`|Mn1HTfqaaa	Ask questions about the future, but don't be too specific like pointing towards marriage. I would also ask the vitals like kids, house, etc.     You'll get there in time, but 10 months isn't all that long. Good luck and best wishes!
vj2pWs9Maa	You should say to him "Well at least this tough time for me has shown me how supportive you are or will be in the event of a crisis", meaning that he is NOT supportive of you at all.    I've been unemployed and it can be REALLY depressing.  It's no reflection on your character at all.  And with the economy the way it is, jobs are really hard to find.    You are doing all the right things, putting in an effort with your appearance.  100 - 200 applications is a lot.    Hang in there, keep trying, and don't put up with any criticism from your fiance.  I think he is extremely insensitive and unreasonable.  He should be a it more educated in what's going on with the economy and jobs.  And if he's going to kick you out, then honestly, he isn't the kind of guy who is going to look after you.
kqa9VFrfaa	Your hubby and his ex are the fools. Plez try to relax, and tell him that it would be helpful during your pregnancy if he was more supportive of U by not talking to his ex. He needs to grow up. If she has a new bf then she does not have a reason to be calling unless it is pure business like taxes or something. State your mind in a clear and loving way -- not threatening, and hope for the best.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	he is probably sleeping with her, or wants to start sleeping with her again, especially if he's hiding it from you.|`|S318F1ocaa	You lost your figure? What kind of wife are you?|`|VEwpTOROaa	stop talking to your man ,don t sleep with hi|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	if they have no kids together than they should have no contact in my eyes,   i think there is more to his side of the story with her than what he is telling you.especially  if he says he deleted her  's then still calls her,   i think you have every right to think and ask for respect after all he picked you not her,|`|ljwJr6u8aa	I would contact an old ex thats a friend. or just a male friend. I would also figure out how much money you would be getting from him in support. and also checking to see how you could make it without him. then lay all of it on him. tell him how much money that would leave him to live on. let him know that you could very well be wrong about it,but if keeps seeing her you are done with him. also tell him if he loves you he will stop her from coming around and calling. not to mention stop contacting her.I would go to school for nursing that way you can make up to 25-35 dollars an hr. being an lpn. or some job that makes enough money to where you don't have to rely on a man to make it.|`|rx20pKgOaa	It doesn't sound like there is much integrity in this relationship.  He left her for you, now he is in contact with her against your wishes.  It doesn't sound like he showed much respect when he was with her and now he's not showing much respect for you.    You're right, it makes you look like a fool.....    Only time will tell what the future holds for all this but I hope you weren't planning on growing old with this man cuse I suspect this rock will keep rolling.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	Seems to me you were seeing him while he was married to her! what goes around comes around!!|`|S6FLJ64Qaa	i don't know why you seem so surprised.  He cheated on her with you; kind of like the "karma train" running you down, huh?    He cheated once and he will cheat again.  (He probably already is cheating.)    Sorry.|`|2nwzCtbuaa	well honey i've been there twice and back and the second i got fed up wit it beyond my every nerve and emotion...i gave my husband at the time my bf an ultimatum its either her or me and everything we've built together you decide...and he did three months after that we got married. If you don't put a stop to it, then later it may not just be his ex wife it could be others or her again because he'll know that you are still there. Think about what you have and what are you willing to lose and is it worth it and are you willing to be strong alone? and if you conclude to stay then put a stop to it immediately and if you decide to leave you will have the courage and strength to move forward for your kids and yourself...
p0Y360fSaa	Hun, if you want this guy to be yours, fight for him. do NOT let this woman get a hold of your man, you should let her know how you feel and give her a fair warning to back off, but nicely to start.if she continues, just find the inner ***** inside of you and kick *** sweetie(: i hope you get the guy, im rooting for you! :D  best of luck,   emily    ps-pleaseeee answer my question?(: thankss.|`|KFXnVsTdaa	Take it as a competition. Give her all the encouragement to go for him. Because marriage is written in heaven. If he is destined for you, you will get him. Other wise he will just fade away|`|IDr0Pft4aa	HAHA Well go for it Girl!|`|dVgqFDpIaa	cool|`|Cyf4zKxBaa	Your an idiot, why would you say it didn't bother you one, two if he likes you then don't worry about it.|`|MixIcWUgaa	Obviously not a good friend, you should dump her|`|S852p6SXaa	the only reason why shes pretending to like him because she knows you do like him and for her thats a challenge. if  she can when this guy over before you can, then that will just boost up her ego even more and make her feel good about herself. i think you should have a really long talk with her just the two of you and tell her how you really feel about what shes doing.|`|lXVwGgHmaa	let kal know she doesn't have a chance|`|sZhTwzh4aa	okay, this "Kal" is just a sucky friend, tbh. that's like, an unwritten rule of friendship (hate to go all "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" on you...). You do NOT go after the same guy that your friend likes. Whoever liked him first, gets him, until he expresses interest in somebody else. Even then, it's iffy dating him, because your friend liked him. She's just being a b*tch. Tell her that it bothers you that she's flirting with the same guy you like, in front of your face, and you really wish she would stop. I guarantee you that she will be the opposite of apologetic-she will defend her behavior, if she's the kind of girl I think she is. You need to communicate with her, however. You also need new friends.
dwNW46wbaa	omg, weird! i thought it was just me.  these type of guys smile and make eye contact with you, when they pass by you, but never actually talk to you.  then, when you are stuck in the same class with them for one period the next quarter, you guys end up talkin, as if nothing was hinted in their eyes, and they brag to you in conversations about what they are doing with their girlfriends over the weekends.      secretly, i think these guys are really into us...^___^|`|37PpYx8oaa	Yes, they think you're cute!  If you want to pursue this, I suggest the next time you smile at them.  You say you're shy, but if you can get bold, wave to them.  Once you've taken those steps, you can toss out a casual "Hey" as you walk by, or even a "Hey, how's it going?"    Or just start with a smile this week, then move on to giving them a little more contact every time you see them.  Don't worry about it taking time, if they were in a rush they'd approach you.  And they will definitely like the attention!|`|0770fd55f95f18aa245026f830c7ded7aa	If you have their heads turning obviously they like something. So keep doing whatever it is your lol well if you like the extra attention anyways.|`|HmEZWD4faa	They loooovvvvee you! Ask em out before a hotter chick then yourself will get them first!|`|p0Y360fSaa	Damn, heads turning? haha, well these guys seem to have some intrest in you, so why not spark up a conversation some time? it cant hurt (;    best of luck,  emily  ps-pleaseeee answer my questionnn(: thankss|`|KFXnVsTdaa	People always notice the odd things first.

1gXA9rx8aa	when i read this. i thought of my hard time moving. i just moved for the first time last year. I have tips. be yourself. and don't trust people imidetly. a few people who wanted to be my friends ended up being jerks. So i would say be yourself, talk to people, and don't act shy.|`|b469RgNNaa	i had the same trouble. except i moved to the new school at the begenning of the year. all i can tell you is to be open and active with school activities. join a club. get involved with winter sports. be talkative, not shy. this is a whole new begenning for you. try to make the best of it. figure out why youre having a hard time at your current school and try your best not to do that at the new school. be friendly and not snobby. hope i helped :]|`|ev353FQMaa	I'm not saying be shy but I kept to myself and was really nice and it was okay :-)|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	The crowd can smell fear, be confident or they will turn on you.|`|x4zs37ZRaa	well ive been through that situation but what worked on me was just to try and talk to some people that are being nice and don't look like mean people but don't get nervous that's even worse|`|mzkfSwLwaa	I delt with this before the best thing you can do is be yourself and stay relaxed dont try to act cool and fit into groups by acting like them and what they say "cool" let people come to you but be afraid to talk to new people.|`|Gwp0wEnuaa	why dont u just get homeschooled things will go faster and you might even graduate 1 or 2 years earlier so you can be like "hah!" to your old school when you graduate as they watch you with envy!    :P    *planning to do the same thing! yayy!*|`|b9d09d935292dcc7a4c8127386489dc8aa	OMG i wish I could move to a new school. When u move you can be ANYTHING you want, change your appearance, wear new clothes, and remember don't be the quite new girl people stare out jump right in with people who like nice, and try to be social, but remember don't change yourself for other people and remember its just a new experience to start over, like New Years!|`|DFFFtE74aa	When I was in eight grade I had to move in the middle of the year to another country, so my most important advice to you would be to just relax and take it easy.  AND: Don't be afraid to join new sports or organizations, even outside of school(that's the best way to meet people with the same interest as you). Also don't be afraid to speak out and show people who you are. I learned the hard way that if you are nervous, quite and shy people will see that, think you are weird and will be careful about befriending you.
fzIeGPZYaa	seriously be warned; if he treats his family like that now he WILL ABSOLUTELY treat you like that in the future. He can make all the excuses he wants for how he treats them (And im sure he does) but if thats how he is with them its how he will be with you, sorry|`|J4W68owgaa	I would ABSOLUTELY be concerned. Everyone's parents screwed up in one way or another, but as adults we either need to 1.) Work to heal it 2.) Let it go 3.) Be an insensitive jerk like your husband.    I would encourage him to get some help with his issues regarding his past sweetie. Don't give up on him, but work with him to overcome his anger and resentment.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	This is your family due to the marriage, so you have a right to speak up. And this is a mirror onto the future.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	This is a bad sign indeed. He should be way more respectful of his family. Especially ma & pa. Say something if U can -- gently of course. Hubby sounds immature. He is way too old to be blaming his parents for this type of stuff. Good luck.|`|lgyPxg26aa	Talk to him about it.  Be concerned and caring and lay your fears out on the table.    It's not unusual for individuals to lay blame for our own faults at their parents doorsteps.  Let's face it, very few of us had idealistic childhoods.  Some of us have real reason to blame out parents.    He does need help sorting out these issues and, unless you are a counselor, you ain't it.      Time for couples therapy.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	This is a tough question.  I believe that you can tell how a man will treat you based on how he treats his mother.  I would be really scared too, if I were you, especially since he treats his sister poorly as well.  There seems to be some anger directed at women in general...    That said, he's your husband and you know him - we don't.  Do you ever talk to him about it?  Sometimes we don't even know we're being a jerk until someone calls us out on it.|`|agTCqkLDaa	You can tell how a man will treat his wife by how he treats his mother.    This is true for MOST cases.  I wouldn't be scared, but I'd be concerned.|`|jAGwyyuyaa	I would have to say something if my husband was that dis-respectful to his mother. And was so in-mature that he would treat his sister like crap. He sounds like a spoiled child. Did you not see this before you married him?|`|VEwpTOROaa	it s not your besniss stay out of it|`|fMEypXDYaa	Yes you should be scared and abuse is abuse regardless who it is directed towards, so you need to turn him in to the local abuse officials, even if he feels they didn't spend enough 'quality time' with him as a child, he has no reason to take any anger out on them now that they are older and unable to care to defend themselves against him. and if he can't take it out on them, then who else is he gonna take it out on? Bet it is you, he is a abuser, it is a short step between them and you.|`|dQrBlk4qaa	He probably is a jerk inside, but all is not lost!     Have a sit down, and approach the subject like this:     Tell him that you hope he can do something as a favor to you. Tell him that you've noticed for some time that his relationship with his mom and sis isn't the greatest, and you are upset about it. You hope that, for your sake and your possible offspring's sake he would be able to try to mend the fences, and try to be good to them despite all of the horrible things that might have happened in the past. Ask him as a personal favor.    Hopefully this will make him want to change his ways not because they're wrong per se, but as a way of making you happy. Many people will change if coaxed the right way.|`|TK0HKu0Iaa	My mother told me not to ever marry or date a man who treats his mother bad. She always said watch how a man treats his mother b/c it is a prime example of how he may treat you in the future.     I was hard headed and once had a boyfriend years ago who treated his mother like crap/ they did NOT get along. He's my ex now (he eventually became verbally abusive towards me). I would be a little worried and wonder if its resentment alone honestly he seems to have alot of unresolved issues.    ~Hope You're Able To Work Things Out...|`|5jMNBO2naa	divorce him    you violated the golden a rule    a man treats his mother like he will treat you    he is a child to blame any or all of his problems on his parents  part of growing up is accepting what you got and making the best of it  there have been plenty people who have come from adverse conditions  and not blames their parents  they just deal with it    you married a weak man    i am surprised you would stay with such a man  he ha no respect for his parents, much less elders.. what make you think he'll respect you?|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	yes i would be no respect for mom their will be none for you one day|`|K4d6PU10aa	you should try talking to him or convince him of going to therapy|`|qwCqhn61aa	Sounds like your next.

I told him and he wouldnt allow me in the dr room with him. He came out and said he didnt have it and that I cheated on him. Well, we both knew what a crock that was. I asked if there was another way besides one of us having cheated and my dr said only if we went form anal to vaginal sex without cleaning it could POSSIBLY cause the problem but unlikely. Well, guess thats my story, over explained sorry about that.
AA11644956	let me ask you this; how did the situation come about that you were shot?      i mean, if you engaged in gang activity, drug activity, whatever....she may feel like you live a dangerous lifestyle and you being shot was the last straw.    it's one thing to stand by your man, but when you have kids, you have to get them out of that sort of danger.    and if it IS gang related, her best bet IS to get rid of you. that kind of stuff is never over. more bloodshed will come from this, and she doesn't want to be there when sh*t hits the fan.            check out my sites:    My Fashion Site  http://www.styleandregalia.com/      My Rantings  http://unabashedly-raving-mad.blogspot.c...|`|vFCva8R5aa	umm, did'nt you just answer your own question ?|`|0lefOvkSaa	I think the bullet is interfering with your though process.|`|gfHutvEFaa	this question makes no sense. please rewrite it and resubmit.

It would be very hard to trust her after this, it's going to have to be earned.|`|0lefOvkSaa	what you are is emotionally weak,you want so bad for this to work out you are over looking the truth that is being thrown in your face.For what ever reason she feels drawn to her ex and does not love you enough to fight that.Its very possible you are the best thing that's ever happen to her but the heart is not a brain it runs on emotion and she is not strong enough to do the right thing.I would say ether learn to put up with her cheating or give her the door.|`|d20mM90uaa	um, just dump the skank and find someone who will love you to peices  yes dump the skanky hoe|`|z6YwEjlpaa	Remember that saying..."fool me once, shame on you but fool me twice shame on me" that's how this goes. Don't let her do this to you anymore. I would say you have given her your fair share of chances. Talking to old flames always ends up like this most of the time. There is always some connection made again. You seem like a really nice person and definetly understanding. I think any guy who found out more than twice about his wifes lies definetly deserves better. I hope things work out for you. -xoxox-|`|tClYrQ1vaa	truth be told we do crazy things for love.i don't really think that you can trust her. because she has told you the same thing over and over again i think if i were you i would just let her go and let things play out   she will see what she is missing and then she will know why she shouldn't have done these things. trust is what holds us together and if you don't have that then how are you going to trust her at all...|`|jO7EiSmeaa	She will not change.  Talking to an old friend/exis one thing, acting on it is another and it sounds like she intends to see him.  She's lied to you 2 or 3 times now and don't believe her anymore.  The trust has been broken.  I'm sorry.
RcAofGkIaa	Nope, but it depends on how you do it, to lean over in a friendly way and say, "I can't help but overhear your conversation, and I actually know the answer to the question you just asked if you don't mind me butting in" asks for their permission to join the conversation a little and makes it friendly.  If you just snap, "the answer is 42" and go back to reading, that would be rude.|`|t54UvTviaa	no it is not at all rude to tell the answer. as if both are stranger, means they are no fast/ close friends. as they are stranger to you. similarly u will also be stranger to them. so you can also start conversing. as if they are discussing something non personal topic.....this shows they are extrovert and keep on talking without any hestiation. so if you also want to put your point, you can poke your nose anytime because it will boost the discussion. and believe me might be your discussion can help you at some important point of time. so take part, it is not at all nonsensical to keep mum. Rather than saying you can put your point i will say you should put your point forward
t81MEJ82aa	You should tell your son the truth. Not how you still love him as your feelings and details of your relationship are none of your son's business and just outright inappropriate to discuss anyway. But talk about what he did and how it landed him in prison. You can also show him not to think negatively of his father and you can get the extra benefit of using this as a lesson to your son to not follow the same path.    I can't stand people who would tell their child that their father is a secret spy on a mission or something lol. Sheltering children doesn't work. Then the child grows up idolizing some myth, and has no idea where they came from. You can let him know what's up without praising or bad-mouthing his father. Don't put your own spin on things. Stick to the good old fashion truth.|`|szAj0WMmaa	If the child wants to know about his father, you should tell him the truth.|`|snmLiq9jaa	tell him the truth.|`|HRIbmp67aa	HE gave you the gift of life?  who did, YOUR dad, or you mean he gave you the gift of life meaning, you became pregnant with his seed?  either way it goes - HE's not responsible for your gift.  For those who don't believe in God, my answer is that the TWO of you made the child together.  For those who do believe in God, I think will agree when I say that God is responsible for your gift.    That's what I got in terms of ignorance. What do you tell your child?  Tell your child who his father is and let your child make his/her own mind up about how he/she feels about their father.  It isn't your place to help your child feel ANYTHING about his/her father anyway.|`|OBCvewW2aa	You should be honest.    If you don't teach your son to be progressive, understanding and open-minded then he'll just be another quick-to-judge, uptight fool bringing us down.|`|0lefOvkSaa	How old is this child that it is asking where or who its daddy is.Tell the child your daddy broke the law and is in jail but I love you enough for both of us.Please get over the "He Gave me a gift thing all he did was play in your garden and you got the seed,I doubt ether of you put any more thought into the miracle at that time.Be a good strong mom and support your baby let thoughts of the guy in jail fade away.If it was not a crime of violence then he should be out soon so deal with him then but tell your child the truth that's all he is asking for.
23bgwpD1aa	have you thought about what to wear?   try some of the karma sutra stuff.  get some oils for massages.     to make it fun try getting tickets to a comedy club.
JlDcVTVsaa	yes, it happens to most girls that had sex for the first time.  it might even happen the second and third time as well.    ps: dont forget condoms|`|TiIzwLUIaa	YES ITS NORMAL ALL GIRLS ARE DIFFRENT PL IF YOUR TO YOUNG TO BE HAVEING SEX USE A CONDOM OR DON'T DO IT AT ALL THIS QUESTION SOUND UR TOO YOUNG BUT NOT A DUM  ONE|`|eQaApazjaa	i agree with emmers    if ur having sex and u dont know if its normal or not that u bled then clearly ur uneducated and should not be having sex    ive known about this since i was like 13 (im 16 now)|`|weK4J8Khaa	Yes, it is...|`|GZqaWCGBaa	yeah its completly normal. the guy popped your cherry.|`|fT7cp20baa	lmao yes very normal|`|IscB3Ijzaa	some people do some dont    so for you its normal, but could be underlying causes.|`|s30Duwdraa	My goodness.. yes, it's normal.  You have just broken your hymen.    You know, asking such a question tells me that you are WAAAAAAY too young to be having sex.|`|wHDxWWhraa	i think this isn't the only case...it is so normal....|`|RGcXgjEDaa	Yes it is normal, nothing to worry about unless you continue to bleed
mAZi1eH7aa	Speaking in a scientific way about it, the first laws of attraction are always looks. Whatever we deem to be acceptable or beautiful is always, without question, the first and foremost importance. That is human nature.  The next thing is communication to determine if they are somewhat compatible and vice versa. Then it is acceptance and compromise. Basically getting to know them, and their quirks and idiosyncrasies, and accepting them as they are.  That is human nature and it is the same for both genders and all lifestyles.  Someone can have the greatest looks in the world and if the personality is not acceptable, then it doesn't matter. Someone can have the greatest personality and the most endearing traits anywhere, but if they do not appeal physically, then it will not work either. There has to be a balance.  After time and the relationship has grown and matured then the looks become less important and everything else becomes more important. However, looks do always matter.|`|lGBbWsuSaa	Ya know.. I ask this question to myself sometimes "what do I want in a girl" ...and yes its personality that counts the most. I mean yeah I want a good looking girl. Im 21 now and the older you get...the more you realize...that sh*t fades and personality goes a long way. we all have our preferances though. I like funny outgoing girls myself . I think its hot when a girl is smart though XD ...nothing can stop a smart woman =]|`|j4OBEeAlaa	well i value personality the most but anyway.she'd have to be either a brunette,a blond,or dark haired.petite cause i'm pretty short myself.she doesnt have to be really hot but cute is good.she has to be funny,also a bit serious and she'd need to know how to dress.seems alot i know  but i'm not as choosy as you might think
9cGQawyqaa	it has to be personal.  scavenger hunt leading to your dorm, have a dinner there and slow dance with him|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	Take him on a picnic.......don't forget the wine and special glasses.....nor the fishing poles.....he'll love it, and you will have created a memory that neither of you will forget!!!
VSVQHKwKaa	"I don't know if I'm looking into it way too much "    Yes, you are.    Why not trying harder to become her friend. Sounds like she is scared of being her own person and is looking for love. Are you so unconfident that your mother will like her more than you?    Don't worry about her actions. Just be a good sister and try to help the family get along.     Good Luck!|`|7MJSPGnhaa	Ever heard the phrase "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."|`|1LhZgZllaa	sometimes copying can be a form of flattery, or maybe she wants to build a relationship with you and doesn't know how to.|`|7PbJWEo1aa	aww thats really sweet. She feels lost it sounds and is looknig to you for guidance. Perhaps you could take her shopping and get her to create a new style of look. Or just do something crazy to see if she copies.    That is really sweet from my perspective but I bet you must be really annoyed!    Try saying "oi! get your own style!"
4c0zHQqWaa	From personal experience, don't pressure the issue. What they are doing is normal. They have lived most of their lives with their Mom and Dad. The 13 year old is more of an enabler to the 7 year old. The best thing to do would be is to politely ask your husband to not have the kids bringing pictures over and mentioning things about their mother unless it is urgent that they must say something.     Do your best to be a great Stepmother.  Taking on the Stepmother role is very hard, and I understand you have been with him for 4 years but kids always change. But remember to stand your ground, and don't treat them any different than you would treat your own children. That goes as far as rules/discipline, to spending alone time with each of them seperately.|`|Y1BElRm7aa	Tell them it's okay to have two mommys.     And you said "..and his kids keep bringing pictures.."  They're YOUR kids too now. Do something about it.|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	Heather has two mommies......But you can never replace the biological one.....|`|qsLhVZd8aa	You state the children can't change things, but you need to realize that YOU can't change the children and them wanting their family to be together.  Get over it.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	You're "supposed" by whom to be a family?  Look, you may not like it, but you are the step-mother.  Therefore, you will never be the kind of family that kids have with their biological parents.  There's nothing wrong with kids *wanting* their parents to get back together, even if it's unrealistic - children want a lot of things they can't have.  Stop fighting them, because doing so will only make them dislike you more.  You should focus your efforts on being the best step-mother you can be, and that's it - the rest will take care of itself.|`|SsI4LLUZaa	I think he started dating too soon without any regard to his children.  They are not ready to accept you and by forcing you on them, it builds resentment.  I don't know what happened to his first wife, but if she is dead they may miss her.  Have they ever gotten some professional help to discover what the root of the problem is?
vXubuAqzaa	sounds like hes definetly interested to me :D|`|bgWfcplBaa	If you like him, call him. It sounds like he likes you a lot, but I don't understand why he won't call you.  So did he just call and hang up before, or what?  I would be very careful, he doesn't sound very secure to me and insecurity always causes problems.|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	It sounds like there is love in the air.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I think it's shameful that you even admit that you, a married woman, are flirting like this!|`|t81MEJ82aa	So him telling you to call him anytime isn't a clue? Not at all?    You'll save yourself unnecessary worry if you are straightforward. If you want to talk to him again, then call.
7MJSPGnhaa	Do not contact her unless you intend to send the message that there is a chance for a reconciliation.  What you see as a simple birthday wish she will twist into a "does he or does he not want me back" conundrum that will torture her for weeks, if not months.        Let it go!|`|zDeFibxzaa	definately over? if so just leave her alone.if you must mail her a card,but if you dont want to complicate things it is best just to let it all go and move on|`|5DB6nOXkaa	Leave it be, especially if you broke up with her, she's healing and hearing from you will make it harder.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Send her a card , tell her you care about her and wish her Happy B-day.|`|QSodlfMraa	well if you guys are friend yeah, why not. my ex call me 4 days after my birth day, i was like dont call any more.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if it was an ugly break up then keep your distance.  it's much too soon to contact her.  It will only make things worse for her and possibly create problems for you.  She may mistake your contact as regret and that you want back in her life.  Just stay away for now.    if it had not been ugly then it would be fine to contact her.|`|ITfBQzg6aa	I say just text her it'll be easier on both of u..|`|0257d63f2ad2a28173df5b7b66b6909aaa	You should leave her alone.  Even if your intentions are good...you're only going to set her up to break her heart again.    She'll assume that you initiating contact will be your way of wanting to get back together.  Since you have no intentions on being with her again, leave her alone.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	I think it would just complicate things. Specially since you broke it off and she's hurting. You say it's over, it would probably just lead to false hope.|`|4c0zHQqWaa	No gift, absolutely not. This is coming from a womans POV. Send her a Birthday card in the mail with a giftcard. A gift is more of something from the heart. While you may still love her (not in the romantic, lovey dovey sense) Sending a picked out gift may mean something different to her.|`|6hBKoN6Jaa	If it is over, then let it be over.  You do not want to give false hopes to her.  Give it some time and maybe she'll call you when she stops hurting.|`|Yh63ysrzaa	If it is without a doubt over, as you claim - you need to just let it be.  Wishing her a happy birthday, having contact with her right now, will just make it harder.  You will not be helping at all!  No anonymous gift, no phone call, no anything.    It's like ripping off a band aid!  Quicker is better!    Good luck!|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	You've already hurt her enough. If it was ugly and just a week ago, leave her alone. At most text her Happy Birthday, but leave it brief. Don't call her, just let her get on with her life. And if you don't want to appear coldhearted, what's the point in making it anonymous?|`|0AShsMsoaa	you dumped your fiance and now you want to taunt her with a card on her birthday?  what a great guy you are.      lets call it as it is, you dumped her, so for petes sakes leave the poor girl alone.      she doesnt deserve to be tormented because you have a guilty conscience.  leave her alone and let her find a man who is better for her.    one mans trash is another mans treasure.|`|x3LclBZ0aa	i think if you just went thru a bad break up very recently, its best you leave her alone. i wonder who broke up with who?  dont give her a false sense of hope that if you greet her, then she might assume you wanna get back together. maybe send her a text and leave it at that.  i firmly believe in NO CONTACT when you just break up with someone. both of you need time to heal yourselves.|`|7jA1FiY8aa	You just ended a long-term relationship with an ugly breakup.  In these instances it's usually customary to wait until the person whose heart you shattered has stopped bleeding from every pore before you resume contact.  Leave her alone and let her heal.      "Happy Birthday?"  Are you freakin kidding me??  Get a clue, you idiot.|`|1HTRWrawaa	It's over, she needs time to get over the pain of breaking up. You are no longer in her life, so stay out of it and leave her alone.
IMPvzBk1aa	The problem has nothing to do with working nights.  I worked nights, PMs, and days on a rotating basis, and I did not act the way you are acting.  Your child will be permanently damaged from this abuse, the same as if you were physically beating her daily.  Get help and get help for your daughter as well.  There just is no excuse for having let this go on for four years of your daughter's life.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Besides anger counseling, you need to focus on counting slowly to 10 before lashing out. Just slow down the thought process and think before speaking.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	every time you go to open your mouth to be nasty, think of the consequences BEFORE you open your mouth!!!!|`|HjMbOgvqaa	You should go to a doc and get some blood test done. Maybe your hormones are out of whack and also you are probably tired.Try thinking twice before you lose it and find a way to relax like deep breathing or going for a walk and apologise talk to your husband and tell him you do not know what is going on.|`|0jmVA50Jaa	Your Husband can tolerate it and know that you are over worked and stressed out.  Probably not getting enough sleep.     BUT it is your Little Girl, who is gonna be continually traumatized if you don't stop.        What are you so mad about?   Think about it !    Many Mothers turn to counseling only to be put on  Valium or some other drug.   You don't need that.   You need to find Peace within yourself.      If you loose your Man, then it will be just you and the Little Girl.     Your Little Girl will grow up, missing the complete Family life.    Hopefully, your not a Pot head.   That is all they do too, is scream at any little thing.   Analyze yourself and figure it out.  The only one who can do it , is you.    I feel sorry for the Little Girl, she can not find silence and Peace by herself. You need to supply her with that.        Ask God to fill your life with Peace and Happiness.    Good Luck .|`|AA12029875	you are mad at something.  figure out what and correct it.  then you won't be mad for nothing anymore.  or do you really want to lose your family?  do you take your 4 yr. old to a babysitter so you can sleep without interruption?  work days  is it worth it (losing family) to work nights to save the cost of child care---Sorry you should have thought of all of these things before you......|`|WwoaUJ2Jaa	The problem is that you work nights and are not getting enough sleep. I go through similar problems. Is there any way you can work days or evenings? The 4 year old needs all of the attention she can get and you are worn out and tired and lets face it- our bodies are wired to sleep at night not in the day.|`|FHrQzaPqaa	you need to get you some help. make a appointment with a doctor  and tell him what is going on.
SOjOEAtlaa	Me and my Mom have never gotten along either.  Some people say it is just teenage stuff, but I think that if they don't try to see on the same level as you do you will never be able to feel comfortable talking to them about things and they will get worried about your lack of information and come to conclusions such as drugs.   She is probably just worried about you. Not knowing what is going on. Try telling her the little things. About a cute boy/girl in your History class or something. You don't have to give her all the details just give her little things. Maybe she will be glad she is a part of your social life a little and loosen up.|`|FHrQzaPqaa	you and your mother need to sit down and talk about what is the  problem is.|`|lC1VVt96aa	I find it so hard to believe that you fight with your Mother.  Your description of yourself leads me to believe that you are somewhat intelligent and if that is the case, you should be smart enough to respect your Mother and be able to avoid confrontations.  It  might take a while to break the habit of disagreeing, but you should be able to handle it.|`|B06HsXJFaa	sit down with your mom when she is in a good mood and talk about it...........good luck :-))|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	she gets upset because you are evidently not doing what she thinks you should be doing.    what can you do about it?  nothing!!!    you never did say what you fight about.   not that it matters.
DwTrJ9GTaa	i know its hard but if you you want to hang out with the emo kids then maybe you should wait tell there not in the group and its just one kid maybe you feel better going up to one person rather then a whole group ask them were he or she got there hoddie or pants start small|`|OtvAUGv1aa	LOL - OMG, I did this in high school and it was the best decision I ever made. It's simple - you just leave. And whatever you do, realize you're leaving the WHOLE group and not just a few.  Otherwise, you will become their next target.  Just go and like any relationship, give it time to blossom and grow.|`|5bViDPxVaa	Go for it :) i have the same problem as you but im rlly shy and im still trying to find a way to join that other group :) do wat is best for u. dont do wat is best for ur other friends.

HlaEUb3Uaa	I absolutely believe that yes, there is someone for everyone.  but you can't give up looking.  I'm also a believer that they are put close to you so that you can find them.  I am engaged to be married this summer.  Not trying to rub it in your face I'm only telling you why I believe this.  My parents moved around when I was little until I was 8.  I know another family who moved to the exact same places all around the same times as we did.  This family ran a bar in this town, then moved.  My parents then replaced them.  Eventually my parents moved to the same town as this other family.  They moved, my family moved.  And we ended up 20 kms apart, both families being unaware of the coincidence.  They knew eachother from the other towns but were not friends.  Years later when I'm grown I find this man who seems perfect to me.  He was in foster care and has lived many different places.  One being with the family from the town 20 kms away.  He was sent to this home around the same time my family came into direct contact with his.  He had been under my nose for years yet I never met him.  I just really find that funny, and it really makes me believe that there is someone for everyone|`|M8f4BorPaa	yes. but it does suck knowing u dont have that person yet. i feel ya. dont worry youll find someone!|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	For everyone? No. That is a mathematically impossible statement.    Good looking guy should not have much of a problem in attracting female attention; keeping it is another thing altogether. That is where personaility comes into play.    If you still have trouble, then consider lowering your standards, you should be able to find someone. But question is, will you be happy afterwards. Personally, I can't live a lie. I'd rather be miserable and alone than have a half-hearted relationship.    I can tell you though, falling in your lap will not likely net you Ms.Right if you are not a sociable person. Women would much rather play the role of Rapunzel.|`|mTgCeSz8aa	YES JUST LOOK!!|`|lwJiJOseaa	well i dont think there is.  i think theres people that fall in love, but not meant to be.  thats crap. its not true. but i believe that you could find someone,  just might take some time.|`|p0Y360fSaa	personally, i think there is.but im just a kid, so what do i know? personally, i think online dating is just cheap and you should go out and get the jist and feeling of what its like to be around someone you have feelings for.and the not getting out much thing, you'll never find the right somebody if you dont make an effort.i know thats not much but i do hope i helped.best of luckk. ps-please answer my questionn? thanks(:|`|7KAduk1daa	There is someone for everone-----if you believe it!  Your negative thinking, spawned from your negative beliefs, are definitely proving to be your greatest obstacle.  We've heard it a million times, "As a person thinketh, so is he" and "What you sow, you reap".  Why do we pay lip service to these sayings that have been around since the beginning of time?  Yeah, of course you need to put yourself out there and make yourself available because, as you suggest, she is not likely to fall into your lap.  But your making yourself more available will be a natural extension of your positive, proactive thinking.  It's amazing how this works: as you think positively and envision already having what you want----repeat, ALREADY HAVING WHAT YOU WANT-------you will take the necessary steps and life will open the necessary doors for you to achieve your heart's desire.  Just your asking the question on this forum is evidence that you ARE taking the appropriate first steps in the direction of your dreams.  But if you don't believe it, you will not see it.  Historically, people have always said, "I'll believe it when I see it", but it's the other way around: "You'll see it when you believe it!"      I wish you the best.|`|S852p6SXaa	not all the time.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	yea i think there is, but you just have to be patient and you gotta put youself out a little more and let people see you and don't be anti social|`|fTxwKBNBaa	Well, love cannot be put into an equation thus,  Nothing about love can be generalized.  However bear in mind that love according to the greek mythology is,  "People had 4 legs and 4 arms and 2 faces.  This creature was so perfect since it did not get tired easily, it could not be cheated since it was able to see both sides and it was too fast Zeus has torn it into two pieces and love is looking for your torn side to be strong as you used to be"   So you can see that, there are billions of people on the universe and according to many theories you might be searching one out of that million.  So please, take your time, as long as you are alive, and you are on this world you have a chance of finding that person.  If you do not find her, please remember that a life in search of a partner is never a waste.|`|wdiWO4asaa	Well I wont say EVERYBODY but MOST. Dude you're not going to find anyone inside your house. YOu have to go out. I mean if you feel that lonely then just try. Whats the worst that can happen. Getting rejected? Theres others you know. And if you're not bad looking and have a great personality your sure to get some1! So go on and give it a try!|`|KFUsmwItaa	Maybe. Maybe not with over 6.4 billion people in the world chances are you could find some one. Still lots of people stay single there whole lives. If you really wanna find some you got to get out there, cause I promise you miss right falling into to lap is at least a 1 in a billion chance. My personal advice is stop looking for miss right and go for miss right now and hopefully along the way you will find the one.
zzUgYFy4aa	write it all down    then practice what you will say next time    say it out loud and with confidence    organize your thoughts on paper
ECe1rgsdaa	This is what we are doing too! My future sister in law had all of us in the bridal party dance to Bringing sexy back by Justin Timberlake! It was so funny and we had so much more fun this way! We like it so much we are gonna do it too, diff. song though. I say go for it!|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Sounds like a a lot of fun.

Congrats!!|`|hiY7CCc7aa	Definately something nice and different  I'd say go for it  Not alot of people think of that
8lx7EWivaa	My advice would be to start going out on dates again, nothing serious. I'm going through a similar situation. But, I am the kind of man that's not going to allow a woman, or anyone for that matter, to dictate who, what, when, and where I do what I do. Get out have some fun, you deserve it. Once he sees that he is no longer in control he will get the hint. Have grown up conversations with him if that's even possible. Talk to him about other men, who you might date in the future. And even if he wants to play games, stay focused and be the mature adult. Don't allow the games to have power over you. Once he realizes he's not getting the same response as in the past, he will man up and realize the game is over. Good luck and stay strong.|`|ks2oieV0aa	You need to only Communicate with him concerning your child.  Take him to court and get child support.  Then there can be no more games.  Good Luck  xox|`|Wdv2hUDaaa	If your trying to get through to him to just be friends I suggest..(im 14 by the way...so im not a man..not yet at least)....talk with him...this isn't a matter of you 2..its a matter of all your baby....try to sit down and talk to him...it might help if you 2 both thought about the babies future and how such a thing can impact ones life...just try to advoid him when hes trying to chase you....talk to him...and let him know whose boss and show him what you think should happen|`|w1iHxDL1aa	Get a new man.|`|ebrup0uCaa	get another real man! just like my boyfriend damn hes a man!|`|GHzsnyJ0aa	u need to eat a crab u know dip it in some lemon juice then yea ur good|`|2imXzBHbaa	You had a child with a loser, now you have to deal with it. I dont know what else to say. Maybe if you get another bf, he wont keep trying to get with you, but dont count on it.|`|che6yXYNaa	You have to honestly tell him look i only wanna be your friend and if you keep pressing this issue we will cut off all communication and the only time we will speak is when we are exchanging our child. You can make this very difficult by always playing the custody battle. If he is late punish him and so forth. hope this helps
RiWehoPAaa	Always trust your gut|`|PBJ8gZccaa	is she what you want? is she the only thing you can think about?     i'd say fight for her. go get 'em tiger!|`|AA11375230	you should change    "Fight for her"  to  "Fight her"    it would be sweet.|`|S852p6SXaa	theres really know reason to fight over, she wanted out of the relationship and shes still pining over her ex obviously. you'll just be going back and forth for nothing, i think its best that you move on.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	don't fight it seems like its just a shady way of saying she doesn't want to be with you|`|vxVnHGm4aa	She seems really confused and just doesn't know what she wants right now. This could be your big step in this relationship if you do fight for her, because this could ultimately make up her mind for who she wants to be with during this confused state she seems to be in. Also if your gut is telling you to fight for her, then fight for her. Instincts are almost always right. Hope everything works out =)!|`|mvkIlbx4aa	get therapy?    trust me man, if she still has feelings for the ex, it will never work.  sorry to tell you man, but it's true.  happened to me, went through the same thing.  just find another girl.      funny thing, i'm in a relationship now with my ex gf's friend.  now for whatever reason my ex texts me randomly.  makes me feel good.      just move on, it'll get easier.|`|FZGNyoFtaa	If you want to be with her, you have officially become her "backup guy" who is needy and will put up with her. Stay away and keep your self respect, it will make you stronger as a man.|`|N9o2ZEtXaa	I would tell you to follow your gut and fight for her but you would only be fighting HER for HER and that would just be pointless ! If you have already told her exactly how you feel then leave it at that ,if not just send it in a letter or email and then leave it at that . If you love something and let it go and it comes back its meant to be . Dont make yourself crazy about this if you have given it your all .
5eb82f15d183d6d66fa6225d22e2faabaa	wow. that's sad. you would think your family would be capable of sharing the lovin'....    but maybe find that one special aunt or cousin to bond with and otherwise move on. find a group of friends that you fit well with & don't ever mention your cousin.|`|OtvAUGv1aa	Be a better person than she is - don't do anything crazy like attack a photographer with an umbrella or shave your head. Just be who you are and the true star will shine through.... and enjoy your life and not being followed by paparazzi.|`|AmPi1Khvaa	Show your family that your talented too.
AA12316366	i hate to say this but when you are down it is really hard to find a true friend i found this out the hard way through personal experience. seems everyone is just too wrapped up in themselves to care about others. i have a plaque on my wall stating;    love your enemies  just in case your friends  turn out to be  a bunch of bastards    written by r a dickson
KL6zuNuuaa	no ur not heartless, there is no reason staying in a relationship for the sake of being married.  time heals all wounds and there is nothing wrong with being divorced, just remember that wall could've been you.....|`|61Fwbi79aa	You are totally normal. When my wife left, it was weeks before I had any true emotions. Even if you are not religious, find a good Divorcecare class. It truly helped me through my darkest days|`|kqa9VFrfaa	U had a bad deal, now U can start over. U R wiser and stronger, and hopefully will not make same mistakes again. Good luck.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	no your not heartless, it just shows that you were ready for this divorce to happen, unfortunately it took this episode of his for it to happen. at least he broke the wall instead of you.    and don't be scared by being divorced, half of all marriages end that way.|`|m13CCGc1aa	No.  It sounds like you are just ready to move on with your life.  Mourn your marriage but move on.  A lot of people are divorced, it's not the end of the world.|`|u61yKsE3aa	First let me say that I'm sorry and I wish you the best.  Secondly you are not heartless.  I think from what you wrote that this is obviously for the best.  You prolly aren't being emotional because deep down you know it has been over for a while and is for the best.  Your parents are right it is not your fault.  You can't control anyones actions except your own.  you didn't hit the wall you didn't make him hit the wall it was beyond your control.  At this point all you can do is pick up and move on and it sounds like you are off to a good start.  Unfotunatly being a divorced woman in todays society is not uncommon you will be fine.  Good Luck|`|AA10248966	Let the cops see the broken wall. File charges against his treatment and the give details, and file charges for past harassment or threats...get a criminal order of protection against his ever stepping on the property, and that Will also help you in the divorce.,It'; is over and thank your Lucky Stars he hit the Wall and not you. He's abusive and  nuts!|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	No your not heartless.......your just relieved.|`|jAGwyyuyaa	No, you are not heartless. If you have to do everything your self any how, what do you need him for? Enjoy the peace and quite. Pick up your feet move on with out him. You can do better. Good luck|`|oeEsnwSMaa	good for you! thank God your parents did not get hurt! kick him to the curb!!!!|`|bcfc4a553a788c7a7c8b0ab6973ab6c7aa	No honey you are not heartless. You have had enough. When you reach that point you have nothing else to give. Not love not anger nothing. Now I will say later down the road after you heal. You will be able to reflect and learn about your relationship with him. But as for now you have nothing left to feel. You can only take so much and then you shut down and survive in the only sane way you can and that is NUMB. Good luck.|`|85JjEHU1aa	No dear you are not heartless...It just hasn't hit you yet. And who s to say that it will even hit you at all! Subconsciously you might really be feeling great that he left. Sometimes its just better to be alone. Having a partner isn't always best. Having the Right partner is whats best. Good Luck hun.|`|5jMNBO2naa	no  you, thankfully, are thinking logical  when you got married your were in your emotional state  and as you see it did not serve you well at all for life judgments like that  i doubt you'll feel guilty if at all for long  as sure you picked a wrong guy  but more importantly is that you accept the fact that you did and chances are you will not repeat the same mistake    and soon you will be a divorced women... so how is that supposed to make you be? a lesser person -- hardly.....    a divorced person is only stigmatized when their ideals come in conflict with reality    you are probably one of those who believe in marriage for life, believe it or not so are most people, the problem is that there are so many weak women and men out there, who tend to hide their flaws by being seductive or charming, that one forgets about the basic core values of compatibility that are a must for any marriage to grow and survive    the guilt is from thinking you failed.. well you did.. so what.. you also learned, and that is far more important lesson to take away from all this. marriage is work, and not for the lazy..it takes a strong person to truly seek the truth in any relationship, and then act on it, and not simple go for the bright and shiny people in life, who as you may not, are not what they seem|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	You're not heartless.  You sound (like you said) numb from all the emotions.    You need to let your emotions out.  Hit your bed (sounds crazy but, sometimes hitting things is very helpful...soft stuff don't get hurt).  Or write in your journal.  Are you still living w/ your parents?  Ask your mom to give you hug.  Watch a movie together and just spend some time close to her and then talk and let your emotion out.  It's weird to feel numb but, you're just trying to process everything.    Don't feel bad about his actions w/ the wall or how he treated you.  You deserve better and you sound like you have wonderful support from your parents.  Don't shut them out. You're worth it...and for anyone to not understand how valuable you are is a shame and a waste of your time.  Lean on your parentes and let them know how much you love them.    Keep feeling and don't be afriad...stop living like that and start a new life.    Good luck!|`|AA10886262	it is time....you are not wrong|`|FWadS6i5aa	You were very ready, you didnt want to fall into the same group of many of us but realize things will be better. Getting divorced is not the end of the world, its just the start of a new life. We all grow smarter and more mature and sometimes things like this happen. It is not a sign of failure but a sign of realizing we are not all perfect and each situation is not perfect. I would say gather your thoughts, become yourself again and look forward to the rest of your life..forget this little bump in the road and remember each day will offer you new challenges and rewards. good luck|`|PseVmBS8aa	Its over, you had enough, kick him out and move on  girl. let go, there is someone out there that is so much better. You know what to do. Get it done.
B2vGkiGoaa	dang.. sounds like something that happended in this show i once watched lol anywayz. I think she needs to hear it from HIS mouth.. tell that playa that if he doesnt be straight up wit his girl and tell her da truth.. then you will tell her. ( lol this is goin off on a tangent, but in the show when the girl told her friend, her friend just thought she was jelous,but then eventually she found out and apologized to da girl for not believing her) wish you da best of luck ^^|`|dGM6JGqdaa	You could just tell her you was testing your ex to see how faithful he was to her and nothing happened but explain what happened when you tested his faithfulness to her !|`|oil8ALh4aa	She needs to know  your her friend, and please be honest with her. Trust me, she may be pissed but its only for the best. She needs to know anyway that her boyfriend went along as well. He cheated, she should know. You went behind her back, she needs to know. Its part of friendship, and this is test of how strong it truely is.|`|R2BBjtaraa	I think you should be straight out and tell her.  It's best she hears it from you and not someone else.  If she finds out somehow she might not trust you again.  Just make sure you let her know how bad you feel.|`|m6xvhlJqaa	no|`|ev353FQMaa	no you didnt do anything....and you know how he feels about her....and that he doesnt care about you|`|rWQaXqlhaa	yes cause its not right  honesty is important otherwise the guilt kills|`|93wYTIuqaa	If you're a real friend, yes.    If you don't care, don't do it. Let him be the one to tell her.    But, if you are going to tell her, talk it over with him first. You can't 'agree to forget about it'. Make sure he knows you're going to tell her, even if he doesn't want you to.|`|fBdtvrWdaa	Yes. You made a huge mistake by betraying your friend that way. She should forgive you, especially after her conduct right after you and your boyfriend broke up. She has a right to know that her boyfriend was unfaithful so that she can decide to stay with him or move on and have a chance to find a truly wonderful and caring relationship rather than be tied down to his cheating ***.|`|5kYIteIHaa	Yes. Real Friends tell....but she did it to you...went out with him...honestly what kinda friend would go out with ur ex.|`|ChVtiWmyaa	Now a guidance counselor, your mom, and many moralists will say yes but Guess what, you are in the real world now. if you want to keep both him and your best friend I say you and he better keep your mouths shut about the situation.|`|GHzsnyJ0aa	whoa if your best frined goes and like takes ur bf then i would have ditched them long ago and as too what u two dis i duno tell the girl her guy cheated on dem and **** dere life up good u have de power in oyur hands its likeblack mail goin on|`|HmEZWD4faa	Tell her... they can't go New Yorker Style on you... So no worries... None at all...|`|i0DBIVc9aa	you must tell her. not to get revenge but just as an FYI for her that he isn't the most faithful guy. but she should have known that when he cheated on you with her.|`|DySxAylXaa	No... just let it be its a mistake ...|`|2TDtOdltaa	I know you probably don't want to tell her but it's probably best to. you need to tell her that the guy she's going out with isn't the best guy. if he'll be messing around with other girls she shouldn't be with him. Just do what's best for your friend.|`|UCKAiLN1aa	Don't tell her. It will just mess up all of you guys' relationships with each other. Just never do it again...ever. Good luck!|`|oOEaudwvaa	did she tell you when she started dating him?> && i don't think she such a friend going out with the man you love|`|ZZCTwXa4aa	yea just tell your that you were having fun but nothing serious shel understand if shes a real friend
153eMQmnaa	ok the first girl to comment hmm what type of guy is in a volunteer club ... some girls find that kind of stuff attractive i'm a guy and i'm like him we flirt constintally its just us... we don't like to be tied down its just not our style...one girl has managed to stop me from being a flirt and now i almost never flirt or even talk to girls ... how she did it... i showed i was interested in her by talking to her and me and he hangout at school she wanted to hang out with me and my friends one day then she wanted me to walk with her before class started.then she started to treat me like a bf no kissing though i walk her to class and guys like what they can't have (don't over do it) i asked her out twice but she keeps saying no.thats my story me and her say "i love you" when we have to goto class then we hug.ignore this next sentance.I LOVE HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ok umm if u think of a plan from the one she used then their u go.|`|hnEYB04Paa	Ask him and there are much better guys out there. Besides what kind of guy is in a volunteer club! Seriously.|`|i0DBIVc9aa	You NEVER date a guy that your going to school with. Lets just say that relationship don't work out and you find another guy. and that doesn't work out then they will call you the school slu*. So date guys and flirt all you want but don't date guys in your school...its just messy all around esp since its your first year. get a feel of it first go to places kids your age go and i bet you will see a cute guy from another school. plus guys that all the girls want are usually cheaters.   i hoped i helped... as for thursday just flirt but don't get involved
YUZub0Y2aa	You would Probally call him you 2nd cousin|`|mYAbq6fnaa	hes your second cousin. so just call him by his name, because he is not an uncle or anything like that... hes just like your normal cousins.|`|2TDtOdltaa	your cousin|`|7Fl5RzAFaa	I think he's technically your first cousin once removed?
m6xvhlJqaa	??????
hkQSqPEwaa	tell him you are having an affair with his friend.  That will show him.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	i'm certainly not going to help you make a fool out of yourself.    and, when you get caught, and you will, remember that i advised you not to do it...     i hope the consequences will be worth it!!!|`|3ae438759d1f82f0733d2a5dc01aba4daa	I'm sorry for the situation you are in right now. You probably won't think this answer is very helpful but revenge is not the answer. You can tell yourself over and over again of your dad's behavior but revenge is not the answer. Try talking to him and explain to him how you feel. If you cannot stand it maybe this is a cry of help from your dad. He needs your help so help him.|`|B4aB5XMaaa	anything.. infect the computer with something that only he would go on..., etc.. stuff that would get him framed only|`|FHrQzaPqaa	if you can not get along with your father go and lived with your mother.  are you old enough to move out?
AA11967247	at the very least have an attorney look over your agreement before its filed. you have to have someone in a legal office draft it anyway, or at least you should. even if its not contested you want the language of the stipulations to be clear and unambiguous. whats not contested now could possibly change in the future.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	No you do not. Uncontested divorces do not require the use of a lawyer, kids or not... contested do.  Since its uncontested that means you've already decided/agreed upon the custody situation. Its best to get all this in writing to further help the divorce process.  I used a document prep for my divorce (with 1 kid). They helped us nail out the custody arrangements as well as completed our divorce paperwork.|`|61Fwbi79aa	My ex and I both had lawyers, but we never used them. Our divorce was uncontested and we have two kids. Consult your lawyer, but if you are smart, you can write your own seperation agreement (I did) and have it looked over by the attny.     Try to keep it civil. It is best for the kids.     Good luck. It does get better|`|vi4JlnJvaa	As long as you are in agreement as to custody, child support, etc. but you'll at least need a paralegal for your protection.  My ex and I divorced on good terms and drew up temporary papers with joint custody.......then he (my ex) turned into Satan, got a lawyer behind my back, and sued me for full custody.  You never know.|`|AA10248966	Read   The Divorce Handbook    Then decide.|`|lG1j8t2Aaa	My husband and I were recently in the middle of a divorce-now we are trying to make things work-but he had a lawyer and I didn't. We went to court and everything that we had discussed before about our children was not the way he was saying it in the courtroom. I suggest that you have an attorney to be on the safe side, so that you don't end up in the mess I was in. Also where I live the judge is big on marriage counseling before he will sign off on it, also you have to take a parenting class.|`|jAGwyyuyaa	Yes, I don't believe you can have an un contested divorce with kids. Either way you have to have a lawyer.|`|AQBi862Jaa	Yeah, I had one with my exhusband. Had to do it though because my exhusband was overseas at the time...we both agreed to the divorce though once our second child was born. It was faster for a lawyer to get it done as it was.
Lwved4teaa	this may seem tacky to you but if its what youre looking for and no one knows it shouldnt matter... they have them at walmart.  its just the material without the clip and most of them are $10.  you add your own preferred type of clip or barrette to them and you cant beat the price!  im not having a veil but if i were id probably opt for that because the ones at most bridal stores can be up to $200!!!|`|di6p10Ifaa	You could always have a seamstress copy it for you and you could get the clip that you want and have him or her attach it. Or you could get the one you want and have them remove the comb and replace it with a clip at a seamstress. Hope this helps.|`|35gGeedIaa	http://www.veilshop.com/Veils_c_8.html    try this site out, hope it works for you :)
HfamMJIqaa	stupid. stupid. stupid.|`|FxpE8ivMaa	why would i help you be a moron?|`|LB9xWMIWaa	Plans don't fail people fail to plan!  Remember that when you go on your journey, make sure you know what your doing.  Six grand will get you pretty far, but you'll be stopped at the first entrance point if your parents report the money missing.  I would get into Canada or Mexico first, and move from there.  Do you really want to throw your life away because you didn't get into college?  I dropped out when I was 15 and am now an honor student in college at 30, have you ever thought about going to junior of community college to build up your gpa?  It's a tough road your picking, think it through, and if you do go PLAN!
kogsyGAPaa	she might hold a glance a bit longer, flash a cute little smile...  perhaps seem to go out of her way to start a conversation or get your attention. Some women even try to make men jealous by flirting with other men. Just try to tune in and try to analyze her actions. If she doesn't seem any different around you then she usually is in the workplace, she is likely not interested... although there is always the possibility of her being shy.  Good luck!
m13CCGc1aa	Tell them that you didn't find any children cute enough to steal yet or that you use children to make tasty stews.    Chances are the asker will be pretty confused by your answer and will hopefully not ask anymore annoying questions.|`|rDmMk9Soaa	If more people realized they have a choice rather than think it's what they are supposed to do, there would be a lot more childfree couples. I have always known that I did not want children. Many people who have children tell me what a smart decision that is. If someone looks down on you for that, it only because they wish they had thought of it sooner. Those that don't look down on you understand that it's not for everyone.    The short answer to their question might be, "Teenagers."|`|naijqNojaa	tell them the truth|`|pMKaf73kaa	"Not to be rude or anything, but its none of your business."|`|jAGwyyuyaa	Just did not want any. That's mutual decision between you and your wife. Tell them you love every one else's kids. Just did not want any of your own.|`|qwCqhn61aa	Whatever your reason is. Only you truly know. it's natural to ask that of a married couple.|`|ViFCEb7Paa	Skip the kids. Buy a fish instead. Less of a financial burden, less stressful to take care or and in the end when it's all said and done, you can just flush down the potty and walk away fulfilled.|`|vi4JlnJvaa	That there are already too many in the world; or that you don't want to raise a child in the kind of world we are now dealing with.|`|fDEXN5vdaa	Personal preference. Its your life and you're free to live it as you please. If they have a problem with it, then just take a step back and take a minute to way their issues verses your own happiness. I think you'll find that what they feel or have to say about the matter does not equate in the long run.|`|aqj4E7Aeaa	Tell them you prefer to be happy.    Or that you like to vacation in Europe instead of Disneyland.  Or that you can afford to max out your 401k.    Probably most of the people asking you that are jealous, a lot of people with kids, if you asked them if they'd do it again, most would say no.  Maybe not in public, but its true.      Kids are not a blessing, they are an expense, a very big expense.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Have fun with this! Make up some silly answers. It is really none of the other people's business, but some people ask just to be friendly if they do not know U well. Tell them that U know that God is almost finished with his human "Barbie & Ken" experiment, and that U are just making it easier for him when he cleans house. Or tell them U R saving taxpayers lots of money by not adding to the public school burden. Tell then U ordered your children fully grown and ready to support U, and they just have not been delivered yet. I'm sure U can think of more.|`|AA10248966	Personal decision.|`|WjSJBWl7aa	Ask them why they do have kids.    I'm the same - I can't STAND kids!|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	You dont need to defend your choice not to have kids ............just say you dont have them and leave it at that.
R8xlWKN2aa	having a vagina and boobs doesnt disable you from asking a question|`|oil8ALh4aa	Its sweet. :D:D|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Well its kinda.... idk... not traditional. But there's nothing wrong with it. I think it would be more romantic if you let the guy do it.|`|oxWpo4bqaa	Lame - drop some hints.|`|oOEaudwvaa	i don't like doing the asking cause i don't want to get turned down but there's nothing wrong with it i think most girls say the guy should ask is because there scared|`|M4L3QY3gaa	Personally, it's a fantasy of mine to be proposed to by my future-wife. I'd also like to take her last name.    So, from me, I guess it would be described as AWESOME.     But some guys are really old-fashioned and think he has to do it. Then again, a girl may want to get married now, or think she's ready, I guess. So if you want you shouldn't wait. He'll be pleaantly surprised, that's for sure.|`|PBJ8gZccaa	you know this is funny, because i was just thinking about this today.     i say do it!|`|AA10848105	def. sweet.  do it(:|`|RvmYqQtRaa	ahhhh sweet.|`|1RQOisKkaa	I THINK DATS A GREAT IDEA. GIRLS DO IT DO IT NOW :)
HmKY6qZDaa	Yes. I think she likes you. she is just being shy and she probably thinks you are really cute and sweet from afar but she doesn't know how to talk to you. Just start off slow with like casually join in a conversation with her if your friends are talking ot her or something. Good luck She def. likes yoU :)|`|ntqVD7Ataa	she probably does, just don't embarass her!  I bet she would love it if you sent her a note saying I like you.   She also may just be trying to be friends with you. Give her a chance.|`|AA12160092	It sounds like she does....so just talk to her first and see what happens...|`|3XUvLBtZaa	awhhhh! YES! she has a major crushhh.  Hey can you answer my question like this?|`|Bmzezkeeaa	She like u! You know I stares at my crush a lot! XD|`|GHzsnyJ0aa	she likes you but is shy u seem to like her go up to her and talk to her belive meh u wont regret it|`|ITxP16qZaa	thats what i do when i like a boy   lol  ask her out... or try   yes she does lol|`|b70DKNLvaa	YESS ecspecially if she stares at you haha i would know!if you like her ask her out!|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Yes ~ she likes you!|`|mUkvuERMaa	shes TOTALLY into you. i do the same thing to this guy, lol. |`|utsBDoffaa	r u fuckin that stupid of course she likes you, id hit that if i was you, but only if she is hot|`|4Hr1gjxgaa	omg sweety she likes u ALOT lol
27af90e0f6dfc8baff90052bd5ee1e76aa	can i blow him off in a nice sweet way? the disability wouldnt be so much the issue, but the name calling and the abusive. i'd be scared to date someone like that, he probably has low self esteem and i'd be afraid he'd try to bring me down with him, not trying to offend enyone. if he's comfortable with who he is, and accept who he is and not try to find company in his misery, then maybe.|`|oil8ALh4aa	****  Ill be honest, i'd back off. But dont listen to my opinion. I do actually know a few girls though that like it when thier boyfriends are agressive, and controlling. Like they actually say they like it. They say they also like to fight with them too, keeps them enterianed and wonderful make up sex. So its not hopeless.|`|2FhPfxnsaa	Do midgets date tall people? Sure, but it's rare.|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Wow, it sounds like you've dug yourself a very deep hole.|`|PogMq7Pcaa	yes i would. i would be kind! my sister has a disability so yes i would. i understand|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	i would not say it in a sweet way, unless he didnt mean to say it.     after all, guys are guys, and having a disability doesnt make it different. would you want a girl to feel sorry for you and not treat you like other guys, just b/c you have a disability?    not trying to be mean. im just stating that all men are equal and they shouldnt have girls feeling sorry for them|`|7QDZZXC7aa	That is a toughie.   I think it takes a very special, or perhaps patient person to go out with someone with a disability. But if you look at it in a different perspective, we all have some sort of "disability" even if it's the smallest thing.  The world is filled with all types of people, and i can assure you that there is someone nice enough who can understand your situation and love you when your calling her a c*nt and when your not.|`|2imXzBHbaa	I dont understand anything you said but asparagus. I love asparagus!|`|CAdFHF9zaa	that would be one stable woman|`|YIKNamxqaa	ah jesus that sucks man. I feel really bad for you. It's not hopeless you may find someone. With me its 10 million girls but nothing substantial relationship wise, just relax. Damned if you do, damned if you dont with girls.|`|GHzsnyJ0aa	no hot popular gurls would maybe like a nerd or sumtin|`|L2pkns9maa	I will tell him its not nice in a sweet way and never talk to him again...   When someone puts my safety at risk i will stay far away.|`|scoXsijqaa	thats sweet for some reason. i think it would be really sweet to go out with a special needs person. shows you care :)|`|KN8ikifHaa	You must of really mucked up if "At least I'm not severely retarded" is your defense. But good luck with that     Dork (whispered under my breath)|`|DnJXafIwaa	if she wasnt shallow and knew he could blow up even though he didnt mean it, than itd be okay|`|w1a9atsbaa	I'm sure there is a woman out there for you. She just needs patience and understanding.
hJDbOKR6aa	I highly doubt guys never like you.. more likely intimidated. You look pretty attractive in that picture, can't see how guys would overlook you..    Anyways, I wouldn't even worry about getting guys if I were you.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	They're just idiots, then, because you're pretty, and 'got out of your way to be nice.'    Yes, they do mature.
wGyDRhT7aa	That's just what they called the groom way back in the day. If you read wedding stuff from the Victorian era you'll see that alot when talking about the groom.|`|di6p10Ifaa	I would have never guessed it would have just been another term. Lol when I read your question, oh you are gonna laugh, this is what I thought. I thought a bridegroom was a modern term that people used to describe a groom that was taking over the planning! like a groomzilla! wow, thanks for asking this question!    I am glad I am not the only one that thought this!!! Hahah!! That is great!|`|PBdPD748aa	yeah well to be honest i had no idea until i had to fill out a notice of intended marriage form (aus) and there was a bride column and a bridegroom column!    well there you go, it certainly means groom :)|`|cGbTJobeaa	It's the same thing.|`|2WjcBrn1aa	Absolutely nothing. Just different terms.

Edit:  Find out what kind of music she likes?  And what kinds of movies she enjoys going too.  Was she married before and does she have kids?  Older women actually like talking about some of the same things you do.  You just have to find  out what she's interested in and then go from there.  Good luck.|`|NEbt7r1Saa	how olddd.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Retirement homes!|`|AwEspXiiaa	What it was like when they were young.|`|KWV6ZtBsaa	orgasms|`|FDEuHT7jaa	Money, like all women of all age|`|6S7CgcQoaa	how old???!!!|`|XIhG1u7caa	Talk about food, vacations, life. ?|`|LlGx1s7taa	hot sex, dirty sex, books about sex, movies about sex, docus about sex|`|Vp83Fuakaa	anything and everything mostly themselves|`|4XCg1mIMaa	the future, emotions, probably life's experiences.|`|rh12tX8Naa	older...like how old?|`|StJGeiFyaa	their kids and husbands|`|L2pkns9maa	Knitting|`|sp89XfT4aa	It depends on how old you are and how much older she is. Maybe about her job/career, kids, current events, local bars/restaurants|`|CBYFTjXHaa	talk about interesting things.  :DD    if you know what i mean.|`|l7wBoNMvaa	Probably things about the past, maybe History, Economy and other topics pertaining to politics and the nation.  Current Events would also work.|`|M8MlviOFaa	types of detegent for certain laundry loads.|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	theyre grandchildren & there illnesses, aches & pains & stoopid rare dieases they think they have.|`|W05lqxGHaa	like our garandmas???      well they like to talk about their pasts experiences in their lives|`|PmpbkocAaa	probably maintaining them and marriage|`|0k9IJYS1aa	future  weather  work  tell story  share experience    idk .. i'm 14 but i help out at community hospital|`|jrBWM8Tlaa	something other than the latest music videos|`|eMEgu2eyaa	dont act immature.  im in the 6th grade and i think that it is really annoying when guys act immature.  but other than that you should act yourself  and if she doesnt like you than shes not the girl for you.  and i know thats probably not the answer that you wanna hear but its the truth.    GOOD LUCK!!  :D|`|hVuIySZ9aa	depending on culture,work ethics,circumstances in here life etc these are some of the possibilities:    -family(if she had kids of course she would love to talk about them;if still single with no kids probably her immediate family.)    -work (how her day has been,what kind of work is she engaged with,something like that)    -general topics(younger women,sad to say,talk more about themselves & everything regarding them;some if not most older women,particularly the ones in their mid-30s to mid-40s were well-versed in some topic of general interest,be it the weather or what's going on around them.not that they are gossips though,but some are very observant of almost everything).    hope this helps.|`|RvddYKqjaa	A woman in that age bracket is in the prime of her life. She is interested in music, current events, and in her world. She may enjoy cooking or crafts, and she probably likes to read. She can do just about anything she puts her mind to, and can talk on most any subject. Just don't refer to her as "an older woman."  I think you will enjoy talking to her.
86PFQF4raa	My love is very strong at night,and at day,You are so beautiful darling,I am thinking of you 24/7,I love you so much sweetheart.|`|7AFLaiYjaa	wth! Love is love. It dosnt matter.|`|1KajpBdaaa	hmm love in the bed is definitely stronger than in the day lol|`|a2gbqlqTaa	to be honest...things are more emotion at night. your body is naturally more receptive to emotions late at night...you are more irritable, more loving, more sensual, more everything. it just has to do with it being late...so to be honest with you, it probably is a stronger word at night due to the body's reaction to it|`|f6dxZXPGaa	its strong 24/7 365 days a year like supermarket lol|`|wz8gx3gaaa	In night it is stronger.
d5bb26110388802dbda15ee2194e0da4aa	Emotional baggage...it ruins relationships.

zxq5QhNtaa	Just be BOLD! guys love bold girls with the whole confidence thing going on. He made the first move/gesture so nwo its your turn. If you know where he lives knock on his door and say something like you have an extra ticket to a concert, or just you wanna hang out sometime. But if you dont know where he lives ask a friend for his number.
BF8GlwyDaa	sometimes..... sometimes a guy wants a girl to cry and be upset so that he can make you feel better and think that he helped you.... and guys just like that.... sometimes guys could care less about a girls problems and when she comes and talks to him about her problems he would just wish you to shut up...... but it depends what kind of guy he is..... sometimes guys are really careing about if you tell them your problems.... it really just depends.... hope it helps......|`|ZFBL9D1aaa	When you show emotion, us guys like it.  Also, when you're feeling upset or sad or anything, it will let a guy know you're upset, sad, or whatever, and he can comfort you and whatnot. :]|`|dZ3X26EOaa	yea i like girls like u but i also like girls that show there emotions.it really doesnt matter to me.|`|k1FenuRLaa	no emotion is a bit boring. ppl prefer to kno how their partner or to come clear with any issues regarding their emotions.|`|jSkspBomaa	um....i dont really like that its sorta like talking to a robot lol  answer mine plz (check my profile)|`|0PbYE3M7aa	I personally like girls that i can see right through. it makes it easier to say and do the right things.|`|cHBcR0Chaa	it all depends on the guy. if you can find a good balance of showing emotion at certain times and holding it in the rest. it should work out just fine. me tho, i like a girl who shows emotion. makes me feel like shes asking for help without asking. yea thats all i got.
EQydFhzmaa	I'm sorry, but what an a--. I would suggest ending all ties with him. Any questions, just walk away from him. No comments, no waves, no calls; if anything - just glares.

He could just be a little rust in the "friend department" maybe he just needs a guy friend to talk to.

yP7mVYmqaa	Because most of the girls in my family are tsismosas.  Nahawa lang ako.    :P    Jk, I'm nosy, but not gossipy.  If there's a commotion, you're probably gonna see me in the crowd trying to figure out what happened. LOL!    I am one of the reasons why we have freeway traffics. My nosy a*s drives slow just to see the accident site.  x)|`|n53HeORBaa	come now boys don't make out stuff about girls, i don't think so, guys by nature make up fake stories about girls all the time to impress their friends and create that macho image, that is natural for you as gossip is important for us girls, we are not that gossipy we just talk a lot and some issues that are mundane to you guys are of mega important to us so that is not considered as being gossipy|`|8ssiOsDzaa	i'm a gossip but i don't really make up stuff, i just critisize people because they well, irritate me. or for no reason at all. it sucks i know and i might hate myself but it actually feels good, and knowing that other people might be talking about me as well doesn't bother me either. i think it's most probably because of people around us. everybody talks about everybody and so that's how it works! and you guys aren't that innocent either. you're worse than us actually. we just don't hide it|`|Oae9mimmaa	geez i have no idea!its really hard ta find friends cuz i dont do that ****.gossip is freakin stupid.  idk why most girls do that but its getting ridiculous.|`|el8yX5q3aa	YOU WANT TO REPHRASE THAT?  come on...I have heard guys talk and they DO TOO GOSSIP and downright lie about girls.      what world do you LIVE IN???  Be honest.....|`|J4gIGX56aa	well really its cuz its fun to talk about..because some of your frends  would agree with you and yea..and you get to know backround information on girls..
5d8ff2ba83304381d12c6e0005538ec4aa	2 weeks wow...yeah he's being a lil possessive too early, keep observing him for a while...|`|AA11967247	kinda obsessive|`|ZFBL9D1aaa	If he says "we" should go there in the summer, he obviously wants to still be with you and is serious about you two.  Trust me, because I'm a guy, and when we want to be serious and loving, we can be serious and loving.  There's nothing to be worried about, unless you don't want to be serious, as well.    Nothing is manipulative about it.|`|WELHdIjFaa	He probably has not had much experience when it comes to dating.
jgedIY8taa	I was very shy when I was a teenager, and its a difficult thing to overcome.  I would bet this guy would love it if you made the first move.  But don't be too over-the-top.  Maybe just tell him you'd like to talk to him privately for a few minutes and then tell him you really like him and would like to get to know him better, and would he like to get to know you better too?  Be prepared for kind of a stumbling, mumbling response, because that's what shy people do in unprepared situations.  And as you develop your friendship, and maybe later relationship with him, you may find that you're doing most of the talking at first, but that will change as he gets more comfortable with you.    The thing you may find, in fact, is that he will reveal a whole world of thoughts and dreams to you, the stuff he's been keeping inside all his life because he is so shy.  If he does that, it will mean something really special, because it will mean that you are really special.    Good luck!|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Ask the girl you're friends with. She knows him better than you, so she'll be able to give you her honest opinion.|`|AA11375230	its hot when girls move first.|`|WCFp0ODKaa	The Magic 8 Ball Says: Make the move|`|zJEvYQuOaa	blahblahblah.|`|iYprPfH5aa	You should go for it definitely or give him OBVIOUS hints.|`|NZ4iWM9maa	either get your friend to nudge him into asking, or just keep hanging out with him until you just sorta fall into dating|`|bpgq5Mhjaa	just ask him to go with you and his sister somewhere and have your friend bring a date so its like ur going 2gether but not rele.... or just ask him out he obviously likes u and u should go for it!|`|owoQ93WHaa	Just give him the greeeeeen liiiighttt.  by johnlegendandre3000    Im listening to it right now.|`|L2pkns9maa	I agree with turtle ask your friend who knows him|`|i98Gut3Maa	If you can, help the guy out.  I don't think he will get over his shyness right away, so help him out|`|ujTlIn8Saa	if you're the kind of person who is really out going, then i suggest to just try to open him up a little bit. hang out with him but nothin serious, just let him know you are committed.|`|xFeGxPtoaa	just keep in mind that if he is going too fast take it as a compliment but than again tell him to slow down in a joking way.|`|yPcv3VLPaa	ahh, well if you're really interested then i say go for it. maybe it will break him from his shyness and take off to the next level. haha you never know.|`|cHBcR0Chaa	Absolutely, guys love it when girls make the first move. Shyness goes away once they have a little bit on confidence built up. So go talk to him, and keep talking to him. Once he has confidence, it should open up a door and things can only get better from there|`|aOcfAdevaa	I think he would never get over the shyness...what you could do is ask his sister to hook you both up....or you could make the first move like  'Are you single?'   he says yeah  'wow a goodlooking guy like you single really, y?  and keep the conversation going and he would get the idea.|`|8AoGWNvnaa	Make the move.  Since you're really good friends with his sister, maybe you should make sure it's okay with her, first.  Maybe you don't want to lose her friendship over a maybe relationship.|`|7Tesm2vwaa	Go for it, guys are retards, I know, I am one...|`|CYKAGJMyaa	Make your move.|`|UotHmPaFaa	He won't get rid of his shyness if you don't help him with it. Talk to him ask him questions as often as you can make him talk eventually he will loosen up and will be more free with you and he might even ask you out himself.|`|Nhi8cxAvaa	He's shy simply because he likes you. You should make the first move but dont make him feel like a looser. be calm and sweet.|`|25d19e0400f6baeb5bf385259aaee257aa	Tell him you like him. Take my word for it, guys that age are really scared of being hurt, especially in public...especially by someone his sister knows.|`|bNx1q5oWaa	i would ask him cuz he seems interested and u like him so,go for him|`|sYOmJgklaa	let him know you like him and let it go from there|`|qsP6Umcpaa	well if hes shy u never will get him dat wai goo for it make ur first move or tell his sister dat u like him and tell her dat ask him to ask u out den he will get out of dat feeling or out of dat closet with dose power rangers     good luck|`|uqCc9pJyaa	well thats simple if he won't talk to you talk to him.. be the bold one and make the first move. this is coming from experience and a man so you know you are getting a great answer that works ^^|`|Xi6KGBG0aa	well i think you should make sure that your girlfriend doesnt mind you 2 getting together, could piss her off real bad    but ya i def think you should make the first move if u like him, y not?|`|6303924aca31975d4efe5df45761b87caa	I would concentrate on your schoolwork and possibly your job skills.  The fact that you would rely on a system like Yahoo! Answers to help you chart your next romance, tells me that if you don't quickly and aggressively work on your academics and your occupational prospects, our tax dollars are going to be supporting you extensively in the next few years.    I'd rather avoid that outcome, if possible.|`|rLvXFXQTaa	before making any choice you must thought about your future.   If you are still interested & want to have that guy as your boy friend.... etc. then propose him directly without any further delay.    Then exchange your thoughts to derive mutual conclusion how to move further with a like minded choice.  All The Best|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	suggest going somewhere with just him.|`|oTHGgowsaa	If he's really shy, I'd wait for him to make the first move, but he won't do it unless you drop hints showing that he wouldn't get shot down.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	You should make the first move because he may never get over his shyness!|`|xgui1LAFaa	first move, thats what hes waitin for|`|N2O9LUwaaa	Maybe be a little forward, to let him know that you're interested. But guys like to make the first move. It's a pride thing.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	No let him do all the work he'll soon come around and then it'll be chocolates , flowers , meals out etc , make sure he gets to drive a car soon aswell so he can take you places .|`|yeFZzstvaa	That's cute.   Yeah, let him know you're interested.  =]  Peace.|`|ea42eb25a8abec1d31b842b732c7d5e2aa	i'm no guy, but i would say you should make the move. i really don't think he'll get over his shyness anytime soon!|`|HimBbU6caa	Unwritten rule number six in the book of undying loyalty.      Never date a friend's brother or sister!|`|9vbiZNLtaa	well if ur sure hes into you def make first move im shy and i was so happy when my current girlfreind asked me out instead of vice versa so yea go for it|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Spend the night with your friend, wear a large T-shirt to bed, no underwear, and walk around so the brother can see you.|`|DIj072Sqaa	Make the first move. Waiting for someone to 'get over' shyness is a waste of time and presuming a guy will make the first move is very old fashioned.  It sounds as if he's waiting to see if there are any signs that you're interested before making the move so perhaps engineering a time when you're alone together could open the door to a more honest and open conversation.|`|Vp83Fuakaa	sleep over at her house see what happens
FWadS6i5aa	This happened to me many years ago, I wouldnt worry about it..you need a lawyer and get a divorce if your married, if not get one and make sure you have custody.  The most important thing is your children. they are very young and dont understand why this is happening..even if it has happened before they still dont fully understand. DONT BASH yourself..and DONT WAIT for her..you need to leave her alone..DONT try and get her back...LET HER GO or you will have this happen time and time again the rest of your life...BE Strong and firm with her..YOU deserve better and will find it.. There is not doubt she was having a affair with this guy..get angry and be tough with her..SHE shouldnt be welcome back|`|WewCtMpzaa	The only mistake you make is taking her back, if it really bothers you.    She is telling you crap like her new boyfriend is better to upset you, and put distance between you two.    I don't think you can control the visitation unless the guy is a known pedophile. You might as well warm up that this new guy will be in the picture for awhile.    I don't think it will last. Right now she is having fun because it's new and exciting. Young relationships are always fun, but you can tell it's impulsive because they moved right in with each other. The faster you shack up after leaving one relationship carries baggage into the next.    It's always ideal to get out, and live by yourself to do some healing before getting into another major relationship. It's rebound city if you push one big relationship to the next.     So no, it will not last. She approaching this new relationship too aggressively, and it will end about the same...|`|lgyPxg26aa	Dude, you don't have a wife.    Get a divorce, file for custody and find a real woman.|`|sbfJ3ma6aa	With the one age of the child you spoke of i'm not sure how much the child could do as far as saying if he/she wonts to live with she or you. Maybe, something will happen and she will come back in your life as the children also and everything will be like a fresh start and things will get better but if not then just worry about your kids and dont pay any attention to her besides getting a divorce to completly be free of her from now own!|`|m13CCGc1aa	The grass is always greener....    Agree to joint custody.  Children need both of their parents.  Be nice to her new boyfriend.  You'll end up looking like a great guy, even if it means you have to bite your tongue.    Once the normal stresses of life (bills, kids, puppy poop) become part of their everyday routine, her perfect relationship will be over.  It is likely that if he left his wife for your wife, he will leave your wife for someone new in only a matter of time.    I give it a year or less before your wife comes crawling back to you.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	this is very sad. I hate to hear this. I will say this though. there is no way that man is going to trust her because she wasn't faithful to you. then he will after a period of time think she won't be with him either.she will start to think that he went out with me when I was married and whats to say he won't with someone else. he will be running late and her mind will be going crazy, and vice a versa. as far as your feeling for her, you should not let the kids think you hate her. you shouldn't make them feel like they have to pick sides. they should love their mother no matter what.try to conceal your feelings, that way the kids can tell her you don't put her down. her actions will put her down more than your words.I would want a back ground check on him before letting the kids go there. but for custody reasons don't waste much time or it will play against you in court.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Let this one go, file yesterday. She'll learn when this new clown cheats on her.|`|mjKGbhNYaa	Gave my wife one chance and she blew it again.  I filed for divorce and she is bitterly fighting it because I owed it to her to take care of her when the guy dumped her.  She is a piece of raw sewage and I have not looked back.  She will regret me because I make good money, provided a good life and was a good husband.  I should not have married a woman divorced 3 times and it was never her fault!  Dump her, it is better than looking over your shoulder or catching AIDS|`|AQBi862Jaa	Ummmm, like didnt I respond to this a couple of nights ago??? Does the word get over it sound like anything to you?     DONT TAKE HER BACK. STOP FEELING SORRY FOR HER, IF YOU DO. FILE FOR CUSTODY OF THE KIDS. AND MAKE SURE YOU SET UP SOME SORT OF VISITATION ARRANGEMENTS SO THAT SHE CAN SEE HER KIDS. AND STOP...STOP....STOP....REPEATING THIS STUPID POSTING.|`|vj2pWs9Maa	Honestly, no I don't think it will last.  They both have loose morals so one will cheat on the other at some point.  Your wife is immature.  I hope you get custody of the kids because she sounds selfish and unstable.    If she comes crawling back, I hope you tell her where to go.|`|3jCNZmv3aa	If this is is the type of person that she is then why do you want her back? She has no right to put you and especially your kids through this. Listen to your kids. Do what is best for them. If she walked out on you and left the kids with you then she has abandoned you and you kids.  You can get sole custody of your kids not only based on that but on her previous behavior. Do not let her around your children. She sounds unstable. Also, as long as you continue to allow yourself to be her doormat by giving her the option of returning, she will continue to take advantage of you.  She should have grown up a long time ago. You have two children and do not have the time to raise another. She made her choice, now you have to make yours.|`|1kfeghDDaa	Don't you know that the BEST revenge is for you to LIVE your life like you never have before??  Do not call her again...come on..you can do so much better if you tried.    Stop focusing on her life and focus on you and your kids, I assure you..once you stop thinking of her and the damage that she did to you...your life will be so much better. Give it a shot, what do you have to loose? Good luck!
mYAbq6fnaa	just do some extra chores around the house, prepare a special dinner once in a while, when you go to the mall get your mom a new pair of earrings. just the little things that will help them appreciate you more. next time instead of not going to youth group, invite one of your friends from school to go with you so you wont be alone, and that will please your dad. good luck!|`|3ae438759d1f82f0733d2a5dc01aba4daa	I know its hard, but during recession time this is not easy. being a teenager is hard today , i get it parents dnt get you or listen to you and you feel like no matter how hard you can never impress your parents  your parents could lose their job any minute, you would be homeless, no food & water. their stress levels are so high . but you just have to deal with it, sorry !
Wdv2hUDaaa	I love with when a girl with put there head on my shoulder or even just touch my face or something totally random like..i love it when i can just talk to my gf from end on out...or even when she looks deeply in my eyes and we just hold it....it makes me feel like im actually wanted and my make at least one person happy in life ;)|`|zJEvYQuOaa	panis!|`|N53oHiwNaa	slowly work on him like grab his hand on put your hand on his leg ..that will for sure turn him on and if he likes you he will def like it then if you want just go for it ! good luck!|`|ujTlIn8Saa	ya make the move, then get over the first few awkward stages then SEXY time.|`|MX6aJfzFaa	Touch his knee or brush his neck while in conversation, wink at him, gently run your finger along his arms.

Why does the media actually makes you think that?|`|AA12166585	That's a tricky one. In my experience and most guys I've talked to they often have a "the one" girl that they really want who occupies a lot of their time but also have some lesser girls they know they may find some interest in.     But really, one is probably always going to be on top of the others.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	yes|`|3F6brF2xaa	yes i swear to God most Guys did|`|hsKFt4auaa	yes.
Dm9ouXV9aa	Try saying "Hey, I noticed that you have a really pretty smile. What's your name?"  Girls love compliments, and if she is smiling at you, she probably wants you to talk to her!|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Go up to her!
di6p10Ifaa	We seriously need to talk i am having the same exact issue. One of my "friends" has decided she is going to tell me what length of gown she will wear, i am paying, and she blows me off is rude to me about my wedding. I want her out but I don't know how to say i don't want you involved anymore in a kind way! I am planning on waiting until about 6 months before the wedding and then telling her. That way i can think about it some more. I hope this helps!|`|oxWpo4bqaa	Explain to her why - have you become close to new friends?   Family?     An odd number with groomsmen?       Be prepared for her to be hurt - but if you doesnt understand (as long as you are honest about it) then shes not a good friend.|`|18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	Well, the problem really is that you don't want to be "mean" (translate firm) about not having Julie in your wedding.    OK so tell her the truth - thank her but tell her that your bridal party is already set and you don't want to change it. If that doesn't do the trick just keep repeating the message until she goes away.    Save the "I don't want to be friends with you any more because of what you did (you don't elaborate on this but that's your business)" message for after the honeymoon. Then just not return calls, texts, emails etc. Eventually she'll get the idea that you don't want to have anything to do with her - in fact, she'll be on the "Friends" blog wondering what happened to your friendship.    And if she does finally get in touch with you - tell her the truth then as well. Tell her that you don't want to be friends any more because of whatever it was that she did. Make that plain and simple.     But also, make it final.     Of course, that means you can't go back - the friendship is over. kaput. ended. Let it stay dead and buried.|`|AA12338050	Be really nice about when you explain this to her.|`|76835e9a544163134ce35716229cd8f0aa	for yuh to nha want sum1 dhat used to be ur bestfriend in ur weddinq she must've done somethinq preetyy harsh.......listen its YOUR day and everythinq should be based on u n your fiance so be honest write her an email or call her and explain to her why you dont want her there...speakinq the truth doesnt have to be rude|`|8VbgGLXjaa	tell her to keep her skank *** away from your wedding
AA11853243	If you had an orgasm you would know it. Don't listen to the person who said that some women never have one. That's just not true. And it's not perverted.   First of all I wouldn't put too much stock in what all your friends say they could be making it up.  Also I agree that you shouldn't try too hard because you might end up hurting yourself. That is a pretty tender sensitive part of your body.   Look it up online. you will get some ideas for how to do it without hurting yourself. Then relax and have fun.|`|uAi1cdKFaa	vibrator|`|01xjZhtRaa	You might make that face you put at the bottom|`|AA12145970	whoa this is a weird questions concetrate on school|`|a8560dffc68323babeca5570faca48b6aa	explore yourself.. you will get there. : )|`|v8g8JHvCaa	:[|`|k1FenuRLaa	ur friends cud be lying. dont put too much effort into trying to get one and end up hurting urself. if ur gonna try then research how to do it first|`|YVRXdfGHaa	Everyone is different. So nobody can tell you exactly how to please yourself. You could try to get a trusted girlfriend to help you out if you aren't afraid of being called a lez.    You could study this site:    http://www.clitical.com/    There is plenty of information about self pleasure for females there.  Let me know how everything works out.|`|MT1498npaa	I'm sorry, but some girls just can't do it...|`|fTxwKBNBaa	Well not all woman touch themselves.   Some rub on objects, like chairs   And some use other stuff, such as the shower  So you should discover the way you like to do it,  try until you find it, and take your time, it is ok  not all the woman have to be the same : )|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	not perverted. it can be harder for some ppl. and you will know it when u get one. keep trying it will happen one day. honestly...you need to do the unmentionables....and watch porn maybe|`|L2pkns9maa	When your getting close to an orgasm, to feel tension and a pleasure, and your whole body starts to contract, toes curl and everything, Then when you reach orgasm you feel like a liquid has just been released and you feel relief soon after... also after you feel to urinate.  Good luck.|`|8m0OWTO8aa	Stimulate your clitorous, and use a vibrator or something for re-creating sex.|`|DQ5nx7GEaa	well you can watch porn and then rub your vagina. or you can get completely naked and hump a pillow or anything and rub ur vagina, its the best ever! or you can dry hump ur boyfriend. its when you wear your clothes and hump him, it feels great too|`|tuKY5Q7Waa	Some people have an easier time, some have it a bit harder.

Can't say how it feels like for women though >>|`|7iQ7Kkdjaa	ive heard its possible, but the girl was a whore. have you tried penis?|`|JhjzzHXpaa	Well, an orgasm feels something that is indescribable. In my case I can only get one if I'm having sex & if I'm on top. Not everybody is the same, especially down there.  Now I'm not saying go out and have sex with someone, just that not everyone can orgasm with just masturbation. :] hope this helped|`|kcX0A2dUaa	you have to be in the mood first of all.....or its not going to work..

iIry4mRzaa	Just tell her you don't want to commit yourself to something you won't be able to fully give your time to. Let her know you would love to practice together for "fun" but just don't want to start a band at this time.|`|TXCoUGgpaa	Wow...this is is a tough one. If it were me and my best friend was asking me to be in a band, I wouldn't agree right away, so you're right to think about it. I think that I would eventually just come out and tell her that I wasn't interested. Of course I wouldn't comment on her singing abilities though. Or you could kind of take her off the band idea for the moment. Maybe you could offer to help teach her an instrument. Of course that might require more dedication. Good Luck.|`|AA12316366	you  are going  to have to come up with an excuse i don't like lying but in this case a little white lie  would be appropriate. surely there must be others around that notice her lack of talent.|`|n53HeORBaa	well if she really is a friend, better tell her now then lift her hopes up then watch her humiliate herself in front of other people and get blamed for it for not telling that she is not a good singer, people tell white lies to make a person feel better and have confidence in themselves, that's true but trust me this is not one of this scenario,     just tell her that you love her and that you don't want to see her get embarrassed for she is not really that good, you might hurt her now but she would learn to appreciate your honesty|`|el8yX5q3aa	Just tell her no..that is a bigger commitment than you are willing to give.  It will take too much of your time and you don't have it to give.  wish her luck and tell her you will come see her.|`|oAyI70W5aa	say you dont have time!  and join a sport :)  haha    answermineplease  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|NICEuXYgaa	If all fails lie to her.  Tell her that you just simply don't have the time for it right now.|`|FIG58FVpaa	I'm going to play both sides of this argument.    1) What will it hurt to be in a band with her? It might be fun to write some songs with your friends. It might not be a "good" band but it will add to your experience which will help in your future bands.    2) Tell her you aren't interested. There's really no way to let her down easy. If she's a really close friend she'll know you're lying when you say you're "too busy" or something like that...|`|KWV6ZtBsaa	ahahahahaha  a rock  and a  hard place  funny stuff|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	If she's hot, no one will give a sheet if she can sing|`|wQSsw8QHaa	has she heard herself on tape tell her to go and try out for american idol they will tell her|`|UNV987Zoaa	just say u hav a hw and sports and a ton o other things going on at the moment so not right now but maybe in the future|`|2DO6zNzXaa	That sucks.... Say your busy?|`|GoWPQvgHaa	Just tell her or maybe suggest you or someone else be the singer and she can do backing vocals.  And she can have a tambourine to shake or something..|`|DwTrJ9GTaa	tell her the truth shes your friend thats what we do with are friends if you cant do that then tell here your to busy to be in a band right now but you will help her find someone new|`|N2xzSXosaa	Tell her you'd prefer to concentrate on other things.|`|AA12196812	UHhhh I know the feeling. Be very diplomatic, but firm, so she is not left thinking that maybe you'll agree if she only talks more to you. Tell her that right now you have some other plans and just can't commit yourself to a band.    You might try telling her that your music style is not compatible with her singing style - if you feel she'd not get upset about that. I guess nowadays you don't have to be particularly good in anything to be in a band (look at Mandy Moore and Lindsay Lohan and the rest)  but it sure helps... It would be useful for her to know that her singing is not good. But she will probably be upset.     Perhaps, rather than suggesting to her that her singing is bad, you could recommend she takes more singing classes?|`|vDs6we53aa	Just say you don't have the time to be in the band to focus on other issues like school and jenks i always lie yo it'll be all good in the end|`|qXg3idqXaa	tell her you don't have enough time to completely commit to it. or, if that doesn't work, say you aren't allowed to for some reason. that has absolutely nothing to do with her lack of singing ability, so she can't get mad at you at all!|`|plGuYnNDaa	Ahha well thats really nice of you not to hurt her feeling but thats tough! Im not sure what you should do.. maybe tell her its not a good time right now so she can find someone else.. or politely tell her she may need more practise before starting her own band.. Good luck!:)|`|5b5SxlRCaa	So about that vocal coach.....|`|GYORmM4Taa	just say you have plans already...like your going out of town or a birthday or something
AA12166585	You should grow some backbone and be open to him. No one likes playing hard to get when you play it as impossible to get. Build some communication between you guys. Approach him and start talking to him. Make comments about how maybe there's a movie you want to go see or a restaurant or whatever you want to go to. If he really wants to ask you out he should see this as a good opportunity for him to suggest that he could take you to one of these places.|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Well you have to start by talking to him. The first thing he says to you isn't going to be "Will you go out with me?". You have to initiate a friendship first and get to know each other better.|`|k4DxnbMCaa	You could try to get him on the topic. Things may fall into place after that. Worst comes to worst, tell him how you feel.

You may not like the way you snort when you laugh or how your mouth seems to work a whole minute before your brain does but before you can exude the aura of being likeable, you have to like your self first. This does not translate to being narcissistic but it means that you have to be comfortable of who you are. We all have our own insecurities, we just have to acknowledge they exist but build up on the things we know that we are great on.  Step2  Make him see you  Well, duh! This is a no-brainer but most of the time, out brain goes shopping for bags whenever it comes to men we like. Wave and say a polite good morning whenever you see him in the office or in school. Ask him what he thinks of the class if you do get to meet him on the elevator.  Step3  Nothing beats a good sense of humor  Some may be good at jokes, while others have their dry witty remarks. Just dont act like you are trying so hard as that is a turn off.  Step4  Patience is a virtue  It really is. And when it comes to having a guy like you back, you will need every ounce of patience you can find.|`|6S7CgcQoaa	just act like ur joking with... act like u think that person was lying and be like "someone told me u wanted my number"  make a convo and then bring up that u like him|`|iJZ5Efb0aa	you're better off at letting him come to you. this is why boys are supposed to be making all the moves. he already is showing interest by asking for your number, so he obviously likes you in some way. just, sometimes guys aren't going to jump so quickly when they're unsure. yes, he appears to like you, but don't automatically throw yourself on him and get so attached just yet. wait for him to come to you or you will scare him away.|`|ZvU093GPaa	If you really want him to make the first move try smiling at him and letting word get to him you are interested in him. than show up at one of his known hang outs when you know he will be there making it easy for him to ask you out.|`|4JFjxElyaa	show him ur ****|`|53d57dc247e593ec7f261beef136807faa	Just talk to him... say hello to him|`|1RQOisKkaa	2 U AND ALL FEMALES!!! JUST TALK. WE DO MOST OF THE WORK IN THE RELATIONSHIP ANYWAY. OKAY. GO UP TALK TO HIM TELL HIM  U LIKE HIM EXCHANGE DIGITS. THE END!.|`|ITxP16qZaa	heres what i would do..  Ask a friend to ask for his aim or email or   or something. Then on there ask if he has a gf, crush  etc. if he does ask who.   If he asks you then he has some sort of intrest back. Then start talking to him more often and in person. If you guys are getting along really well and stuff then have a friend ask him out or just ask him out yourself.   anyways remember dating is supposed to be kinda fun-- so have some too!   good luck |`|eb357a6f421c3b0a8108b02051b9950daa	just ask him  hey   u wanna hang out sometime.. th say this is my number  and tell him him call me  sometime  and whatever day you are free say by the way i  am free this day you wann do something or  hangout|`|kOb0gOGUaa	First just cuz someone said something doesn't mean its tru. If he isn't the one to say it u can't always believe it. He might like you though so don't give up. Do not get your friends to ask him for you thats the worst thing you can do it shows lack of confidence and he might end up liking your friend. Just saying. But if you want to get to know him maybe try just walking up to him and start a conversation it shows ur brave side.|`|S852p6SXaa	you realize you can just ask him out right?|`|1JY3GY41aa	as a guy, dont get a friend to do it for you, thats  lame    just make yourself noticable to him by walking by him and making and holding eye contact    talk to him, just say small things, dont try to hold a conversation, probably something like a witty observation|`|u2qBYTFKaa	well he probably hasnt asked u out yet because he doesn't know if u like him! just give him some clues that u like him like talking to him sometimes, and he will be more confident to ask you out. good luck! 
7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	What decisions do you want to be included in?    You havnt said what the ex is doing to harrass you?    Sometimes as a step mother, you have to take a step back, they are not your children to make decisions for.    Maybe try the Dr Phil website???|`|bO2rzfISaa	I'm in your position, except I'm happy. First of all, I took all his complaints about his marriage to her with a grain of salt. Second, I listen to his complaints about her now, but I remind him that HE chose her to be the mother of his children, so he'd better figure out how to co-parent the girls with her. Also, I get along with her. There is no reason that you should judge her based on what happened in their marriage, because you weren't there and you've only heard his side. What I'm saying is, let go of your need to dislike her. It's counterproductive.    As far as your husband goes, it's okay to just tell him what you will and won't do if he's not good at including you. Say, "I'm not ready to move again so soon," Then don't move.     I think you want to sort of threaten him with stories of failed marriages. It's a bad idea. It sounds to me like you have a lot of work to do to be doing everything right here, so it's a bad idea to start pushing your husband around.    Give yourself a break. This is your first marriage. Blended families are hard. You still have a lot to learn. Most of us do. Read some books; get some counseling. Tell him what you want in short sentences. Tell him what you will and won't do the same way. Don't wait for him to include you, jump right in.|`|rx20pKgOaa	You have a challenge in front of you and I wish you all the luck......the divorce rate for re-marriage is in the 70% range.  For the very reasons you are seeing, divided loyalties, decisions regarding ex's, dealing with children, etc.      This is an excellent website. I hope you find some help there. But you might consider counseling also. Get to counseling before you are in crisis, go just to get educated on the challenges and work of creating a blended family.    God bless and good luck.    http://www.successfulstepfamilies.com/|`|AQBi862Jaa	Yeah, sometimes I think that my exhusband's marriage is falling apart too do to issues revolving our two kids...but then I get his wife telling me how to parent my own kids and they are not even located in the states...my ex, his wife and kids all are stationed in Germany and in the army. I have different parenting ways for my kids and they have a different parenting plan that they follow with their kids. But when my ex has a problem with talking to me, he has his wife tell me like it is over the phone.     At least your husband however, would want to move close to see his kids, where as mine, would rather stay overseas when he re-enlists this year just so that they can get more money for staying over there than the states((his wife told me this over the phone and was very happy to not coming back to the states if he does come uppon orders to stay there)) and not come back to the states; he has not seen his kids in over two years. So yeah we all have problems...but this step mom has really lost her place.

But, she may have ruptured her hymen and still be a virgin. The hymen may break from a fall, or a misplaced tampon, or self stimulation. You need to trust her. End your relationship now! if there is any trust issues between the two of you.

3mHQQeLNaa	well if he does dat stuff than it's obious dat he likes u back and mayb u should ask him out... bc if a guy no's u like hom and he doesnt like u back he thinks ur wiered an doesnt talk 2 u any more.. it happened 2 my friend ...so he does like u back :)|`|968KfJjqaa	Hmm, I'd just keep doing what you're doing for a while, and if it leads nowhere tell him what you feel :)
lvJUDy78aa	if she is relatively healthy, then she might be anemic (low blood iron). A simple blood test would determine that.    The snoring might be due to sleep apnea. Overweight people have it more than others.|`|XxVTw5U3aa	maybe she has that disease where you fall alseep all the time...can't remember the name at the moment.  oh yeah narcolepsy|`|WMm7gbmGaa	maybe her being overweight cuts of circulation to her brain when she is sitting.|`|mjKGbhNYaa	narcolepsy|`|DwTrJ9GTaa	go to the doctor she needs help my aunt has the same thing but i cant remimber what they call it|`|teeQmWsBaa	She could have a sleeping disorder such as   Sleep Apnea. If she fits the other criteria for Apnea.|`|oOEaudwvaa	she may be sleep deprived|`|s5XBUsQRaa	its possible she has sleep apena she is not getting well rested at nite and could stop breathing at nite i also have this same problem have it checked out by your d.r.
hneetSf2aa	Tell it like it is...be honest..its the best way|`|AA12316366	with friends like you who needs enemies|`|NEbt7r1Saa	your screwed. im in the same position|`|GZzmcDeGaa	just tell her you do like him but you respect your friendship to much to do anything. you care about her and want her to be happy and your happy for them. if she gets mad she gets mad. but its just a little fight she'll get over it.|`|8ssiOsDzaa	you can tell jessica that she doesn't have to tell jenna since it won't change anything because you don't intend to do anything about it (like hit on the boyfriend or something) and if jenna finds out you can tell her that she's your friend and that this is what matters the most, and that no matter what you would never hurt her by going out or even trying to make a move on her boyfriend!  it might be ugly at first but when you explain that nothing will happen between you and the boyfriend and that your friendship is much more important than any guy she'll understand (i think it's important for you to tell her that you liked him before she went out with him because if you don't she might think it's new and it will get even more complicated)|`|n53HeORBaa	although you are the one that like this guy first he was never your boyfriend and worst he become one of your friends boyfriend, there is nothing wrong with liking your friends boyfriend as long as you don't snatch them from the arms of your friend if jenna actually asked you if it's true then don't panic casually shrugged and say "So, it's like not im going to steal him from you" have a good laugh about it be sure That your friend got the idea that you WOULD not steal her boyfriend|`|zJEvYQuOaa	blahblahblah|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	well so what you all like the same guy it does not matter. if he decided to go to you then they are unhappy and tha tis life. you are firends and should remain but i doubt you will you can't tell the one to shut up cause she would make it worse to the other firend . keep it light.|`|kLPaq30Eaa	It's not bad that you like her boyfriend... as long as you don't try to do anything about it. He has a girlfriend and that means he's unavailable. You don't need to tell Jessica anything. Just don't even bring it up to her. If Jenna says anything to you, I would tell her it isn't true, just so that she doesn't get angry with you or anything else. Just try to avoid the subject, and if it comes up, deny it.|`|EQaGQ6hWaa	if your friend is true to you she wont snitch you out but its not your fault its actually shows what a true friend you are by not going for him and letting your friend have him.yet again girls dont live your life for a man and dont let men come between your friendship|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	Okay, first off, it is NOT a bad thing. It's natural, and you just happen to like him. You can't help that. I mean, who can resist liking a great guy? Nobody! If you don't want Jessica to say anything, try telling her that it's nothing serious. Try to explain to her that you're NOT after Jenna's boyfriend, and that you're a loyal friend, therefore you'd NEVER steal her guy. When Jenna finds out, maybe you should tell her the truth. Lying to her would just upset her even more, and she would HOPEFULLY understand that you're a good friend, and have NO interest in stealing her boyfriend. I hope I was able to help. Good luck. :)|`|DwTrJ9GTaa	look its ok to like someone just dont act on it
ymMa6Pmiaa	Dude, look for a another girl.  She'll just do to you what she did to her ex, trust me.  And you'll end up as one of her boys. .. .|`|5Xu2eYiFaa	no.  hate to say it but ur dating a slut
oil8ALh4aa	Maybe he just thinks your pretty|`|2FhPfxnsaa	Maybe he's just captivated by your beauty! Lol, no really. Guys stare at hot girls, it's as old as dirt. I know this is a tough question to ask yourself but are you unapprochable, or unapprochably pretty? This may have to deal with the awkward flirting.|`|utsBDoffaa	he may have a weird kind of likeing of you, i would stay away though he is a student at a college where you work so hisbdick is off limits sorry|`|AA11439237	He might just be interested in you. Talk to him and see how it goes. Is there a big age difference between the two of you?|`|Loyk6Cmbaa	Maybe he has a crush on you? Just like what the first two answers say .|`|GHzsnyJ0aa	for some odd reason i couldent read that it all of the sudden whent like mixed and stuff|`|mvaPdekPaa	hes def. interested in u it sounds like... lol i would like to c tht stare tho.|`|nZ7pGQfFaa	I think he is interested.  If you are interested then ask him if he would like to hang out.
8ssiOsDzaa	it's a tantot mon amour, which means see you soon my love :)|`|J4W68owgaa	A tonto my love|`|XxVTw5U3aa	someone named tonto has your love?|`|WMm7gbmGaa	with tonto my love
TgDHFMOgaa	well im a girl and honestly the mood swings cud be pms lol  but i like it when guys DONT go all out and want to spend a whole lotta money on me.  You should take her to eat sumwhere you know she eats....like wendys or sumthing( not 4 vday tho).  I know it sounds cheap but trust me.  A too fancy date makes additional pressure that neither of you wud want.  take her sumwhere comfortable where you guys can chat about anything.....you cud where some jeans and a tee shirt..... especially becuz u guys aren't technically going out.  For vday you shud prolly ask her to go out with you! ( if you like her that much) o so romantic!|`|jSkspBomaa	lol I reaelly have no ideatry asking her like keep asking her lol  answer mine plz (check profile)|`|aNN4BtgSaa	um.. try the movies or something like that|`|3abdd48faae2c8d6b5056ede8dae4c2daa	movies|`|RyApVLzQaa	Just take her wherever you think she might like or you where you like.  Besides just taking her out should please her.
0M45cne5aa	I'm sure you didn't lose your mojo lol. Maybe this girl your trying to talk to is a little more hard to get, and you just have to step your mojo up. Or maybe she just really isn't that interested in you, and she just enjoys being a tease. I mean you can't REALLY make someone fall for you, no matter what you do. You can help your chances, but it's up to them when it comes to actually falling for you. I'm sure your time will come (:, maybe put this particular girl on hold! Good luck!|`|2nwzCtbuaa	Tease bak and everytime you know she wants you and you really want her and she makes the first move...deny her smile and walk away....|`|b70DKNLvaa	ok well give her a little attention but like play hard to get like if shes flirting with you just smile and act kinda like your not interested but at the same time like your not its hard to explain but when i flirt with guys and they act like they like me but dont pay attention to me it drives me nuts and i toltally want them:]]TRY IT IT WORKS!!!|`|QhXL4Lilaa	Actually it depends on the type of female, but one easy way ( I shouldn't be telling you this) but please her, give her what she wants mentally, tell her shes beautiful, even if she looks like shyt, you gotta let her know that she is what you want...  Physical action, be very gentle with her, kiss her softly, and look into her eyes and all that gay shyt...  Tease her back, do what sh3 does to you    she will be surprise how you feel and she'll be ready to drop them drawls, hope that helps... Let me know...|`|m0IVQxG1aa	Heh, alright, just a few tips to help out the guys-  Subtly mention something about us (nothing perverted!) like: I like your hair, you should wear it down like that more.// You look cute when you smile.  DONT! I repeat don't act like Mr. Hotshot / most chicks hate guys who act and think they're the "new $hit"  You ever see she needs an extra hand? help her  Hold the door open for her. We wont forget it, its charming and gentlemanly.  Give us little smiles and glances throughout the day, thats hard to ignore.  Oh by the way, this'll probrably only work if she's into you, but then again maybe thats why she's a tease in the first place eh?   Good Luck with your girl =]
wpi36XBAaa	" So as you can gather I am considered to be rude and nasty. Does anybody agree?" Add completely tactless and I think you'd be spot on.|`|ScZPVCUpaa	So you're not as horrible as some of the others, does that make you feel better?  What you say reflects your thoughts, and those are certainly negative.  I hope you develop empathy some day, but the fact you asked the  question means there's hope for you yet.|`|HdSaN24caa	you should remember one thing in life, IF IT DON'T STINK, DON'T STIR IT.|`|t9c4vOZmaa	Yeah because things happen accidents with tans and fake tans happen all the time.|`|qDG7FQsgaa	Just because something is true doesn't mean you should say it or point it out. You are right, she shouldn't have allowed herself to get sunburned, and of course the fake tan wouldn't cover that up. Every time she looks at her wedding pictures, she will be reminded of that fact. It is a pity since the pictures are a lifetime moment-o, but... she already knows that. In fact, she probably feels very badly about it. Very badly and stupid as well. There was no need to point it out to her. I imagine that you didn't say this with the intent of making her feel bad, but you shouldn't have said it for that very reason - it made her feel bad, if not worse than she already felt.|`|5jMNBO2naa	why would you care  they, and pretty much only they, will be the only ones who care about the wedding photos..  as for the new husband, he will even care less  since a wedding tends to be a one day show off contest for the insecure women getting married, the poor guy is stuck in it all    the good thing about such a photo is is documents real life as it happened  not some staged shot for the camera..  so if they are still married 5 years from now ( flip a coin for those odds )  they can look back and laugh at it all.. if they are broke up ( and i tend to favor this side of the coin ) then the photos will not matter one bit    as for you being rude and nasty... maybe you are immature..    as for credit.. look at my first comment...  why would you care    when i do go to weddings, sure i show up if asked ( if i really like the couple )  but i could care less the setting, what the bride and groom are wearing.. and so on..( as do most men ). .as long as there is free food and a open bar.... then i am there|`|5zu7AdlKaa	you should have been a little more sensitive it was her wedding after all not yours|`|0ff374a75a28871da57473c4784e0eeeaa	no, I would do the same. If your stupid enuff to go and get sunburned before your big day then get an ORANGE fake tan ya, ppl will talk im sure your not the only one, dont feel bad!!|`|wE89mPZ3aa	You should have known she was already on edge because of the wedding and all and let her mistake slide.  She did not want it to happen but it did and she had to accept it.  So you could have been a little more understanding and kept your thoughts to yourself .  Talking behind her back was not right either and a real friend would not have done it. Just talk to her and let her know that you were not trying to hurt her.  Sometimes we may really want to say what we think but we have to think about it and think about the outcome .
YVRXdfGHaa	It would be if she told me how and what she did and what she was thinking about while she did it.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	No. Not at all.|`|hvlcKINCaa	well, mabe because they lust sexuall activity as well, it is perfectly normal if you masturabate.|`|cHBcR0Chaa	to me, o yea big turn on. ask her what we was thinking when she did it, did she use toys, or just hand, how long did it last. stuff like that. get into the mood with her as she tells you what she did in detail. but yea, to me, big turn on.|`|ZNwV73Y0aa	depends on the guy|`|UOK5goRCaa	Well depends, where did she touch herself?    Her face??!?!?!? OH MY GOD YESSS!!!! ITS MAKING ME HORNY JUST THINKING ABOUT A GIRL TOUCHING HER FACE!!|`|sGoEj6qsaa	Very Hot!  I love that!|`|k1FenuRLaa	no, wot gave u that idea
AA11439237	Your logic is correct in that it seems strange to feel more uncomfortable after you've been going out. Next time you start going out with a guy just take a half step outside of your comfort zone and start and continue a conversation. If it helps you, pretend you aren't technically going out with him, and that you two are just interested in each other.|`|Xi6KGBG0aa	i used to be really shy before    the way i got over it was to just convince my self that i could care less about what others think about me
4kcXEwtTaa	Well I bet she loves you more than youknow!!!  and I bet that's why she stopped talking to Colton and willy   Caio is probably a good friend 2 her :) but if I was in your situation I would look at her perspective and understand how much she has done to be with you cause you have to understand she's younger then you    but I bet she loves you more then anything in the world ;)      Love your baby girl  Bailey|`|Ga9oCLavaa	start dating other women.....and made sure they called me alot.
EQaGQ6hWaa	she has to forgive the guy for wht he did to her and how he just used her but the thing is that she needs to know that its not the end of the world she just needs to stanf on her own feet and stop wasting her time on that guy because hes moved on and so should she otherwise shes not being fair to herself and her friends
VHR2Ff8Caa	If you were such close friends, then he should DEFINITELY remember you! Hopefully, though, he remembers how close you were! Good luck! :)
HjMbOgvqaa	Well do you think this is fair to your parents and do you think they will trust you when they find out.And what are your parents going with out so they can help you.The truth always comes out.|`|TtOCh3JSaa	I'd actually put that 2,000 of the money into a bank account for when you finish college and really need it. There's some good saving accounts with wicked interest rates at the moment and I'd blow the 500 on having a good time and if you ever feel your parents need the 2,000 I'd cough it up.|`|84crzC80aa	Well if you tell your mum and dad they'll probably still keep giving you money. Thats what they are for!You shouldn't lie to your mum & dad though.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	do the right thing, tell your parents. your in college now, its time you live  on your own and stop using your parents money, and if you get the oppurtunity where you can be independent and show your parents that, then take it. good luck!|`|F89MNQheaa	tell your parents, they would still help you because a bursary is for living costs and books etc but it only goes so far. dont be dishonest|`|7xmr5R6qaa	Maybe you should tell them, try not to live the high life with it later on you will need it.|`|l1KlZrAOaa	Tell your parents ... quit acting a spoiled little brat!|`|AA12350537	Put it this way, the truth ALWAYS come out in the end. Tell your parents and your honestly will be paid back with their own honesty and respect. It doesn't mean you can't still use a bit of the money to have fun, just try not to go crazy with it.|`|Rd3nNYNNaa	Tell your parents.|`|40a3d5b0131213ad65d94bbb95fb579aaa	You don't deserve the privilege of your education.|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	I say just keep it to your self but have responsible fun. And put some a side because when its all gone you never know something might come up. But just give a little something to your parents because they are helping you out.|`|FHrQzaPqaa	yes you should tell them. that is so wrong for you to do that.|`|Ad0C45Ioaa	That is a really selfish thing to do .I mean think about it your parents helped you out the least you can do is give them something bk in return.I mean you don't have to give everything to them but at least take them out somewhere for a meal and a few drink.Just to let them know that you appreciate all they have done . I Mean 2500 wont last forever and you will have to ask them for help again.BE FAIR.|`|FVhIaoT9aa	tell them, alot of poeple i know dont have the help you do off you parents. give them a break
K1UicE7kaa	I would say... "Yes"    Unless, they happen to be a doctor (or similar) that is totally dedicating/sacrificing their life for humanity... as a selfless act.    It is more a question surfaces... Do they have a flawed personality?|`|0zgolkhOaa	Not at all.  I find it pretty fun being 30 years old, making 110k yearly, and having bachelor parties every month with my buddies.  Some day I plan on marrying and having kids but really from my point of view and colleagues', its not a negative image.|`|J1kJb98Maa	which "society" are you talking about  its different for each country race religious groups|`|WVbMdohwaa	Unfortunately, yes. Although, over time, the image has gotten better as society has become more accepting of diversity.|`|zHwSyDNfaa	yup. it is expected for you to get married.|`|hnEYB04Paa	Well if they're ugly yes|`|nZ7pGQfFaa	I went out with someone who was 38 and was never married. Things didn't last between us... But yes, I think it's strange when someone has never been married at least once by the age of 40. It makes me wonder why, but then maybe the person hasn't found any one.|`|YK5y5m51aa	Well, i am 28 and I have never been married, and i am cool with that. I have never been discriminated in any way on grounds that i am single.  Besides, there are reasons and circumstances that make or force many people to opt for that. Studies, frequent overseas travels, bad relationship experiences/disappointments, bad financial situations, not having a suitable partner, etc
VHR2Ff8Caa	I'm sure that it's difficult to make friends when you move so much. In fact, it's also probably the cause of your social anxiety. Just don't let it get to your head. Try to ignore your anxiety, because acknowledging it just makes it worse. Also, try to meet people who you're able to keep in contact with. Good luck. :)|`|s5XBUsQRaa	i think you can always make friends will you be my friend|`|AA12316366	it isn't any wonder you have social anxiety, anyone would and you are right it is crazy i say just try to be cool as you can and try for new friends|`|DwTrJ9GTaa	dont think of this as not having friends think of it as having friends all over the states
IZKBRqp7aa	hopefully he doesnt like you just for your looks. you should go talk to him!! maybe you can hit it off^_^
Fi8AIi4baa	Hahahaha.  I was just like that. I sat behind the girl I liked in my Spanish class when I was 13.   Alright. Best thing to do is ask him for help, whether or not you need it. Be somewhat flirtatious, but not way too obvious. With the hair, I'm not sure if it really matters. Sure you can change it up a bit to see if he likes it, but the hair doesn't matter. Just be happy and inviting, and he'll talk to you, and maybe get to like you.|`|N9o2ZEtXaa	Just be yourself !!! Dont spend the rest of your life trying to impress people or trying to get them to notice you . Believe me once you have impressed them they just arent worth it anyways . Be yourself !!! Be yourself !!! Be yourself !!!|`|FdK1POvmaa	ask what he is doing this weekend. Not to go out, it's  a good conversation starter,|`|b7dp2PlHaa	Talk to him, you're chances of getting any negative feedback at all are so incredibly low, he'll either get what you're doing or he'll just think you're being friendly. No need to be really nervous, good luck.|`|odA1iz5Raa	rule number 1:  confidence- you must act as if your interested in him but not too much. to let him know your interested. talk flirt be nice and then before you feel like he thinks you like him just walk away do this a few times    rule number 2:   Attitude: be nice but not too nice that makes you seem fake  be cool but not too cool that makes you seem full of yourself  seem into him but not too much that will make you seem desperate     rule number 3:  be yourself. this whole dating thing,you will realize,is a whole lot of acting and you have to remember to keep your identity be confident and have a charming attitude but don'tt lose or forget who YOU are.  good luck kid|`|IAbPBvHWaa	just talk to him|`|9vbiZNLtaa	ok well first off going with the old "accidental"bump into him and dropping your books isnt a bad way to go. if that doesnt work say AGHHH i dont get this whenyour doing something hard "or easy =]" and ask him for help as for the hari it depens on him i personally like girls with red lips and wristbands are cool too =] hope i helped|`|zR0Dcdevaa	Go out on a limb, and talk to him first.  Wear something that you feel completely confident in, something that you know you look good in, but still look natural, and talk to him!
Rd3nNYNNaa	Talk to your friend and apologize if she thinks you did something wrong to her.|`|GHXz5Pdkaa	well maybe shes not your friend just ignore it and make new friends|`|kmLKKGGyaa	she needs to mature. what is she 5? sending someone to dump you as a friend? no she isn't worth your time get new friends that are able to confront you when they have a problem and are a little more mature, you deserve it.|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	Look, talk to her about it. That sounds pretty ridiculous (your situation, I mean) And, if she's actually a good friend, she wouldn't just ditch you like that. If she DID do that, then she isn't worth your time. Be the better person, and find some better friends. Good luck. :)|`|LXZyqGiyaa	Start by getting a tattoo with her name on it, that way she will know how much you truly care.|`|aupBzZGfaa	A real friend walks in while others walk out.    If she's walking out on you, she's not a real friend. Confront her about it and ask why she's doing this and tell her that you're over it if she is and try to make new friends. It's not always the easiest thing though...
FHrQzaPqaa	you are way too young to be going out with a 17 year old boy you are  only 15. your father is right.|`|ScHW4842aa	If it were my daughter - I would work out a scheme with her so that her father would think that she were sleeping over a friends house while the prom is on     i would also organise that she would take the blame for lying to me in the situation if her father finds out about it.     talk to your mother. she sounds like she understands.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	well no dad ever wants to see his 'little girl' grow up. he may be too overprotective, but hes really just worried about you and doesnt want to see you grow up. talk to your mom about this and have her talk to him. good luck!|`|8YMkyvhyaa	ha ha! i know what you mean because my parents will let me have a boyfriend, but im not allowed to go on a date alone. when he and i go to the movies, my parents go!!!    anyway, what you should do, is talk to your mom about it, then have your mom talke to your dad. and also when you talk to your mom, plan when she's going to talk with your dad. so maybe if you went to bed super early, then thats when your parents could talk.  good luck! i hope you get to go to prom!!!|`|KDHmaaQyaa	Sounds a lot like my Dad was while I was in high school. This is probably not what you want to hear right now, but hang in there. It'll get better, and before you know it you'll be done high school in college doing what you want. High school was a tough time, things definitely go uphill once you get out of there. My Dad has three daughters, he has a hard time letting any of us go but he's learning as we grow up. I guess just hang in there is what I'm trying to say!
fBdtvrWdaa	He's a dick! 100 pounds at your height is healthy! Dump him. You don't need someone so negative in your life while you are at the peak! You should be having fun not letting some *** tell you you arent good enough for him.|`|YVRXdfGHaa	Get rid of the dork. He's a nut case. You are as close to perfect as you can be.    Find a clinic that treats anorexia. Stand him in front of the door and tell him he can intercept one of the patients on the way in.|`|ZFBL9D1aaa	What the ****?  Seriously, he needs to stop talking.  If he really loved you, he wouldn't say that stuff.  If he loves you, he loves your body no matter what.|`|1KajpBdaaa	i think u should say he should grow some balls and quit telling u that if he wants a skinny gf go find some1 else|`|4AAVCLybaa	he should think you're sexy no matter how much you weigh. /:  tell him your boobs will shrink if you lose weight. hahaha.|`|OQ5ch42Aaa	Your 5'0 and 20 and weigh 100 pounds a little small don't you think?    If he can't love you the way you are then tell him to go found a skeleton if he wants bone death skinny.
