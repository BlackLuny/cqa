20090226082918AAoDQ3o	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Funny Joke: Censoring Dear Abby?	Star if you like it.      A single mother of a teenage daughter was reading “Dear Abby” and came across a published letter from “Concerned Aunt in Arizona.”  The letter’s author was stating that her six-year-old niece liked to go up to shirtless older men on really hot days and poke them in their belly buttons.  She was also worried about the girl’s mother, who wouldn’t do anything about this behaviour, saying it was “cute.”      This angered the single mother, and as she read it to her daughter, she told her, “I would never let you get away with anything like this!”  So the mother wrote into “Dear Abby,” telling exactly what the writer must do.  She asked the daughter to look it over for any mistakes in spelling and mechanics, but she quickly pointed out a certain mistake.      “There’s a word you need to change, Mom” she said.  “They won’t take it like this.”      “Nonsense,” said her mother.  “Now are there any spelling or mechanical mistakes?”  The daughter shook her head, so the mother took her letter, put it in an envelope, addressed and stamped it, and mailed it.      Six weeks passed, and the mother saw her letter in Dear Abby, but was surprised when she saw it.  Instead of what she originally wrote, she read, “That woman needs to tell her sister to curb her daughter’s behaviour now.”  The mother was livid, and showed it to her daughter as she ranted.      “I don’t get it!” she raved.  “I told them exactly what must be done to stop the behaviour, and they had the audacity to go and change my words around!”      “I tried to tell you, Mom,” her daughter replied.  “They’re not allowed to print things like, ‘tell her sister to whoop her daughter’s ***.'”

20090226084359AAJF0qb	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Can you imagine how much more press the octomom situation would be getting if the mom was a celebrity?	Given that lots of press people turned on that woman with the 14 kids after finding out her economic situation I can only imagine how much the news would be hammering her if it wasn't Nadya Suleman but like Angelina Jolie Voight, Rihanna, or one of those other really popular female celebrities that get plastered on the magazine covers all the time. Given that Beyonce and Mariah Carey both married recently and that the media kept wanting Beyonce to be pregnant well I bet the news would be nonstop covering them along with Jay-Z and Nick Cannon asking constant questions if they had ended up having six birth kids and then 8 more via in vitro fertilization. The negative press would have been on every single news and radio station and VH1 and all of that had Mariah Carey or Beyonce or Rihanna been the Octomom instead of Nadya simply because those other three women are already getting lots of press due to their careers as rich singers.

We ride the same bus and since the beginning of the year I've noticed him.   I just have this weird pull toward him and even though he's not amazingly hot, Im attracted to him.   Based on our signs what are the chances he's noticed me, just as Ive noticed him?   Unfortunately we've never talked, I'm too shy for that but.. still.         Also. If you're here to bash me about asking about astrology please don't bring that here. There are other questions and other people who are willing to take that but I'm not.   I do not let it control my life. Its interesting.   so the end.       ~Piscium   Thanks in advance.

20090131153811AACdZ1R	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	R&P: A Song For Your Ears (most of my fantasies are of.... edition)?	To Be of Use  Smog  Red Apple Falls [1995]  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VGIkpPOo...    What do you think of this song?  Love it? Hate it? Indifferent?  Somewhere in between?  What is your fantasy (or do I not want to know)?    Smog is Bill Callahan.  He also goes by (smog).  I'm not sure which one he's using today.   Today's song is a departure - while still lo-fi and self-produced, it's minimalist. No walls of sound, no noisy guitar noodling or distorted drums. Just an acoustic guitar and a man - a steel guitar punctuating things later on.  The sadness and regret is palpable; the mixture of selfishness and selflessness, knowing.  This song is perfect for introspection on a cold, rainy day.    Song 83 in a series.    Archive - Warners is blowing it up, so catch them while you can.  http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=...

As for Real, I think Cornfed was a pretty good choice for him. I'd rather Cornfed then Bay Bay Bay, that's for sure- I couldn't stand Bay Bay Bay!

20090131165302AADPZ2H	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	What are your dominant elements? ?	My dominant element is Fire ( 60 percent roughly ) and predominant is Air ( around 20 percent )       I lack water and earth.       I would say I am mostly fire. I have a very, very bad temper. Sometimes I can be violent but I am trying to work on that. I'm enthusiastic, cheerful, lively, and bold. With Air predominating, I like talking but sometimes can be distant. I also love learning new things.       As for what I lack, I'm not the most emotional person on the planet. I do have feelings, but I don't cry often. When I show emotion, it's usually by anger or happiness, but when I am sad, I don't usually show it or I withdraw. I probably experience anger more than sadness.    I'm not a realist. I'm an idealist but I'm not so idealistic that my goals are not attainable. I'm really bad with money and I don't usually think before I do something       I'm: Sagittarius sun, Leo moon, Aquarius rising, Sagittarius Mercury, Scorpio Venus, Aries Mars, Jupiter Gemini, Capricorn Saturn, Sagittarius Midheaven ( main stuff ).       What about you? Do you agree with it?        http://www.astrotheme.com/elements.php?i...    ( Above website will tell you which element is dominant in your chart! )

20090131173839AAET45m	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do You Like my story?	MY GF asks me to come over Friday night and have dinner with her parents.      Maybe because this is such a big event, she tells me that after dinner, she would like to have sex with me for the first time!YES!      I am sooooooo ecstatic, but I have never had sex before, so I take a trip to the pharmacy to get some condoms.   The pharmacist helps me for about half an hour.      He tells me everything there is to know about condoms and sex.    At the register, the pharmacist asks me how many condoms I'd like to buy a 3-pack, 10-pack or family pack. I insist  on the family pack because I think I will be rather busy, it being my first time and all.      That night, I show  up at my GF parent's house and meet  my GF at the door. "Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents! Come on in!"      I go inside and is taken to the dinner table where my GF's parents are seated. I quickly offer to say grace and bow my head. A minute passes, and I am still deep in prayer, with my head down 10 minutes pass, and still no movement from myself.      Finally, after 20 minutes with my head down, my GF leans over and whispers to me, "I had no idea you were this religious."      I turn , and whisper  back,   "I had no idea your father was a pharmacist!"

It seams just because you're in a relationship you're codependent.What happened to being with a person you adore and that's why you're in a commitment. DO you think most people are bitter?       BTW there is nothing wrong with taking a break from love and doing the single thing. But people should not down people who are happy in a situation either. You can be independent and still have a love life.      what's your thoughts on this?

20090131182809AAe4pzh	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Who else has Mars in Cancer?	Can you relate with these descriptions? Are you passionate like me?      Mars in Cancer      This position inclines toward passive-aggressiveness. These people seem to resist change and to shy away from direct confrontations. They need to feel secure before they act. As a result, they can appear rather slow at times. Their motto is "The best offence is defense". They may appear weak to some, but they can be very strong. Their strength lies in their tenaciousness!      Their sex drive can be very tied up with emotional need. At their best, they turn others on with a protective, almost therapeutic way about them. The protective nature of Cancer is best expressed when Mars in Cancer natives are turning the energy outward — when they are being the protectors of others. Turning it inwards is when there are problems. They must avoid over-sensitivity and self-protection when it comes to sex. Some Mars in Cancer people are especially turned on by the thought of creating a baby.       These people are threatened by indifference. They can be argumentative and manipulative. Their energy levels are variable, and they can appear to move rather slowly. They have defensive reactions and bursts of emotional displays when they feel cornered.      With reassurance and confidence, these natives are protective, helpful, and dependable in the long haul. They prefer to handle situations peacefully and humanely. (See also the Sexuality of Mars in Cancer).       Some Famous people with Mars in Cancer:  Joe Cocker, Richard Gere, Anjelica Huston, Stephen King, Cheryl Ladd, Anne Morrow Lindbergh (Sun, Moon, Mercury, and Mars in Cancer),  Keanu Reeves, Donald Sutherland (Sun, Mercury, and Mars in Cancer), Jean-Claude Van Damme

"I think that people shouldn't be ashamed to wear their scars, and show people, and even tell people "Look, I've been through lot of terrible stuff in my life", and there's no need to hide it....so, with the carnations, with everything like that, we all have that because we were all on five different paths and now we're on one path, together. And all of our scars will effect eachother directly. So we're tied together, for life."      because it's amazing, and if it's from an interview or a video, i would love to read it/see it      i've looked everywhere i can think of, and i can't find it, so any help would be appreciated      thanks

20090131170201AABNY89	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Am I weird when it comes to sex?	Ok.. I'm 16 and female. I lost my virginity a few months ago to a guy I love and really care about, but I seem to be really weird about sex. I mean, I like being with my boyfriend like that, but I get put off when people talk about it like it's nothing. Like they do it all the time with anyone just for fun. And I get put off when people use explicit words to describe body parts or sexual acts or whatever... I also get really put off when someone asks me anything about my sex life (if or if not they realize I have one)... and sometimes.. I don't know.. it just doesn't feel right to do it with my boyfriend, because everyone else is doing it and most of them for the wrong reasons. I just can't stand the thought of anyone doing it just to do it.. It literally makes me cringe. Is this weird?

20090131183845AAUxeqV	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Trying to find name of old monster movie! Help?	Hi,    A long time ago, when I was little, I was flipping through the channels (didn't have a menu like Directv or anything) and came across this scary sci-fi movie with a brown monster in it that literally looked like a piece of crap. It had one big, blue eye and one bigger arm and I think a small, useless arm. I'm almost positive they were in space on a ship of some sort.     The main scene I remember was at the end it showed the monster's blue eye staring at a housefly that was perched on the edge of its food bowl and it think the monster was in a cage or something.    I've been trying to find this movie for years now. It's an older monster movie. I've tried everything in google, but nothing. I'd like to see it again if someone can help me with a name of some sorts. Thank you.

I lost my apitite and got really really hot sometimes and then really really cold..       I can barely get things or I feel like I want to throw up       I've been eating multi symptom cold medicine for 6 days and I don't feel fully better yet...      I looked online for symptoms of everything and I' confused on what I have..      Thankyou.

20090226085245AAlidnT	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	What do you think of this song I've written?	It's called 'Slowly Fading Evening Sun'      Now the songbirds were still singing,   As dusk shrouded the room,   I thought I'd take a picture,   Of the sun from out the gloom,   And did I tick and time it,   And place it with the rest,   And show it to an angel,   'Cos I know she knows best.      Oh darling, shall we go and get things done,   Or would you rather sit and watch the slowly fading evening sun?      Now we had to get to be there,   And you know what it's all about,   When the people bring their things in,   Before we even checked 'em out.   And they said there is no pressure,   But we need a place to live,   And though I might forget it,   I know I'll never forgive.      Oh darling, shall we go and get things done,   Or would you rather sit and watch the slowly fading evening sun?      Now I'd been there for a short while,   Before that angel came along,   Who filled my mind with passion,   As she filled my heart with song,   And the wicked one she questioned,   How she could stay for free,   So I made the suggestion,   She should come and stay with me.      Oh darling, shall we go and get things done,   Or would you rather sit and watch the slowly fading evening sun?      Now the terror of the tenants,   Told us what it was about,   She said you both need your own space,   So I'll be shipping out.   But I'll have to put the rent up,   You see the mortgage must be paid,   And like fools we agreed to,   The worst mistake we'd ever made.      Oh darling, shall we go and get things done,   Or would you rather sit and watch the slowly fading evening sun?      Didn't take long to get settled,   Didn't take long to get to this,   And we made such preparations,   For a life of joy and bliss.   But the tenant's terror decided,   What true love was all about,   She said she'd be returning,   And we'd have to get out.      Oh darling, shall we go and get things done,   Or would you rather sit and watch the slowly fading evening sun?      Now the landlord was a preacher,   A very wealthy man of God,   And how the camel would fit through the needle,   Well I found it kind of odd.   But he treated us so sweetly,   Yes the pastor was very kind,   He said as soon as he first met us,   He'd already made up his mind.      Oh darling, shall we go and get things done,   Or would you rather sit and watch the slowly fading evening sun?      Well at first it all seemed perfect,   We were liberated at last.   But with the artist and shift-worker,   Well it all turned bad so fast.   And we just kept it quiet,   We kept it bottled in,   And when the artist just got noisier,   We just lived with the din.      Oh darling, shall we go and get things done,   Or would you rather sit and watch the slowly fading evening sun?      And one night they were fighting,   And he yelled a slammed the door,   That's when we both decided,   We couldn't take it any more.   And that is when she spotted,   Somewhere worth much more than it seems,   I guess we finally got to,   The destination of our dreams.      Oh darling, shall we go and get things done,   Or would you rather sit and watch the slowly fading evening sun?

It was so captivating and the acting was great.       Anyways, my question is how did they come up with that complex idea for a movie? It had a perfect balance of a good plot with India's state mixed in. Secondly, why at the end was Salim in a bath of money before he died? Was he aware that he was going to die?

20090226090356AARdZgR	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Male Pisces and Female Leo!?	I'm a male Pisces with the moon in Capricorn and Scorpio rising, It's also notable that I have Pluto dominating alone in the first house conjunct the ascendant, that gives me a lot of power. My Mid-heaven is in Leo and I also have the sun in the 5 house, I also have quite aggressive indications like Mars square Ascendant, Sun sex-tile Mars.   Now I've given you a profile, I don't act like a normal pisces,   even-though I would never physically hurt someone a lot of people still have hard to believe that. Anyone who knows me would agree on that I don't attack people (unless I'm being assaulted of course), nevertheless I look a bit dangerous, which is good in one way, a lot of the girls I've been with liked the mysteriously dangerous part of me!   Now I'm dating a leo girl that aren't really the typical leo either, she's much more calmer than I am (which is good! I like calm girls more since they balance me), she has the moon in Pisces, which is probably one of the big reasons to why I like her. Now everything seems great but I've heard that leo girls needs to be dominant even when they have a soft outer side, I don't mind giving her the control sometimes, (I'm still a Pisces you know) but most of the time I'll be the most dominant, not because I want to, It's just the way I am. That's why I'm wondering if we could live together or if she can't be satisfied in that situation because she wont be able to play the lioness role? The reason to why I'm asking you this is really only because I don't trust myself to do make an objective observation of this.         I'm a Pisces and she's a Lion, if you only went by sunsigns the result would be that she would dominate me, that's why it's more to it than sunsigns, I also wonder how much of the personality do you believe is determind by the sunsign? This is my first post here by the way!

I first heard this song a couple years ago, but have no clue how old it is and who sings it. Im trying to learn it for my girl, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
