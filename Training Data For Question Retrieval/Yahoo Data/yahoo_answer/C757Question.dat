I visit allrecipes.com for recipes and ideas -- and love the reviews section that gives me a general idea the success rate of the recipe before actually trying it for myself.      A few months ago, I started voting on the submitted photos.  Oh my -- some of those photos are outstanding.  I look forward to viewing and voting, and I have even discovered recipes that I never would have even imagined to look for otherwise.   When I happen upon an exceptional photo and recipe, I always add it to my recipe file.      Does anyone else look at this website .... if so:  do you look at the photos and vote for your favorites .... are there any other sites that offer this kind of feature?      Thanks

20090220074131AAsXXwd	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	What if the oven cannot be set to the same temperature as in the recipe?	I noticed for many baking recipes, the stated temperatures are something like 175C, 185C etc (using the Celsius scale for example). But I only have a microwave oven that has a convection oven feature and the temperature scale is only in 10 degree intervals eg. 170C, 180C, 190C etc.      For those of you with experience of baking using such ovens, generally do you set the temperature to the next highest setting or the lower setting? Eg. recipe calls for 175C, do you use 170C or 180C? Would the approach be different when baking cakes compared to roasting meats?

20090220081826AAAJFzC	Food & Drink;Entertaining	Need Help with Scavenger Hunt for 13th B-Day Party Tomorrow?	I am hosting a party for a girl who is turning 13 it will be a sleepover party at a hotel but before they go to the hotel they will be doing a scavenger hunt. I had some ideas for this but wanted to know if they sound good or if anyone had anymore ideas. I wanted it to be a mix of different scavenger hunt elements to collect items, collect information, take photos and also small riddles.       They will be split into two teams "Pink Panthers" and "Green Grasshoppers" We have two adult drivers I am one. I was thinking about having the drivers hand out an envelope that would have the location inside it in Riddle Form example would be "The Queen's Husband" and "Meat between two Buns" The location answer would be Burgger King once the team figured out the location they would be given an envelope with the tasks for example Buy a Orange Slushy and get a Crown that one team member has to wear. Some of the other tasks would include count how many trees are in the park and get a picture with a ground hog statue, get a picture of you guys doing the YMCA in front of "The Golden Arches" = McDonolds I was also going to have a challenge of getting signatures from three random people or pictures with three random people. Do you think this sounds fun does anyone else have any ideas? This would be  a race and after the last task is done they will get their team flag and must go back to the house and tie their team flag to a stick in the yard and report the items and info to another adult who will be inside she will then determine if they got all the items, pictures and info if so that team will be the winners and recieve huge chocolate bars I will have a $5.00 hinden in one of the wrappers for another suprise. If they do not have all the items and the other team comes after but has all the items the other team will still win. The losing team will get mini choclate bars.       Also I need Riddles for These Places      County Market (Local Grocery store)   Park/Town Square   Movie Gallery   Dollar Tree   Chinesse Resturaunt (China Wok)      Some other places we have in town that I couldn't think of anything to do with   Domino's    Fox's Pizza   Pizza Hut   Rosemens Florist   Places to get Hair Cut   Sheetz (Gas Station)   Wal-Mart   Shoe Show   Fashion Bug   Trackter Supply

The fact that i'm biting into flesh which i have myself, into an animal which once saw the world like me disgusts me, I can't bring myself to eat meat, i find it completely repulsive to smell, see, touch... But I'm having some health problems with low iron, and my parents are at me again to start eating meat. And not in the gentle "why don't you try this" way, they're thinking of force feeding me. they think i'm doing this just too wind them up, which I have no intention of doing, it's just that I cant bring myself to eat meat, this fear... Now they've come to a point where they said that they don't care less if i get sick, if i continue not eating meat. how can i explain that i'm not doing this out of spite, and that it's not something I can change, that being vegetarian is a healthy option when being careful, that i'm not the weird idiot that they tell me I am for not eating meat.   i'm 16
