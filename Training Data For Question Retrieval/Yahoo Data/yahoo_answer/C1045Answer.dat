b2qdwABVaa	The way you describe it makes it sound like the offensive player was trying to hurt the defensive player.  In reality, the offensive player is probably doing the smart thing, by getting his body in contact with the defensive player, otherwise known as "jumping into the defender" for a layup to draw the foul, and to prevent the defensive player from gaining a good position to block the ball away.<br>  <br>  Could it be a charge/offensive foul?  Possibly, but I would have to see the replay of it to determine it.
QC2NozBkaa	Que?|`|AA12034449	any bears are great. I just hate it when I stumble up on one...and it tries to eat me.<br>  <br>  work on your question asking skills.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	Grizzly bears are animals, not a process. They don't have negative or positive outcomes. Having too many or too few of them does affect the environment and the food chain though. <br>  <br>  What is "scenic value"? Bears are pretty, but don't get too close. Please rephrase your question using proper English and we can give you an answer.|`|LWzrCu5caa	It seems that with the warming climate, the Grizzly bears are moving north.  That is detrimental to the Polar bear population as the Grizzly take over the land territory of the Polar bears.  <br>  <br>  Also, there has already been one recorded kill of a Polar-grizz hybrid.  If that keeps up,  the Polar bear will quickly die out even if fully protected.  (I doubt Grizzly bears will care than the Polar bears are protected during mating season.)<br>  <br>  Lastly,  with the warming climate there is more food available in the winter.  Some of the bears in the Tahoe region of Nevada and California skip hibernating in the winter.  That leads to very unexpected interactions between people and bears in the winter.  If the Grizzly bears start doing the same,  it will make winter very interesting to say the least.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	as with all wild things bears require managed harvest.  Grizzlies in areas of Wyoming and Montana and elsewhere are encroaching on areas that are ranch lands, and predating on livestock. In one particular area south east of Cody, rogue bears from Yellowstone are deposited in a wilderness area and predation on spring calf crop is becoming much more apparent.  Same holds true of wolves. The value of grizzly and wolves as apex predators, without management of the species the population would expand to the point where to cost to livestock and game species would be such that revenues for ranchers would impossible for small ranchers to stay in business. <br>  <br>  "scenic value" is an intangle, we live in a tangible society.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Look the bears might be pretty but Grizzly Bears are extremely dangerous. In some parts of the country I would not go afield without a gun of some sort. You see when you introduce an Apex predator you lower our place on the food chain and people will get hurt.|`|Q3yGFnnnaa	Honestly, I have no idea what you're trying to ask, but I'll try to give an answer anyway.  Grizzly bears have little negative impact on the world around them.  The main problem that people have with them is that they are ill-tempered and prone to attack with little or no warning.  Other than that, they can be wonderful scavengers and are a valuable asset to the ecosystem.
bej55wxUaa	Funny how it's perfectly acceptable for Celtic to retain their Irish roots, (as they were set up as means of helping the poor IRISH immigrants of ALL denominations by Irish clergymen, who happened to be Catholics, NOT as a result of any discrimination, as some bigoted ignoramus may claim), yet Rangers get slated for doing likewise ?  Rangers are a Scottish team, and as such are part of Great Britain.  Most of Rangers fans are loyal to their Monarch and country.  In any other country they would be called patriots.<br>  <br>  Rangers had a Dutch manager, a Dutch assistant manager, several coaches and playing staff.  They introduced an orange top, the colours of Holland.  There is nothing to stop the club having an orange strip now or at any time in the past.  Why, in 136 years, have the club not done so more often ?  Some see that as something more sinister, yet do not question the lack of the Union flag at Parkhead, or the presence of an Irish tricolour.....hmmmmmm.  Double standards, in the extreme.|`|m2zXOREJaa	I could imagine BB with an ROI kit on as am sure with those <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0FP1Y7Cuq0&feature=related,she's" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0FP1Y7Cu...</a> like a little leprechaun.lol|`|bTNxl0ohaa	I sincerley hope they sell Union flags too as they are a British team in Great Britain.|`|c8DjmWXxaa	them pound shops will always stock ROI stuff.|`|nH4TOhGVaa	lol lets have a laugh tonight not a fight  BB|`|jOOyRJR2aa	The club was founded in Irish traditions for irish immigrants being discriminated against, in Scotland. <br>  What's wrong with selling "stuff" to celebrate your history?<br>  <br>  Could you please explain why rangers brought out an orange strip and urged every fan to wear it at the cup final?

0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	I can understand from an outsiders point of view, why you might believe Abreu has more value. However; as a Phillies fan who has seen him for years, he's a dog. He hits terribly with runners in scoring position, is a liability in the field, takes an excessive amount of called third strikes looking, and enjoys padding his stats when they game is already decided. That is the real Bobby Abreu.|`|yk4S7uuraa	I think if he would have taken the Yankees' offer, he would have gotten more. Thats what happens when you get greedy.|`|qivUrJ3Naa	Honestly nothing.  Abreu is still a quality outfielder with at least 2 more years left to produce.|`|4cJuKxJbaa	Actually early on before the market took a crap the Yankees were interested in re-signing him, just for a lot less than the $16m he made last year. Once Abreu said he had no interest in making less money the Yankees moved on! He is an excelent player & I truly belive that he is going to be missed very much in Yankee Land. I was puzzled all year also as to why teams werent ligning up to sign him. The Angels got a steal for the money they paid. It is true he wont hit you 30+ homeruns anymore but he will get plently of extra base hits, walk 100+ times, Score you a mess of runs, steal a base when he needs to, knock in 100 runs. He is a solid middle of the order guy, just not a big power threat. The market being so down is the only reason why he didnt get good money. He initially was looking for 2-3 years @ $16m+ per year, & that didnt work out so well!|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	Right now he's pretty much just a victim of the current baseball economy, much like Orlando Hudson.<br>  <br>  Over his career, I consider Abreu to be a "high-end" version of Reggie Sanders or Juan Encarnacion.  These are guys with obvious talent, but for whatever reason aren't "The Guy" you want to anchor your lineup.  Their talent makes them "in demand" to other teams looking to add a very good complimentary bat, but the fact that they aren't a "lineup anchor" like an A-Rod or a Manny also makes them expendable.<br>  <br>  The Phils had Utley and Howard so Abreu's projected salary was seen as "expendable."  The Yankees were looking for upgrades elsewhere, so again, he was the expendable one.|`|wmYnJd2jaa	Two things are working against and there may be a third thing we should not speak of.<br>  <br>  1) He's 35 years old, and was slowing down last year (fairly big drop in stolen base %)<br>  2) The economic meltdown - teams are just not sure what their revenue streams will look like going forward<br>  3) sshhh....collusion. Too early to say for sure, especially with the possible effect of point #2 - could it be that baseball owners are finally making sound financial decisions all on their own (except in New York) or is it a little collective action being taken by the owners? (If the players can act collectively, what's so wrong with the owners doing the same?)<br>  <br>  And finally, I've heard rumours that Abreu isnt' the best teammate. Completely unsubstantiated, and I've also the opposite. No way to know for sure without being in the clubhouse.|`|c6q3EERdaa	He's 34 years old, and he hasn't been the same since the 2005 Home Run Derby. He's getting to the age where retirement is a possibility, and teams would rather have young outfielders than ones who are winding down in their careers. I was surprised that the deal was only worth $5 million - I expected about $10 million - and the Angels were a surprise team for him to go to.
KZsdVGJzaa	it's really hard numbers aren't everything. Michael Vick was a better player coming out of College #1 overall. but Pat White is the only QB in college football history that went to 4 bowl games and has NEVER lost|`|UgnMjtYDaa	He's fast but he looks a little small.

KDOIKIq2aa	I think your over thinking the range issue.  You shouldn't be worried about how far you can shoot before hunting, but keep your shots to where the game is in a range you can hit.  If your constant at 40 yards with your hunting set up, ie broad head arrow in place of a target arrow, your good to go.  Most archery hunters I know consider a 40 yard shot a long shot.|`|QrjuueMCaa	You are plenty ready to go hunting. When I work with my sons, I try to have them nail 20 yard shots. Once they do that, they are good in most of the stands we hunt out of.<br>  <br>  It's judging distances that is the real problem people have. For the first year hunters I hunt with, I mark certain trees for yardage so they have reference points to refer to.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you! You are well on your way.|`|AA12034449	I'd think 9 of ten in your games kill zone at 25 yards would be good enough. Todays bows and arrowheads will do the job if you do yours.<br>  <br>  If you hunt off a stand, cammo up and have some skills that seems to be an average distance.<br>  <br>  I gun hunt.. dont cammo up, dont buy doe urine or any other do-dads and have never killed a deer farther than 40 yards...most have been closer|`|SkN2NqpGaa	Ok, so you can "cluster" your shots at 40-50 yards. So could I, less than a year after getting into archery.....a 10-15 inch "cluster". The real question should be "How tight a group should I be able to put my arrows in before I am ready to bowhunt?" It doesn't matter one bit how far away the deer is if you can't hit it.<br>  <br>  When you can put ten out of ten arrows into a 5-inch (maximum) circle at "X" yardage, then you are ready to go out and bowhunt at that yardage. When you can do it at 20 yards, then take shots at 20 yards. When you can do it at 30 yards, take shots at 30 yards. If you **can not** do it at 40 or 50 (or 60 or 70, etc) yards, you have no business taking shots at those yardages.<br>  <br>  It ain't about how far you should be able to shoot accurately. It's about not taking the shot when you are not sure of your accuracy.|`|0TuWYaneaa	You can adjust the height on your target to get an accurate idea of a longer range in a 50 yard range.Using the longer range sight aim at center and it should land higher on the target.You can put up targets that have yardage lines to tell what range your in.If you can hit a target repeatedly in 50 yards you should be okay.Just remember what the sight range is for.|`|AA10259042	40-50 yards is about the maximum range within a wooded area.  Most bow hunters hunt from a tree stand in a wooded area.  Even gun hunters infrequently get a shot within a wooded area beyond 50 yards.  If you are hunting on the plains, it would be better to use a rifle.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* 35 to 40 yards is the Maximum shooting distance to attempt to Harvest Game with a Bow.*|`|ZDOUwJsbaa	If your shooting good groups at 40 or 50 yards your in good shape. In most tree stand and ground blind situations while bow hunting it's unlikely that you'll see too many shots over 20 or 30 yards. Im not sure how you plan to hunt but it may be helpful for you to practice in a hunting situation. Say if you are going to hunt from a tree stand set your stand up in a tree in your yard and practice at different yardages. Remember the 20 yard pin on your bow is going to hit differently at 20 yards depending on if your standing at the bottom of the tree or your 20 feet up in the tree.|`|UbBz9NGAaa	It all depends upon how confident you are and if you can shoot one shot like you do when you are practicing.  A good practice to get into is even on days you are not practicing, is to go out in the backyard with no warm up and just release one arrow.... just to see how you are shooting cold because you will most likely be sitting for sometime before that opportunity arrises.  It will usually end up in you shooting more than one if you are anythinglike me but just take those shots when you only have a few minutes to see how close they are witth a cold shoulder.  Another consideration in regards to distance is the weight you are pulling, but I wouldn't personally recomend taking a shot over 50.  Good Luck|`|tgROmqffaa	If the farthest shot you can pull off in your area is 40 yards you should be able to hit a target at that accurately.  If you go any farther than that you can become inaccurate and worse yet not have enough of power to take down your animal.  A really good shot is within 20 yards.|`|t6gGzUgiaa	I took my first elk as a novice bow hunter at 42yrds.  I was proficient at 20, questionable at 30, and miraculous at 40+ yards.  I missed twice before connecting with a rag horn who ran about 25yrds with his heart jellied from direct hit... one of the two I missed was a GIANT 360+ bull on the run - alas... the one that got away.<br>  <br>  if I had it to do over - i would have been proficient at 40 yards... that is a consistent pie plate.<br>  <br>  good luck to you!|`|Pwt8PXYqaa	a very good range to get the animal is 20 yards.  but if you get an animal at 30 or 40 yards and its not comin in any farther, take it.<br>  <br>  and dude, if your hitting the target consistantly at 40 yards, you are definately good to go out bow hunting.|`|Q3yGFnnnaa	30 yards is good enough.  If you can get consistent groups at 40 to 50 yards, you're set.  Keep practicing, though!|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Look anyone can hunt so long as they can group at a given range. Here is a rule of thumb, if I expect my target to be at 250 yards I practice at 500. So take your expected range and double it and practice to that distance. I am not a bowhunter, I prefer firearms for personal reasons. But I would say you are good to about 20-25 yards give or take. The most I have heard of ethical hunters taking game at is about 30 yards with 35 being the longest.

Nha8TUq7aa	While I agree the Lions have plenty of great players and that the team's losses are a group effort, I do not think they should draft a quarterback. They tried it with Joey Harrington, who was a great prospect, and he was still a pretty good quarterback with the Lions, but without an offensive line and good blocking, they still were one of the worst teams in the league. It won't matter who's behind center if they can't find some guys to block. And when you say that Harrison could "groom Calvin Johnson into becoming the great player he has potential to b" I think he's already proven he is one of the best receivers in the league. With all the problems at quarterback and a poor offensive line he still had a great season last year and I think could be the best receiver if the rest of the offense picked up slack. But I was hoping the Lions would win a game last year and I'm sure they'll win a couple this year.|`|KNTofuxMaa	And I believe that Bud Selig knew nothing about steroids in baseball.|`|LWtz8cGsaa	Yeah and I believe that the easter bunny will come this year.|`|q9D1mCJnaa	They need to rebuild there Offensive Line in this Draft with their first 3 picks.

I practice swimming all year round, but my coach says its alright if I miss practice as long as I'm staying active. If you join track you will probably have more success in distance or mid distance events like the mile and the 800 meter (half mile) because swimming is an aerobic exercise and jogging is too. But idk, you may be a sprinter. You won't know until you start track. I suggest if you do field events that you also do running events so you don't get out of shape. I try to make swimming once a week during track season that way I am still keeping the muscles in my arms active. Track should end sometime in May and then you can start your regular practice schedule for swimming to be ready for summer league. Also if you find you are a distance runner you could run cross country in the fall.|`|2U4U22cxaa	I would do swimming because its a great workout and you can't beat the fun you have on swim team.

They are not.  They may be slower to reload, and not quite as accurate at long distances, but they are very deadly.<br>  <br>  Just think of how many people someone like Jessie James or Billy the Kid killed using 'old fashioned guns'<br>  <br>  NOTE: I assume by 'eat' you are referring to suicide by shooting oneself in the head through the open mouth.|`|tuULGJS6aa	The Colt Patterson appeared in 1836 and was Samuel Colt's first model of revolver. Many of them were taken to Texas for the war for independence from Mexico. If you must have someone eat a revolver, please not such a rare and valuable one as the Paterson. Colt's second revolver was the 1847 Walker, and one sold at an auction for $920,000 recently. A Paterson could sell for a huge price too. A bigger revolver would have more potential for harm to the viscera. I don't see any appreciable difference in an 1836 and a 2009 revolver being eaten. The older one is made of weaker steel and rusts more, but it wouldn't be in the gastric organs long enough for that to make much difference. How do you plan to have someone eat such a gun? Trying to swallow it whole would choke a person. If you disassembled it, the frame is still too big to swallow. To eat it, you'd have to saw the large pieces into small ones that wouldn't choke a person. Men have eaten metal and survived, but the pieces have to be small enough to pass down the esophagus. I certainly recognize the gun. I've seen them in a few movies, e.g. "Hawken's Breed' starring Peter Fonda, Serena Heddin and Jack Elam.|`|nBUDjyhgaa	It would likely open their head like a melon|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	You mean literally eat gun or shoot himself? Colt "Patterson" make several calibers, most common .36 similar modern .38 Special, Patterson mostly use round lead ball over black powder, have conical bullets too. My lover have Colt "Navy" .36, probably similar power of Patterson, seem similar some standard .38 Special loads, not +P. Modern .357 Magnum much more powerful, cause more damage shoot man. Some Patterson .40, no similar revolver now, .40 S&W semi-auto however, 10mm Auto more powerful, .41 Magnum revolver much more powerful. Also .44, .454, .475, .480, .500 Magnums, very powerful.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Eat it?<br>  A bigger one? Like what? A rifle, perhaps?|`|Q3yGFnnnaa	I don't like to eat guns, they're really not all that tasty.  Too much metal!
0Dm3WEMcaa	You know i never thought about it but yeah i think it was just like the general manager, run the show and made matches but still answered Vince and the board.|`|f3AdydqAaa	Yes it is like the general manager but has a little more responsiblity|`|mJvZhdAuaa	The commissioner was something like Jim Cornette is in TNA, so, yes, the commissioner was basically the general manager but since WWE only had Raw at the time, they didn't need actual GMs for different shows.|`|1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	It is exactly like a General Manager.  Same duties and responsibilities.<br>  <br>  "Commissioner" was just the first name for that job.  They changed it to "General Manager" a few years ago.|`|xZVmvgtHaa	actually yes thats exactly wat it is....there were 3 commisioners besides foley there was William regal, HBK, and Sgt Slaughter then in 2002 after the brand extension draft they became know as GM's with Eric Bischoff Becoming Raws gm and Stephanie Mcmahon becoming Smackdowns|`|43f9Ctozaa	Yes
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	For sure as i'd rather see Jim Cornette instead as co-commentator with Mike Tenay.He's far more talented,charismatic and gifted on the mic and would make Impact more entertaining and informative than Don West ever could.|`|AA11482019	Yes I am.  Don West sucks.  I hope he's gone for good.|`|UWJinEbIaa	YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING!  Get rid of Tenay he has never ever been good as a heel announcer, EVER!   I would rather have Jim Cornette and Jeff Jarrett as the announcer than suffer through another heel turn from Tenay.
wAiQOP0Laa	I just asked this question.  Either you read my answer on another question, or we are just on the same wavelength.  That's crazy, the same wording and everything.<br>  <br>  I think it would be great personally.  I think HBK could really bring Morrison up to the main event level and help Morrison began to establish his own legacy in the business.|`|CQKUqzaFaa	Yes I'd like to see it, Morrison is in line for a legit singles Push.|`|xZVmvgtHaa	it would make for excellent matches but not good storylines|`|TzCu3igraa	yeah, but it's been done with Y2J|`|Pvgzw1bIaa	Sure what would it be about.  Benjamin and Kofi had a feud, but it wasn't about anything.  So what's the storyline, like a Michaels - Jericho type feud, 'this has been eating Jericho since he was a kid' or Michaels - Batista type feud, 'you lied to me, now I'm going to hurt you.'  Which is crazy because it was initially over retiring Ric Flair, and it being personal, but now their friends.

ZAh8CEoGaa	Maybe he does.|`|21J0IIZbaa	Shaq knows the Lakers are the best team for him to win another title.|`|2kgTdNRQaa	It does seem like it.  But Shaq will never return to the Lakers for one simple reason:  as long as my man is there, Shaq won't be welcome.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	I think Shaq just wants everybody to like him when he runs for public office someday. Shaq's days are numbered, and I can't see the Lakers picking up that fat contract of his.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I agree but it better be next season because Shaq's career is  out of gas and he won't make it past next year in my opinion.|`|VNpZPjZ3aa	Shaq don't know what he wants to do when he grows up...I think|`|G6KNZIVTaa	It sure seems like it. He's been kissing *** with the Laker management, Kobe, and Phil all season. But I don't think the Lakers will ever trade for Shaq. They're doing well without Bynum, so why do they need another center.<br>  <br>  But who knows, maybe in 2 years when his contract expires, he'll sign with the Lakers. Knowing Kupchak, he'll probably do it.|`|1q0onMQtaa	iunno, but that would be kool <_<.<br>  <br>  Shaq should retire as a Laker.|`|EImm4teRaa	Lakers would never take him with Gasol, Bynum and Odom. <br>  <br>  But you are right.

b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	Two major differences.  Bonds lied to a Grand Jury about his involvement with drugs, and there is evidence he used these drugs after the implementation of the MLB/Players Union drug program.  On the other hand, A-Rod never lied to a Grand Jury and there is no evidence he used any banned drugs after the implementation of the drug program.  The situation involving A-rod, and the use of drugs, is more closely aligned with the Andy Pettitte situation than with Bonds.|`|4V6V9uN8aa	David C., sorry, but you are way wrong!!!  Steroids has been banned for decades, before Bonds or A-Rod were even out of junior high.  The reason people are tripping on Bonds as to virtually giving A-Rod a pass is that with Bonds, he broke one of baseballs most prestigious records - Hank Aaron's Home Run record, while steadfastly talking to the public denying he ever used any form of chemical enhancement.  Then, he gets in front of a jury in court & steadily denies the same thing.  He's in the newspapers, on tv, giving interviews denying the use of steroids or anything.  Then, he turns around & tells that he was in fact using a chemical enhancer that he states he "didn't know" was an illegal substance, as his trainer was giving it to him.  Is there ANYONE of us that would let someone INJECT us with something & not know what it was??  How stupid can you be..<br>  <br>  With Alex, he came out & admitted to what he did.  Still, his was 6 years ago, not just last season, & he has tested clean ever since the '03 season ( as far as we know..).  Still, Alex did not lie to the public, perjure himself in court, cheat to break a record, & he stopped (as far as we know..) before it got out of control.  With Alex, he still will be looked down on to a point, but his situation is forgivable.  With Bonds, he did something that not only tainted the sport, but athleteics in general & how do we look at the record books now?  I wish there was a way of erasing his home-runs from the books & giving the record back to Aaron, but that wouldn't mean anything to anyone...|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Because, ARod at LEAST admitted to doing it...late and after the fact, but at least he's not DENYING it anymore...like Barry...|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Not a clue. I will say using steriods is illegal. Not illegal for frofeesion sports but illegal as a criminal offense that will get a person jailtime. That's the case unless your ich and famous, then it's not illegal even when testifying before congress. This is why I don't watch professional sports, becuase the law seemingly doesn't apply to people getting contracts for hundreds of millions of dollars while people starve to death in the streets.|`|2wgEsVmsaa	First, people seemed pretty steamed to me. Second, at least A-Rod admitted it. Barry Bonds still insists we bow down to him. And, finally, people are really punched out with steroids. Baseball seems to be the last thing baseball is about. Steroids, money, conservative billionaires -- where is the GAME anymore?|`|5xIroQjMaa	First off, the Arod stuff is just starting to  build up. We've had years of Barry, and he was hated already, so it added fuel to the fire. Even though it appears he was innocent of perjury (according to all the evidence and testimony), people still presume him guilty. <br>  <br>  Trust me, once more truth comes out about Arod (because I hope no one buys his cousin story), they'll see how many lies he's wrapped himself in, and things will come tumbling down. The more home runs he hits, the more scrutiny will be there, until he comes tumbling down.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	This must be your first day in this group.|`|jhNUuz0maa	I think its because Bonds is a record holder, however, I am so tired of hearing about this. Test everyone for steroids. Those who test positive, punish them. Conduct random tests and those who test positive cannot play for a year. Then, if they test positive again after that year, they will be suspended for two more years. Meanwhile, all that money they were supposed to make goes back to the owners. The players can't follow rules, they shouldn't be paid either.<br>  The idiots who lied to congress should spend a year or two in jail. <br>  Problem solved. If they want to do the steroids, then they should be not allowed to play.|`|obPSaYf3aa	Because Barry Bonds is the all-time leader in HR's for season and career, his attitude towards the media is unfriendly because they always slander him and because Alex Rodriguez has not broken any statistical records for him to always be under the microscope.<br>  <br>  MLB decided to use Barry Bonds as its scapegoat just because he's high profile, even though there are 100's of other players that had used PED's.  The media tends to use him as their punching bag just because he did not grant easy interviews or photo ops to reporters early in his career and was branded "a jerk" by the media, then the public just believed those lies.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	I don't think you've been paying much attention lately.  A-Rod is catching all kinds of hell over this.<br>  <br>  Another big difference is Bonds more than likely lied  under oath.  A-Rod hasn't done that, or at least it hasn't been reported.|`|fKAnnQeWaa	Where were you a couple of weeks ago?<br>  <br>  The case with Bonds is that he continues to deny his usage of PED's while Alex admitted to them. Everybody likes the truthful guy better than the liar.|`|NQBtZkeoaa	For better or worse we're desensitized to it. Literally a lot of people don't care anymore.|`|4UilmYwKaa	because barry lied about using them and he broke several records.|`|AYiVipawaa	He admitted, and he's not the hr leader|`|dYw7zWfyaa	Because Barry Bonds is arguably the most hateful athleteof our generation. The article sums him up:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/magazine/life_of_reilly/news/2001/08/21/life_of_reilly/" rel="nofollow">http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_...</a><br>  <br>  It is rare to come across an athelete who was as self absorbed as Barry.<br>  <br>  While A'Roid isn't exactly a poster child for role models, he isn't in the same leage as Barry.|`|Ry77jN0qaa	because Barry lied and didnt apologize for taking them, A-Rod came right out an apologized. Another thing is because Barry is the homerun king and alot of people hate him for that.|`|GW2HHBw9aa	The media never liked Barry Bonds so they took every opportunity to attack him. However, I think it is also an issue of race. Roger Clemens has never been attacked the same way Bonds was even though he is clearly as guilty.|`|LnB9U8Fbaa	because the evidence obtained in A-Rod's case was illegally obtained and may not be even worth anything in the court of law, a-rod might walk with nothing.|`|3b19545514d9f2ad32a6ef7b4dca83acaa	A-Rod's use was a long time ago and he didn't lie to whoever - Bonds used while he was going for the home run thing and he lied, lied, lied|`|GrgXutMsaa	Because A-Rod didn't perjure himself.|`|GsSRY7quaa	because A-rod admitted his usage. and at the time it wasn't banned in baseball like it is now.
PTWnWkPRaa	You should maybe run around your neighborhood to get ready for track. Work on sprints and work on lifting weights (not too heavy that you will hurt yourself). I did track and i enjoyed doing hurtles. I did track in 6th grade and my coach thought i was a taller bigger girl and he was wrong. I was stuck doing shot put, it was alright. Just get used to running and doing track, so if your going to do track next year you can know what you are going to expect. Go for it try it<br>  Good luck<br>  Have Fun!!! :)|`|fbMdbMIEaa	I think that the best events for you, and someone your size, would be: 10k, shot put and discus (like you said) and maybe even polvolt. What I would work on are abs, leg muscles (especially the quadriceps) and your bicep/ tricep muscles.|`|kW6vXLW3aa	cross country which is LONG running is a good thing to join once you find out if you like track or not.track is similar,but shorter distance and more different events like hurdles or 300 meter run and so on.|`|AA10404797	you should work on your abs and technique because that is what helps the most.|`|9BEnnPhOaa	lol i'm a 13 year old girl to 5 ft. 3 inch. 100 lb.! This year is going to be my first time to! I think that running is a very strong category in field in track. Also, do whatever you want! If you are very good runner go for short distance since you don't want to go long and get a membership at a nearby gym to run on a treadmill or something. If you want to go shot put or discus you should get your upper body in shape by doing push ups and weight machines. Altogether though just be brave and outgoing. You will probably be good at whatever you do! Good luck! :)
AA10241450	Actually that's one of the best workouts to improve your sprinting is jogging the curves or walking and sprinting the straight aways.  Also mix it up with 200 meters - you can walk since you should have fully recoveries for maximum results.  My favorite workouts is running speedplays on XC courses where the varied terrain can be hilly.  Sprinting on slight declines can also help since your have gravity assisting you.  Also do resistance training and work you abs.  Good luck!|`|AA10404797	stamina and self discipline, the harder you go the better you get at both running and the easier your practice gets.|`|IExXmir1aa	You have to keep a routine of running. For example, run for two or 3 days and then rest one day. And believe it or not but running backwards really helps your leg muscles, witch improves your speed. Try running 1 or 2 lap backwards and you'll feel your leg muscles like crazy.
1UID5JtNaa	If you skipped rope for 30-40 minutes a day for a few months, you'll improve your aerobic capacity and run better than if you did nothing at all, however, to run well you need to run.  It's called specificity of training.|`|zMSWGHgYaa	not really and it depends on what ur gonna b running [long or short distance] it wont help u either way tho cuz u need to gain endurance in long distance and short distance moslty requires speed so go a nearby track and start doing ur workouts there|`|WUc9TbHCaa	Yes.

The match was originally supposed to be a non title match, there was also supposed to be a promo by jbl before the match. However, the script for this segment was leaked (you can find it under my other questions, i posted it). so to spite the IWC Vince had it changed.

The only thing that made Chyna successful was her brute strength and size.|`|tuwHboNnaa	Victoria is a much better wrestler.

She should have moved onto TNA years ago.|`|8h5dqzf6aa	They were both very good and talented but I will give a slight edge to chyna|`|XEGBUFwAaa	Victoria is a better wrestler than Chyna is. Chyna just had sheer size and hit a couple of back-flips every now and then. Chyna may have beaten Victoria in the area of strength but Victoria wins in speed, athleticism, & skill.|`|IVEdWA2uaa	Chyna wasnt a good wrestler because of skills..it was her MANLY size..i still cant tell if she a woman.<br>  <br>  Victoria by far is way better|`|jTpWbgzFaa	Victoria is the better wrestler by far.|`|ZYcnknwsaa	chyna
AA12172407	What a morbid topic...hehehe<br>  <br>  When I was a kid, in 1978, a bunch of Bruins games were cancelled due to the crazy blizzard we got. I was so bummed the trains weren't running and the roads were covered...8 years old and crazy hockey kid. We had like 6 feet of snow, no joke, and all I wanted was a B's game!|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	That stinks about missing the game!  <br>  <br>  A guy on my old team missed two games in 1998 (he was living in Quebec at the time) when they had their horrible ice storm.<br>  <br>  Touch wood, no disasters yet (good for me in that I'm the goaltender and we don't have a backup).|`|G33E41IBaa	The worst that's ever happened to me was a huge snow storm up in New Jersey.  I know, it's lame haha.|`|AA11674745	To be honest, I never played in an organized ICE hockey league long enough to even miss a game. When I started moving all around the country I stopped playing sports on a regular basis just when ice leagues began to proliferate in the Philadelphia region. <br>  <br>  I did however, compete in several organized STREET hockey leagues before then (I established a short-lived one) and I did miss a game due to work responsibilities on several occasions.<br>  <br>  That was because I started to work while still in high school and once I turned 18, the premium (night) shifts were attractive to me because there were no bosses (except me) and the pay was better than day shift.<br>  <br>  Incidently, that particular company was located where our new soccer team (MLS Philadelphia 2010) will play.|`|8yhIsQr4aa	i dont post a whole crap load but i do atleast no kimmy plays hockey ok so anyway i missed a game one time when i was 9 due to snow we couldt even take the public tranportation bus can u imagine me n my dad on the public bus with hockey bags everywhere! hahaa i was bummed granted they ended up cancelling the game anyway but i really wanted to be there|`|UIcItboeaa	I'm sorry you missed your game and I'm sorry some random loser had to find your question. I can't recall ever missing going to watch a game because of the weather and it would take some kind of fire and brimstone to shut a game down in Buffalo. I don't even mean that in the hard *** way, I mean, people here are used to below zero weather and crazy fast wind, nothing closes in 3 feet of snow, so its kind of the nature of the Buffalo Beast. Course, I don't know what we'd do if there was like...um...an earthquake or soemthing, last time we had a fault line split here most people didn't even realize it.|`|ULw1777caa	Most of us know you play hockey?  I don't even know who you are.<br>  <br>  Nope, never missed anything important because of a disaster.  I guess I've been lucky that way.|`|axxQzOCHaa	I wanted to go to the arena last year and blow off some steam, but Hurricane Donna was in town so state and local officials ordered us to stay inside. <br>  <br>  It was my first hurricane experience so the 80mph winds were a bit intimindating to me.<br>  <br>  I don't think anyone will be able to beat Spaceboy's answer. <br>  <br>  We've all been kids, and the mention of 6 ft of snow makes me nostalgic for the stuff.<br>  <br>  -------<br>  hi Leafsfan: I remember that ice storm (<< tempette de verglas >> in french) very well. <br>  Had flown back in from my brother's wedding near Mexico City the night before. I was studying at UQTR that year.

ePvvGUu3aa	WQ ~ Both Shawn and Undertaker are already established legends in the WWE. I think this match will be the icing on the cake of their legendary careers. I'm sure everyone can agree that these two are already legends and will be in the Hall of Fame in the near future. The two best collide at WrestleMania to cement their legacy in the WWE. That's how I see it.<br>  <br>  BQ ~ I'm thinking it will most likely be Trish Stratus, if not then I can see this going to either Melina or Beth Phoenix. <br>  <br>  BQ#2 ~ It was probably something he always wanted to look into after a wrestling career or earlier in his life. In my opinion, he's sold out events already in the past, so to me there is nothing left to prove really. I believe he's doing what he thinks is best for him. Honestly, I would want to see him back, but that's going to be an unlikely chance.|`|kGCd8ioRaa	Undertaker 17 - 0|`|klumbdSFaa	no matter who comes out the winner, hbk will always be mr. wrestlemania.. and undertaker will always be remembered for his streak.<br>  <br>  bq: probably mickie james or beth phoenix<br>  bq2: wrestling was in his blood, and he grew up with it, so it most likely seemed as if that was the only career for him (and he was probably pressured into it too, since his dad & grandfather were such great wrestlers). it just turned out that wrestling wasnt the career for him, and its good that he went after his dreams.. not what everyone wanted him to be -- no matter how good he is.|`|wEST8CCUaa	I think The Undertaker might keep the streak in tact<br>  <br>  I think it might be Trish Stratus if it's going to be someone from the past, if it's going to be someone current I'll go with Beth Pheonix because they might want to build her up even more<br>  <br>  I think the Rock went with movies because of the money and the physical toll it took on his body. Overall though I don't think the Rock really loved wrestling as much as others, because he would do movies as a side project while still wrestling.|`|rVmPQO2Uaa	Taker deserves more respect even though Shwan entertains more.<br>  <br>  All I'm saying is that Melina better F****** be Miss Wrestlemania!!!How can this stupid wwe make her loose to a W**** like Maryse on her Birthday!I swear if Melina loses to some old hag or even worse,maryse,I will be very very pissed!<br>  <br>  The rock is a total sell out.He could care less about his wrestling career now.He only wants money.He's selfish and his movies are rather tasteless.|`|d2OLxA72aa	Disney movies pay very well- The Rock could have been the Next Action Star, but choose to do pg movies.<br>  <br>  Sunny will win.<br>  <br>  Taker 17-0

BPDvvryraa	I played a course for the 1st time in a tournament.  It was a pretty tight course, with little space between holes.  I teed off and hit what I thought was a great drive.  Got up and hit my second shot about 8 ft so I was feeling pretty good up until the rules official came over to instruct me that I knocked it onto the 8th green.  Took my double and for some reason I could never get my composure back.|`|GtLPp5dgaa	i was at the marine base playing there golf course in ocean side and everybody was watching and the parking lot is on my right side and i hit it straight right and it hits a car and all i hear is that better not be my car or your A$$ is getting kicked|`|d7gyGbF4aa	I killed a child with the golfball.|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	My ball hit the green keeper's brick shed, and bounced around his things before rolling so a tree blocked the green.<br>  The ball was damaged and had tar on it, and the other players refused to let me replace it ... i had tar on my club head after that.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	I hit one way right.  There were OB stakes over there.  I would have had a great shot to the green but I assumed I was OB.  So I walked back to the tee and made double.  I found out after the round that the OB applied only to the 9th hole.|`|sSgTuD5Vaa	Haha oh it was so funny. Embarrassing too. I took all my practice swings and everything and I was all geared up to hit the shot. I swing the club but I don't feel the impact of the ball. I ended up hitting the tee instead of the ball so the ball is in the same position it was before... just not on the tee. <br>  <br>  Another time there was this set of bushes in front of the first tee and a ridiculously large gallery of people behind me. I was nervous. Shot number one= topped and lost in the bushes. Shot number two= topped and lost in the bushes. Shot number three= topped and lost in the bushes. Finally I was just so completely fed up with it that I was aiming diagonally away from the bushes... it worked though. I topped it in the fairway :P<br>  <br>  Good times :)|`|prahKrpjaa	I'll answer, but you MUST focus on the positive, and not listen to these stories!  Also, your nerves will calm down the more you play in tournaments, and realize that everyone else is in the same boat as you.<br>  <br>  In addition, you might want to play it a little more safe on the first tee if your nerves are kicking in.  Hit your 3 wood instead of a driver.<br>  <br>  Anyway, 2007, I was going through major swing changes.  I had no idea where the ball was going.  Somehow I managed to qualify for the Michigan Net Amateur.  I usually don't because it's tough to beat a 15 handicap who shoots 78 when you're a 4 handicap shooting 78 (cough)....<br>  <br>  So first hole, OB left, pretty far left, wide open space to the right.  I had very little confidence off the tee and absolutely smother hooked one, heading towards OB.  For the grace of God, the houses on the left were a new development, and they had that black plastic stuff staked up all along the left hand side, about 1 foot high.  My ball dives right into the plastic about 150 yards off the tee, bounces off into the rough, in bounds.  <br>  <br>  I manage to "save" a bogey out of that, and actually played decent the rest of the way.<br>  <br>  The next day, I smoked a drive on that hole, hit a 5 iron to about 8 feet, and made birdie... so, you never know!|`|t3rmVomeaa	First ever J-V tourney my freshman year in high school.  Shotgun start, and I got sent to the 13th tee.  Pretty good starting hole.  Easy drive and approach as long as you are able to avoid the fairway bunkers about 280 off the tee.  There is a creek that runs through the 14th fairway and meanders its way right in front of the tee box on 13.  I had a 3 wood, trying to avoid the bunkers.  I never considered the creek right in front of the tee box, and of course, I cold topped it right into the creek. <br>  <br>  Not the start of my high school playing career that I was looking for.  Funny thing is Ive played that hole at least a 1000 times, and that is the only time I ever put it in that creek.  Funny what pressure will do to ya huh?|`|gAhHCpRNaa	i topped it on the first hole with a big gallery. it was the final round of the state championship i was in the last group only 2 off the lead. it wasnt the start i wanted.

I recently bought a Tommy Gun from Kahr.  It has been back to the factory twice now, and still isn't working right.  That really sucks when you shell out almost $1,000 for a new gun.  I'm lucky.  I bought it at Sportsman's Warehouse and they have offered to give me a refund.  I shudder at the thought that I might have bought it some where else.  They have also covered all of the shipping for the returns and everything.  Good luck on finding your m1 carbine.  You might try gunbroker.com.  You might also do well finding an m1 carbine and swapping the paratrooper stock on later.  I know I have seen the stocks in a couple of catalogs lately.  I really hope you enjoy your new rifle more than I have mine.|`|AA10182211	You can get a great m-1 carbine from <a href="http://www.thecmp.org/m1carbine.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecmp.org/m1carbine.htm</a>  the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

DGVEjFyoaa	I'll be direct, I believe 56 years old is too old to get back in the ring.<br>  <br>  However, boxing in general, as a hobby or as a trainer etc you would still be fine.<br>  <br>  At 56 years old, I wouldn't recommend anyone to go back in the ring, especially if they have not been conditioning themselves daily/weekly since leaving the ring.<br>  <br>  As you get older, exercise is important to fight against the wear down of muscle and tissue, sports are done whilst young because their body is still capable of recovering easily from damage. <br>  <br>  Going back in the ring now has much higher risk, if you were to go back in the ring, worst case scenario is that you die, but more realistically, you may suffer an injury that you cannot recover from or recover completely from.<br>  <br>  I'd advise you to only go as far as a hobby in boxing if you were to continue no matter what. You can ask for sparring since you get headgear and matches can be easily controlled, but no more than that.<br>  <br>  Depending on what boxing you were talking about, it may also be difficult to find managers who are willing to invest their time. Put yourself in their shoes, this may be harsh but given the selection of boxers that they could choose, the younger boxers who exhibit potential are better.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	no  your not to old but why don't you try exhibition if you think you are moving and not getting tired then go ahead|`|abTZX46faa	If you want to do some boxing just as a hobby, just go and do it. You only get one life and you'll regret it when you really are too old (Imagine yourself at 65 thinking back to how you should have still done some boxing while you were still 56 and able to move well) if it is something you really wanted to do. Although, to be honest with you, I can't recommend you take part in matches, unless you can find a competition for your age group.|`|kX8e0ASEaa	Hey man if you are in shape go for it.  Boxing might be a little straining on the joints though if you have any problems, but I know many 60+ boxers who box so I don't see why you shouldn't especially if you are in good shape|`|Yrcf7HGAaa	Yes I think at 56 your too old.<br>  <br>  George Foreman was one of the oldest and now of course we have Bernard Hopkins at the age of 43 but 56 is pushing it.|`|lrJopeC5aa	Maybe you should worry about retirement instead.|`|2f0d8b0ba23a243ba5699d5b29e7002baa	i'd pay to see that.

AA11488609	Usually ESPN uses their poll, most other news outlets will use both unless it's the AP who will use their ranking.  They are considered equal ranking methods, but I'd like to say that the USA Today/ESPN Coaches' poll is more accurate because these are coaches voting on who the best teams are, not some journalist who likely may not have played any basketball in his or her life.  The AP rankings however tend to pick up who the better "mid-major" teams are, and more often than not, mid major teams are ranked more often in the AP, and higher than they do in the coaches rankings, as most of the coaches are from major conference programs.|`|zoDEqv6Zaa	I say it's both because they all count as the official polls. I guess each polls is either from a press writers or a coaches point of view, either one is good.|`|GERlmBIUaa	I would say ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll cuz every1 goes by that poll and it seems like the most accurate won... lets go UT and Georgetown...best answer plz|`|1P5qWMQ0aa	The AP poll.

euo0j3NTaa	No. But Kofi Kingston beats in the heck of Y2J Chris Jericho for the Intercontinental Championship last year in the history of the WWE. You know, quite frankly Kofi will be in the fatal four way match against Edge, The Big Show and John Cena at Wrestlemania 25 in Houston Texas, for the World Heavyweight Championship. Plus Kofi Kingston will be the next World Heavyweight Champion.|`|8pAjkFZJaa	Kofi will be good in money in the bank match.

"Vicki, you got some splainin to do!" classic. i think he will win the belt cause hes the only face in a match with two heels. it seems like a lot of rivalries will be settled at backlash.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	Normally I completely hate it when Cena goes out there.

AA11528760	Actually, it wasn't the first time that audience had seen him that night. These days ECW is taped before RAW. Christian recieved a great pop at the ECW taping that were done prior to the RAW Live taping. So, when he came for the 2nd time, on RAW, the crowd wasn't as excited as seeing him for the first time.<br>  See the crowd's reaction to Christian on ECW this week.|`|B9h6VhQOaa	i literally said that to myself. i was  so pissed i flipped off the tv. i know  that was probably overreacting but i just hated it. the fans don't understand that he's a good wrestler. they only like the wrestlers that get pushed down our throats.<br>  god damn kids|`|8h5dqzf6aa	yeah I know he got no pop at all it is just sad. it is probably because of the kids who care only about cena|`|WAGAcLPMaa	Christian has not been on RAW since 2005. Before tonight, he has only been seen on ECW, which doesn't get nearly the amount of viewers RAW or Smackdown does. To all newer casual fans, not just kids mind you, he is actually a new face, one that they'll just have to find more about.<br>  <br>  It's no different than when CM Punk or Evan Bourne made the trip from ECW to RAW. Hell, remember Chris Jericho's debut? That didn't get a gigantic reaction, and you can bet that it wasn't just kids who didn't know who Y2J was.<br>  <br>  Those guys didn't get much of a crowd reaction at first, it took time and exposure before they were accepted by the fans. Casual fans don't remember Christian, they don't watch TNA, they don't go on the Internet and look up every wrestler known to man. They only know what's put in front of them, and tonight, for many, was the first night they saw Christian. Give them some time to actually get to know or relearn about the guy.|`|IdYZAk2Baa	The kids Annoy beyond belief these days, if i didnt know a wrestler back then i would go on the internet and study them like crazy and learn to love them, these kids r just like so thick headed. I dont think they relize how good of a wrestler Christian really is, he needs to get some attention and those kids need to go on youtube and study him and learn to love him like i did with Jericho before he came back|`|SXRdNW80aa	He'll win Money In The Bank at WM. The WWE will then give Christian the WWE title on the Smackdown brand.|`|3o8jPdWQaa	Its because of the kids. they should make a no under 10 year old kid into a wwe show lol.|`|z6enccBKaa	well all the fan are little kids they dont no who he is|`|kH8Dt23Haa	Kids!!

The Randy Orton house thing was funny.|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	I agree, I think Christian is a great wrestler, but he does not get the crowd reaction that he deserves, the whole Big Show, Edge, and Vickie thing was hilarious. And the ending of RAW was awesome, great from start to finish. 10/10|`|5ce1a4e084303d0af7f28437324670a6aa	Oh, I don't know now. Orton jumped up a little to quick after going through a glass window and getting stole on a couple of times. Not good to me. He also should have gone to jail for hitting Hunter while the cops was arresting him. It's called obstruction of justice. It was intense but the ending of that segment was messed up.|`|Zgdf76apaa	Yes this was the best RAW of 2009 so far I would watch it again.|`|3i1vAIBFaa	best raw i've seen in a few years. good from start to finish.|`|3o8jPdWQaa	I liked the one when HHH chased Orton through the backstage of the arena, it was better but yea tonights was pretty good
AA10576425	Yes! I think the last segment was really good.. HHH throwing Orton out of the window was realistic.. The storyline is being worked out really well.. Cena's announcement was also good.. It was obvious though..

tzrLDbHWaa	Can't really blame them.  I mean, if they have a lot of ex-Steelers coaches, you have players going somewhere they feel comfortable, where they'll be coached by people they know and like.

The players leaving Arizona don't necessarily go to PItt because they've never been coached by the Steelers coaches before and because the Steelers don't usually bring it veteran free agents anyway.|`|khU8m4gxaa	Makes perfect sense. The players and coaches have a relationship going back to PIT, so when they become available they seek each other out. It happens everywhere. Think of all the ex-Cowboys now playing for the Dolphins since Parcells & Sporano came to Miami.
hMkb7H31aa	Richard "Stubby" Clapp, aka 'Stubby Dick', is a 37 year old MLB veteran who could be on the comeback trail.  With his performance on the Canadian team during the WBC,      the Yankees would be nuts to not at least give him a look-see.  <br>  <br>  A-Rod is down (and out?) and there is an APB for a qualified replacement. Yankee Super Scout, Gene Michaels, has been scouting the Stubster for the last several seasons, under the direction of The Boss.  No doubt Old George would like to make at least one decision this season - and bringing Stubby up from the depths would be gigantic.<br>  <br>  As long as Stubby doesn't have that weak Scott Boros negotiate for him, what is "just too much money" for the Yankees?  After all, Stubby has 25 at bats in the majors with the Cardinals - and he's not about to stop there.<br>  <br>  Imagine a Yanks-Cards World Series and Stubby is the MVP - that would make the Cardinals (even more) red with embarassment. <br>  <br>  Stubby will be signed before we know it.  But he should hold out a little to give his Manny impression.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stubby_Clapp" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stubby_Clap...</a>|`|2uINYiMfaa	I dont think so. There team is stacked right now.|`|qAVADb9vaa	Stubby Clapp? sounds like a fat STI lol|`|B46t8gkLaa	why would they need him?
xfRwel49aa	If your gun is in good condition i bet you could sell it for more than the $180 a brand new A5 costs try Ebay or Craigslist and try to sell your gun see what you can get or just bring straight to the paintball shop and talk to them|`|8ZARrsnXaa	try selling it if the store doesn't take it.
z7JsVzcnaa	Base ball is more popular, so it makes more money.  The TV contracts and the sponsorships are much larger for MLB, so they can play players a lot more.<br>  <br>  The NHL has pretty good fan attendance, but it does not generate the large ratings to warrant TV contracts that pay a lot of money to the NHL and then the teams.
uS8hK7Zhaa	Well you need to stop complaining then and enjoy it while it lasts|`|mVH5LqMuaa	it is beleave me ...someone is always getting arested before wrestlemania every year|`|EAZv468Xaa	well they do it every year. The storylines get better and better and better when it's wrestlemania time, but when wrestlemania is over it gets boring. I think we should just enjoy it while it last because I don't think the good stuff is gonna last long.|`|3o8jPdWQaa	I hope not i hope when the draft happens even more fueds happen that are "memerable" lets hope this wm will be a new beginning to the attitude era.|`|KWtjVW9saa	Im enjoying it because its just for a while.|`|8zwL5YwFaa	I Dont think HHH Or RKO, Will turn into A Sideshow for kids like cena|`|AP5bCHA3aa	Its always good like this around this time before Wrestlemania, just enjoy it wilst you can dude :(|`|TlsDoCOWaa	I would hope not. But most probably you're right. PLEASE! DEATH TO THE PG ERA!!!!

Now Gallo should get more playing time for him to develop, since the playoffs will be tough to reach.
yererDcnaa	i am going to go with choice number 2. <br>  <br>  the comeback from being down 0-3 to winning the series is a much bigger deal then beating a team in the superbowl that is playing for an undefeated season. the fact the red sox hadnt won a title in so long makes that victory much sweeter compared to beating a team trying to go for an undefeated football season (at least in my opinion)|`|RIJI7xSFaa	As a diehard Tribe fan #2. I experienced the Tribe choking in '07 and it still hurts. I'd give my right arm to see them win the WS|`|OXHLqBuwaa	choice 2 is much bigger of a deal and this is coming from THE BIGGEST YANKEE FAN.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	This really sounds like a NY / Boston question to me..<br>  <br>  16-0 is still a great record, but finally winning the world series would take the cake.. #2..|`|VRdxwKaQaa	Like the way I feel after a cup of coffee and a bagel..#2.

I'm really pulling for him to win in the match, but they probably wont let him. Then again CM Punk won last year and nobody expected it so i guess there is still a chance.|`|AWLTs23raa	That's awesome, but I would have liked to have waited to seem him win the match myself.|`|MaZ7zfiFaa	true very true i just checked my source and it is true oh and evan bourne returns next week|`|3o8jPdWQaa	You better not be lying lol, I hope he wins and claims the wwe title!|`|VlvektSJaa	Sounds great!<br>  I'm excited!!!!!|`|z6enccBKaa	christian vs edge backlash how dose that sound
khU8m4gxaa	I've felt for a long time that the WWE HOF has no credibility. Koko B. Ware was no more than glorified enhancement talent during his time in WWE. That's not an insult to him as a worker, but he never accomplished much of anything in the ring. No classic matches, no title runs of any kind. He was basically the '80's version of Charlie Haas. He was fun & a decent talent, but lost pretty much everytime. I don't get it. I thought Tony Atlas' induction was questionable, but this takes the cake. No Backlund, despite a 6 years reign as WWF Champion? No Savage? I know about the fued with him & Vince, but still. Koko Ware? Really?|`|e3m3rdNYaa	Koko brought humor to a very dry period, well deserved|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	He Served His Purpose during that Timeframe.<br>  But , They Are Running Out of People to Induct.<br>  <br>  HA - Don't be Surprised if the Brooklyn Brawler gets Inducted Next Year...|`|wEST8CCUaa	I think he might be one of those guys that don't really have the accomplishments but he has a name and gimick that made him famous.|`|52luRGoVaa	grand master sexay!|`|z6enccBKaa	why you say that because he black just playing i think the rock would had been better|`|5qqko0DOaa	I TOTALLY AGREE!!!! i don't think koko b. ware has ever won a major title.<br>  wwe is just feeling sorry for him
ZFTkBTvvaa	yes, it is with that "the are going to win by 50+ points"|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	i agree with what circle said, but to be honest, it happens at every laker home game. i noticed during when the lakers played vs the warriors at staples, the lakers got all the foul calls in the first 3 quarters, and they were leading by like 15. so its basically game right, so all the bench players go in, and then we get all the foul calls to make the game seem fair. be truthful, this happens in laker games a lot i know it does.|`|IUxM3brbaa	Refs put every important Laker player in foul trouble.<br>  <br>  Beginning of the 3rd: Lakers had 100% more fouls called on them. 100% more! Kobe has yet to shoot a free throw. Show me the last game that happened please.<br>  <br>  In that situation, Lakers cannot defend against anyone or they will foul out. This is the determining a game. The next 1.5 quarters don't matter. The refs then make the fouls look more balanced.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Only one loss big deal we still best in nba|`|Wclc7zRqaa	Reality Check time.  You really think you jinxed the Lakers?  You really believe you have that much power over an NBA team - or anything else?  Unless you found a way to slip barbiturates in their Gatorade, you had nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  The Lakers are a great team, but they do have off times.  Even when the true greats were still playing, they lost games.|`|6SsSjqFTaa	it's ok, the lakers OWNED the blazers during their 3-peat|`|u2QhQAxzaa	Whatever, we still will have home court throughout the playoffs, and Bynum will be back...I love how everyone has forgotten about our dominant center named Andrew Bynum.|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	Agree with first answerer, we're still the best after this loss... But now, it will be 6 wins and "26" losses for the Lakers against the Blazers in Portland since 1995.

We got to see a little new Era mixed with Attitude Era. It was a nice balance. Tonight's Raw was great.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	I give it a 10. I wish Triple H had abducted Orton's wife, that would have been the icing on the cake for me. But this ending was great|`|3i1vAIBFaa	9/10<br>  the only way it could have been better if orton would gotten arrested too. and if he started to bleed or something|`|t1uKdzmLaa	LOL!<br>  It was funny! I give it a 10 as well.<br>  The best part was when he threw Randy out of the window. :P|`|b5b208f51ea29006d50a669ea2891f87aa	A 9.5 outta 10?????? You must not have been watching the same RAW I was watching. The premise was good, but pleeeeeeeze, the acting by EVERYONE was atrocious. <br>  <br>  I give it a -2 for lack of acting skills.

It sounded fake. <br>  It was truly awful.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	about the same as you. 9.5.|`|3o8jPdWQaa	9 i wish the matches were better|`|VlvektSJaa	9/10|`|AP5bCHA3aa	10<br>  and I agree
Nuj1eScCaa	I'm guessing you just got done watching the show they just put on against Orlando lol?<br>  <br>  That was awesome, by far the best I've seen them play all year. Rodney, Antonio, Rip, Walter Herrmann, and Kwame Brown...yes Kwame Brown played great. <br>  <br>  I don't know why people say they're boring. The Pistons can be one the most exciting teams in the league when they play like that, defensive basketball and offensive rebounding.|`|kG9oI68eaa	Because the Hawks just swept them this season. Don't get me wrong the Pistons are a good team I just feel like they get unlucky sometimes|`|HiuNSScLaa	steal for bb|`|qtwYHyH5aa	idk|`|014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	I don't think they are boring. They are very exciting to watch. But people much rather watch Cleveland, L.A., and Boston. Apparently there's other teams that can put on a show. Like the Heat vs. the Bulls game. This is a good one. In a double overtime and the score is tied again. And the Rockets vs. the Nuggets. There's plenty of good showing teams.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The Heat just won 129-127. Good game.<br>  <br>  <br>  #1 Rockets Fan|`|rYqBGkwjaa	They don't have that one player that makes a game excited.<br>  <br>  Cavs have LeBron.<br>  Lakers Have Kobe.<br>  Hawks have Josh Smith and Joe Johnson.<br>  Kings have Kevin Martin.<br>  Celtics have Big 3.<br>  Bucks have Richard Jefferson.<br>  Pacers have Danny Granger.<br>  Magic have Dwight.<br>  Heat have Wade.<br>  Nets have Devin Harris.<br>  Trail Blazers have Roy.<br>  Clippers have Baron Davis.<br>  Warriors have Ellis.<br>  Phoenix has Shaq, Nash and Amar'e.<br>  San Antonio has Tony Parker.<br>  Mavs have Dirk.<br>  Bulls have Deng and Rose.<br>  Grizzlies have Gay and Mayo.<br>  Etc...|`|ISQAWUf2aa	i dont i think pistons are fun to watch and im a laker fan|`|JSryPP8faa	Because they're Magic fan's.|`|UWctMa0Taa	I don't really know...<br>  <br>  Sheed can dunk it down on your face, pull out for a three, and then hit one of his 1,000 half/3/4/full court shots...<br>  <br>  Iverson's the anklebreaker finishing mad-man, <br>  <br>  and rip puts points on the board so fast you tend to get excited, <br>  <br>  But hey, guess i'm biased, too... haha.<br>  <br>  Maybe because we're all fundamental + Half Court.
smcDn76jaa	Jessica sheep go baaaaaa no 'W'. Sorry just had to say that. RAW was great. Comedy, action, drama, realism too. Best Raw so far.

LOL|`|F3lyP5XLaa	it was good not great !!!!|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	I agree, the segment with HBK and Taker was great, surprise visits like Christian and Taker coming to Raw.

I wanted HHH to "kidnap" his wife though, lol. <br>  <br>  That would have been payback in the ultimate form|`|KWtjVW9saa	It does not matter if it was his real house or his real wife, (even though they could have used better actors) all that matters is the scenes with Randy and Triple H. Plus, the fighting was great and the shattered glass!|`|7d4414bc20ce9a4da7b8f7983a75f528aa	Ok I'm getting pissed with everyones confusion. That wasn't his god damn wife and that wasn't his god damn house. If you look at all her pictures from previous events that wasn't her. To the dumbass people that said she had a nose job and that's why Randy was allowed to get his sleeves. Um..right find me the damn interview or whatever website where you got the information from. If you can't pull that up then you obviously got the facts from out your ***<br>  About that being his house. Are you kidding me? That house was so God damn freggin flimsy and breakable that even a Soap Opera set was better than that. And it was so plain looking. Also Randy isn't such a jackass to leave his "wife" in the KITCHEN while he runs off. The window glass was obviously the fake glass stuntmen normally use.<br>  <br>   If you guys don't want to believe me then either tonight or by tomorrow check pwmania.com they will tell you everything you need to know. <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh did I mention his so-called "wife" looked like she could be a pornstar?|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Why not?<br>  Orton hates HHH anyway so it's not like he has to act a lot.<br>  I HOPE that Orton wins at WM, keep the tension between the two going!!|`|0YW0ZOchaa	It WAS real. that is his real wife.

yk4S7uuraa	Jose Reyes has 290 SBs and he's 25. <br>  <br>  For him to tie Rickey Henderson's record, he would need 74 SBs for each of the next 15 years. Right now, he's the only active player that has a shot at that record.<br>  <br>  Basically, I don't see it getting broken; especially of the Mets are going to bat Reyes third.|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	To break Rickey's record somebody will have to average 70+ steals a year for 20 years.  To give you an idea how difficult that is, there's only 2 active players that have even stolen 70 or more stolen bases in a season.  Scott Podsednik stole 70 in 2004 and Jose Reyes stole 78 in 2007.|`|UTlAc13Daa	Very unlikely it will be broken.  Pitchers approach games very differently now then they did 25 yrs ago.  Big windups are pretty much dead.  If anyone would have the opportunity to catch the single season record, it would be Ichiro because he gets to 1st base 175-200 times per season and he only steals around 40.|`|OXHLqBuwaa	Yes it will be broken, but it may take a few years. I think Jose Reyes may come close but wont break the record. An the fastest player on my team is Brett Garner on The New York Yankess, and Johnny Damon holds the record on the Yankees with 362.|`|zJC18FtAaa	No players don't steal as much in this era as they did in Henderson's era <br>  Jose Reyes might have a shot if he stays healthy and in the bigs for at least another 15 seasons|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	no one will break his record|`|cPc2Q6MHaa	Not sure about who could challenge the record, but I assume one day it will be broken.  There are so many records that people thought would never be broken, but someone always comes along and breaks them.  However, those pitching records that have been around for decades will likely never be broken.  Like most career wins.  Pitchers back then weren't pitching every 5 days like the guys now.  Plus the mound was higher so pitchers could just dominate batters all game long.  <br>  <br>  Also, Henderson wasn't really a speed demon.  He just had great baserunning awareness and got amazing jumps while stealing.  He picked great pitches to run on.|`|QgtoeqMdaa	yes it will. someday it may take awhile but it will be done. their is going to a freak that is gonna be a freakishly fast and it well enough shape to play a good 25 years

KQ2L5iLcaa	Well I think the "Really? You should have had more confidence in yourself" part isn't that great of an conversation opener. I would more go for the "Really, to bad.

6d545835a5ff634f419780c36f066c4eaa	Get some Salomon teneighties without a doubt. I've been skiing on them for 5 years and my skiing has come on leaps and bounds. I have thrusters in a 161 ( I'm 5'7'') as they are the original sidecut. They are now made in Romania rather than French Alps so you might get them cheaper on ebay. Don't bother with male/female varieties, just make sure you get decent bindings and suitable boots if you want to start jumping.|`|jTFdG8xqaa	look for ski's from a few years back. I would get something with a 75 mininum foot with or higher for some moderate powder or 80 plus for better powder performance. Line is a good company, but just about everybody makes a good park ski now. Look for old ski's though (like 2006 or something) you can save a lot of money and ket a really good ski.|`|aqGLKCxyaa	Defiantly woman's, they are more Flexible and for us its easier to turn in the air with lighter skis. I would recommend looking at Line, Rossie, Vollki, most of the popular names for caving/racing skis have twin tips. I shred Line ( and love it !) but I know rossie makes really good twin tips. If you really plan to do rails then you want shorter skis, but not too short. Ask a sales person about sizing, i don't know much more than that about it. Also you might want to look into park boots, or all purpose boots... they make a difference. <br>  <br>  have fun shredding :)|`|VtEZ7AoUaa	I think your best bet is to go with womens ski. beacuse they are designed for women. a good all around ski for powder park etc is the armada ARVw womens. on the armada site they rate each ski out of ten by different facotrs . the ARVw scores an 8/10 in powder a 9/10 in big mtn. and a 9/10 in park. if you want to examine the ski go to this link <a href="http://www.armadaskis.com/product/skis/" rel="nofollow">http://www.armadaskis.com/product/skis/</a>|`|ZCG1C3PBaa	Salomon teneighties are good, any Head twins are amazing, Rossignols have a few decent ones. K2s have great powder skis if you want to pay a little more. You would need longer skis than 160, twins cut off about the last 4 inches of the ski. and powder you will want longer skis so go with like a 170-180|`|oij6ZrxXaa	Salomon Suspects or Line Shadows are the way to go|`|DHeqYNS9aa	i got my salamon skis at the beggining fo this season, and with bindings they were 550. they were however this years models

His stint on "Around the Horn" demonstrated his fast wit, intelligence, humor and sports knowledge. His boxing knowledge is very impressive and your right - he speaks his mind! I will however disagree with his and your assessment of Marquez versus Pacman. I believed Pacman won both fights just as the judges had it (very close for sure but the knockdowns were very telling) and despite the quality of opponents issues, based on his two victories over Marquez, Pacman is pound for pound the best right now. <br>  BTW, as much as I appreciate Max Kellerman, I can't stand that blowhard hack of an announcer - Larry Merchant! Can somebody please just shoot the guy in the head and take him out of his misery, he drives me crazy with his slow cadence and idiotic attempts at trying to sound profound or eloquent, he needs to go!! Are you with me on that?!|`|2f0d8b0ba23a243ba5699d5b29e7002baa	if this is the guy that interviewed Chris John after the Juarez fight <br>  then he is very poor at what he does.|`|ZVaJM4neaa	Nah I don't like this peice of shyt.

a5hNA3Kxaa	Yes it did, just because WWE went PG dosen't mean they cant do crazy things. Remember PG means Parental Guidance, I am 15 and do find some things on Raw stupid. But that house segment was not PG at all.  This is something that would happen during the attitude era.

UO3bMm0Xaa	I think it will depends upon what level of Synchro you are wanting to get involved with it.<br>  <br>  There are several Universities that have Junior and Senior level teams associated with them, but there are several Universities that skate at lower levels (Adult, Beginner, College, etc).<br>  <br>  I know in Ohio, there are at least 3 Universities that have Synchro teams.  Miami/Oxford - Junior/Senior level, as well as some their non college club has some lower level teams.  Bowling Green (BGSU) has at least an Adult or College team.  Then OSU has a team as well, but I think they skate in the ISI (Ice Skating Institute) competitions.<br>  <br>  It will also depending upon if you are wanting to skate USFSA or ISI for Synchro.  If you go ISI, the programs are not generally associated with a College, but where I live we have several colleges and the ISI team is open to any skater (not just college skaters) and it is not associated with a college either.<br>  <br>  Another great source for information is:<br>  <a href="http://www.synchroboards.com/board/index.php?s=6ec17a660e5eee612c4fc25dc39554ac&showforum=9" rel="nofollow">http://www.synchroboards.com/board/index...</a>|`|4T5iaRKcaa	i know that cornell university, suny oswego, Boston university, Boston college, princton, university at buffalo, syracuse university, as the other girl said before check out usfsa.org and look it up!|`|n0Xt61fcaa	I believe usfsa.org has a full list, but off the top of my head, I know University of Delaware, University of Michigan, Miami University (in Ohio), Western Michigan, and University of Wisconsin all have teams.<br>  <br>  Also, you could consider teams that aren't specifically linked with a university by are located near cities that have good universities (Haydenettes are one).<br>  <br>  I would really check out usfsa.org's website, though, as I'm sure they'll have a far more comprehensive list.

If you are a female athlete, your menstrual period will roll around (hopefully) regularly, and you can't just sit out.  <br>  <br>  Use a tampon -- practice using them before the match if you've never used one before.  I'd recommend using a new one right before you start warmups, then hit the restroom as soon as you can when the match is over.  <br>  <br>  Good luck -- it'll be fine.

IrWFzPpMaa	Usually we call these types of layers in tennis, pushers. They basically play their game very defensively and get every ball back,usually not with with alot of power and speed,but alot of control.To deal with this type of a game,you need to hit shorter balls and then pass the player with some passing shots. Even hitting shorter balls and mixing your shots up should give the player a harder time to win more points off of you. You could also hit shorter balls and as they come up to the net,hit some very nice lobs,right above the player. Make sure to be patient though!|`|MExiWz7Zaa	ehh<br>  had the same prob last yr...i have the problem again but i can still win..<br>  im a hard hitter for my age (14) <br>  but i usually hit hard and most of the time he runs it down...so i thought mayb if i get him way behind the baseline i can drop sot him orrr hit him a lob and expect  lob bac and then go to the net for a easy smash!!|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	drop shot him alot.. volley.. lob him.. mix it up..<br>  try different things.... hit more angles on him....|`|GnzkKm1Taa	haha i have a friend thats exacally like that all he does is just puts it in play and i always get frustrated with it and always made lots of errors. These players that do that are known as hackers and they do whatever it takes to put the ball in play. to beat a hacker all you have to do is volley the ball.<br>  <br>  1. play some good solid groundstrokes<br>  2.after about 5 solid groundies approach to net (make sure your approach is really good)<br>  3. Once your at net its much much easier to win the point as you are in a excellent position for attacking<br>  4. Don'tyt just put the winnig volley straight away put fitness in the game and make him/her run then win the point<br>  <br>  If you get frustrated alot all you have to say to yourself is that the more anger you put in your game the more your opponent will feed off it, just keep cool and keep the ball deep if you in a desperate position<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|M2Cx9uqzaa	either force him to the net with a short ball and then pass or lob him<br>  <br>  or come to the net yourself and force him to beat you. most pushers dont have good passing shots|`|GZc2hVWtaa	drop shot...<br>  then pass him or lob him<br>  they are pushers not tappers|`|KwqZmlZRaa	Yea... was going to remind you they are called pushers. Anyways I don't really agree with what the other two guys said before, trying drop shots is not smart.. its a very low percentage shot and most times you will fail and hit the net or you will give your opponent the easiest approach shot ever and will lose the point anyway. Plus if your not good at lobbing or passing shot pulling him to the net will give him easy volley winners. Basically the best thing to do is never underestimate a pusher just because they don't have impressive shots, always keep in mind that they CAN beat you. Also always remember that you WILL miss shots, just don't let it get to your head and stick to your normal strokes, play your game, not his. <br>  <br>  Mechanically speaking the best way to play a pusher during a match is to get to the net and put away some volley and overhead winners. If   they are a real pusher there passing shot skills won't be to impressive so you don't have to worry about them hitting winners on you and he will give you lots of short shots to approach to the net on. also you will keep him under constant pressure this way and will force him to hit the ball faster etc. giving more chance for him to mess up. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|gPqBBfsgaa	Try to strengthen your mechanics <br>  <br>  go to:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fuzzyyellowballs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fuzzyyellowballs.com</a><br>  <br>  Sign up, it's fast and FREE and you'll get pro help from a pro coach.

TBAfpnmgaa	No you don't need a license, but I am curious about the rest of your question. How exactly are you expecting a BB gun to protect you? If you're thinking about shooting a person with it, all you'll accomplish is making them mad, and getting yourself in trouble with the law. Owning a BB gun isn't illegal, but shooting someone with one is.<br>  On the other hand, if your safety is being threatened by some pesky sparrows or something, a BB gun may be of help.|`|BY02DhfWaa	no but i think if you use it you have to have an adult with you and you cant buy it you are not old enough. you have to be 18 .|`|yetGbkdBaa	no you don't|`|HG7USP9Faa	First of all a bb gun is just gonna piss someone off. To answer your question, unless there is a specific town or city ordinance,no. I think you need one in NJ though.|`|PnS3wHQiaa	No, because it's not a firearm. By the way, you're not going to protect yourself from anything bigger than a squirrel.|`|2OpYUFMuaa	Ha own safety gotta pump them 20 or so times do even hurt or kill a small animal|`|Ftxbh5Ulaa	no it isn't a fire arm because no gun powder is being used and good luck protecting yourself from somthing smaller than a dog, unless you really want to protect yourself I would suguest a pellet gun you don't need a liscens to get that either, it's more money but worth it it has a lot more power|`|djNeNEOuaa	No, and in fact felons can own BB and pellet guns as they are not firearms. As far as using one for your own safety you may be better off using a baseball bat. Not that I am implying that you go around and beat people with a bat.|`|yqx9YTBJaa	You don't need a "license" to own a normal gun, except for in a few urban gutters where the Bill of Rights doesn't exist any more.<br>  <br>  You certainly don't need one for a BB gun.|`|ecb27a7a567ad1d172f645e812967f50aa	Yes....in NJ & also in NYC|`|QtoDx4Vtaa	No.|`|Wqv6EgXbaa	get a pump pellet gun...more dangerous|`|g7sZ8elHaa	no|`|snVqB2rVaa	nope|`|QuduR6kdaa	If you want to own a BB gun for your own safety, you better hope that whoever you need to protect yourself from is really afraid of getting welts, or at worst, having a BB under their skin. Unless you're trying to protect yourself from a small rodent.<br>  <br>  The fact that they are almost harmless is why you don't need a license for them.|`|XbydA2O1aa	You have not indicated which country you are from & none of the respondents have bothered to ask that question.

yRPYuJhsaa	I've been skating for 4 years now, I haven't lost any weight (from skating), and I skate at least 2 hours a day, non-stop. I've even asked doctors and they would never recommend skateboarding in order to lose weight. Why not just go to a gym instead of trying to learn something completely new that you will be hurt a lot at?<br>  <br>  That's just a heads up before you make any decisions.|`|vABufZ1Laa	I say u start tomorrow.!  Well for skateboarding will only help u lose weight if your good at it.  I have been skating for 1 year and a half and u used to be like almost obese.! Now i am skinny and have loose skin.  I just gatta get taller.  Well and it also depends how much your skate.  And yes it gives you muscles on your legs and gives you hops.!  I love skating and its my thing.! good luck and hope i help.!  Oh yea and i almost forgot,  u will fall a LOT of times but it doesnt matter.!  Im sure u can handle it.!|`|Y7rKk5hUaa	Learn the signs and symptoms.  <br>  skateboarding yes can loose some weight. Ive been skateboarding for 3 years now and yeah ive lost some weight. not intentionally but you lose it mostly in the lower body, hips, thighs, butt, legs. <br>  <br>  Any activity that gets your heart pumping is a good way to burn more calories, which in turn, can lead to weight loss. Be sure to wear the proper protective equipment when skateboarding.|`|ZHJUTlXwaa	you're standing up a lot, moving muscles and sweating constantly. how much you lose is related to how much you skateboard. you could just walk or something instead?|`|m7nKg5Fxaa	It works your legs  a lot. as well as a bit of weight loss your legs will get stronger.

Gsqt4ODYaa	You want to make sure you're doing full splits, middle, and sides.  Make sure you're real limber all over really, do a lot of stretches.<br>  <br>  To jump higher, train the muscles that help you jump.  Do a lot of calve exercises, and squats.  That will build muscle to help you get higher.<br>  <br>  You certainly can learn how to back tuck in a week, I learned in a day.  It's pretty easy really, it just takes a lot of courage to attempt.  I would head to a gymnastics place, and have a gymnast help you.  They'll help you get your roundoff to back handsprings to back tucks.  It really isn't that hard, and you'll be tumbling in cheerleading in no time.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|PxtmMAMnaa	im sorry sweetheart but backhandsprings dont come in one week. especially not back tucks and fulls. good luck.|`|13ea41be1ed273ced19b63d4ecc61592aa	Okay here's the break down. You may pull off a bh in about a week if you go to a gym.I REPEAT go to a gym because these tumbling techniques aren't anything to play with and can be VERY dangerous to try on your own.So please just find time to go to a tumbling class maybe on the weekend. Then move on to the others but doing these on your own can take more time to learn and cause injuries.<br>    Another thing is to stretch a lot.If you  attend a tumbling class that can help you also with stretching.For help with jumps point them toes girl.By you pointing your toes they'll look neat and even if they're not the highest at least your they look decent and by you keep pointing your toes they'll get higher and higher TRUST ME!<br>  <a href="http://cheerwiz.com/cheerjum.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cheerwiz.com/cheerjum.htm</a> (CHECK THIS OUT)<br>                                                                          CHEER HEAD =)
VIfXKhmNaa	Often times in March and April on the Colorado River north of Lake Buchanan in the Texas hill country, I will catch a bunch of Hellgrammies and fish them on a drifting line with a small split shot for channel cats. While I release most of them, often times I am stopped and asked what I caught them on. Since some of these fish will be in the 5 to 10 lb range it catches peoples eye. Their great bait for a channels, in swift water and clear rivers.
3vjBXCGbaa	he retired- left the UFC about a year ago, and has came back for a couple smaller organizations and most recently Affliction, TOM ATENCIO's Afflictionm , not freakin coutures|`|ULw1777caa	He's still reffing.  He actually just did the last Affliction event.|`|ySvQf3e5aa	Its questionable whether he returns to ref in the octagon or not but one things for sure MMA needs better refs and better guidelines for them as well. Yves Lavigne isn't a terrible ref, however that was a huge mistake, if you call the fight than its over, you can't restart it. Rick Fike sucks, one of the refs they had for Fight for the Troops was terrible, (he restarted the fighters even when one of them took the others back because they were being "too boring"), and Dan Mirgliota sucks as well. Big John will always be the OG of reffing but guys like Herb Dean and Mario Yamasaki are still great refs as well.|`|AA10069553	I don't think the UFC needs him as they still have great refs in Herb Dean and Mario Yamasaki. Yves Lavigne ****** up, every ref has that one fight where a lot of people are pissed off but good refs always rebound. It is kinda sad that Big John left because he is kinda a UFC legend/relic, but whatever. Can live without him, but he is still a cool guy to have around. At least Joe didn't say that the ref should be shot again. (Did he?)|`|bF6E4T4Jaa	agreed<br>  UFC should bring BIg John Mccarthy back to ref, not a fan  Yves Lavigne, like you said last I heard he was involved with affliction.<br>  <br>  herb dean and john mccarthy for the win!|`|AA11461754	he left...

xOReEw6Waa	I've seen Mossberg ATRs for under $300 with no scope, and considering I could buy a decent quality Nikon for $200 then the Package price isn't really that big of a bargain. I'm not a big fan of the ATR, they are a "basic" rifle but for the same price ($300) you can get a bare Savage rifle or a Howa 1500 / Weatherby Vanguard, either are a quantum improvement over the ATR. The non-Accu-Trigger Stevens models from Savage sell for $275 locally, as does the newer Marlin XL-7. <br>  I see rifles as more than just tools, more like investments in time and efforts, so I don't mind paying more for my Brownings. I plan on buying my son a Tikka T3 when he is ready to upgrade from his current single shot .243. The Tikka goes for $500, and comes close to what I expect in a Browning.<br>  Howa has a package deal for a 308 with a Nikko-Sterling scope on it for $429 at Joe's Sporting Goods, and that is something you could have ordered through WalMart even.<br>  Again, I would choose other rifles than the Mossberg in a similar price range. Do stay away from the Remington 770 package, they are a throw-away gun in the long run. <br>  I've been looking at guns for the last few weeks with my son, and there are a lot of bargains out there. Almost bought a CZ 550 in 6.5x55 Swede for $550, which is a real bargain for a gun built like a bank vault.|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	This one is $455. If it's new, that seems like a fair price.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	Depending on the scope it could be a good deal.  I bought my Mossberg ATR 100 in .30-06 for $250.  That was a couple years ago before the metal prices climbed.  The Mossberg ATR isn't a luxury rifle it won't win any beauty contest, but it is a well built rifle for the money.

RGieBkTqaa	Iv been asked this question before in the pub :) <br>  <br>  and my answer is a definate yes, no matter how or what you do at pool or snooker for that matter you are always going to be training yourself to hit the ball correct for the angle required to get the ball in the pocket. Not only that but you will also be getting better cue ball control and and a better cueing action. When i younger i used to practice pool alone, and in my opinion it did help your still practicing potting balls and playing for a ball afterwards etc. So i would DEFINITLY say that you can practice pool alone. Playing alone is better than not playing at all :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Well no. The real thing is always better than some computer.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Might help you with some of the angles. But aint nothing like the real thing.|`|Pk94l8RHaa	Yes you can.<br>  I have been playing pool since i was 8 yrs old. I learned from a good mentor at times but i was always on the table by myself. At age 11, 12 i was beating grown people i had got so good. So to anwser you question yes you can. It does work on your shot, angel, you can get the feel of the ball and stick as well. Have fun! <br>  P.s If you are serious about learing pool, i dont know how old you are, but if youre at least 18, id find a sports bar to go to and do some pratcing on a real table. That is what i did.|`|HWQKH93Iaa	yes their are may ways to improve your shot by practicing by yourself. I prefer to set up shots repetitively to improve various shot such as a tight bank shot or a hard cut shot. plus their is always just shooting a game yourself and reacting to various situations.|`|8Rg4WODraa	Is that a metaphor for masturbation?<br>  <br>  If so, then yes.
Hkb7xoaQaa	I agree with you, to an extent. Of course Ryan is trying to make the Jets a defensive team, defense is what he knows and that is why your owners signed him. We all know the cliche, defense wins championships, but that saying is very true so you can't blame your team for trying to become more defensive. I think Rex Ryan and the Baltimore Ravens and even the Steelers have proven that even anemic, one sided offenses can make it to the playoffs, and that is what the Jets need to do. They dropped Coles because the guy is a blatant under achiever who hasn't had much chemistry or impact on the offense since he first left the jets,(He's only had one 1000 yard season in the past four years), so don't be too sad about him leaving. The Jets are going to try and do the smart thing which is build their offense through a solid run game in Jones, that will take pressure off the QB until he develops and grows comfortable with the offense. In the mean while, they have one of the best defensive minds in football on their side and with his clever defensive schemes and punishing blitz schemes. The Jets could win 10 games next year with their improved defense carrying them, and if it takes a season or two with ten wins to find a franchise QB I don't know why Jets Fans would be mad. If i were you i would just hope they don't draft Stafford or Sanchez this year, i don't think either of those guys are ever going to be great in the NFL. Just accept a ten win season and wait for Colt McCoy, Sam Bradford or Max Hall Next year|`|f4ea933ff2710d6621207b1fad09d53aaa	so youre saying this is going to basically be turned into a tampa bay team, with an awesome defense and a less than par offense?....i agree, to have a fairly decent offense, torry holt and an amazing draft....or an super amazing draft will have to be in the jets future. dustin keller looks promising, and the current wr's are decent, but aren't going to be the guys you look at as being hero wide receivers.|`|lecAdFRvaa	you have to use periods because I just stopped trying to read this.|`|mukMu3IHaa	Aren't Rex Ryan and Andy Reid brothers?  they look alike|`|AA10350396	Once again, I think he's limited in his choices. So often, the decisions are made up above ( see S.D. Chargers ) and those who make the personnel / money choices just don't seem to care about what te coach wants. It's turning more into " We make the choices and you deal with what we give you".<br>  <br>  <br>  I kind of liked Mangini. I really did. But I believe he was hampered by those above. Ryan is to me, an unproven in the head coach position. I do not want to say anything negative as I have nothing to go by. i DO hope for the best. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And i DO hope we hunt after Vick.
K34MFR6Zaa	i don't know any personally,but you should try contacting your local parks and rec. office. they could have information about leagues.
Hkb7xoaQaa	If you really want to play linebacker and you weigh 245 you'll need to work on your speed because that is the only thing your coach would be worried about. You would probably play middle linebacker but you would have to be able to run down defenders, drop in coverage and hit the gaps hard and fast. If you could get your 40 time down to 5.0, you would be fast enough to play LB in high school. Drop 10 or 15 pounds and im sure your coach would love to have a big smasher in the middle. The best way to get yourself faster is Plyometrics, it's a type of exercise designed to produce fast and powerful movements. It involves a lot of jumping (Box jump, dot drills, broad jump, high jumps, even jump rope). If you combine this with a good lower body and core strength work outs your 40-time is guaranteed to go up, in high school my 40 went from 5.2 sophomore year to 4.6 at the end of my junior year (granted i never really worked out before my first timed 40, it still made a big difference). I topped out at 4.56 by my senior year.<br>  5 days ago|`|flzuqUJNaa	how fast are you? i see you weight alot, is it mostly fat or muscle? If you have the speed try dropping 10 or 12 pounds and give mike linebacker a shot, but it sounds to me like you would make a killer fullback or lineman. No shame in playing the line, my sophomore year of high school i switched from fullback to d-end and i never looked back. It was a better fit and i was great at d-end. Go with what you feel comfortable with. Your coaches should be able to advise you best.|`|f4ea933ff2710d6621207b1fad09d53aaa	get a lot of speed try to run in at least a 4.7 or 4.8 range and maybe lose a little weight for aerodynamic purpose and tone up a bit and you should be good to go. there. being 16, it should be any problem at the high school level, but im not really sure the college level|`|gBfPkdroaa	damn, you must be chunky of some sort.<br>  <br>  hmm, well i think you can play fullback based on your weight.<br>  <br>  it also depends, do you have a lot of muscle on you? if so, than yea, you can play LB.<br>  <br>  you can be just like london fletcher (who isnt a bad player)|`|RFPtIcx5aa	Weight train! That's the most important thing for a young football player to do, regardless of position. Obviously I don't know your % fat / muscle, but most likely you'll want to lose some fat and gain muscle weight. Shoot for the 230 range at your height, though hopefully you'll grow a little more. 6'0" is considered undersized for the NFL, but there are smaller LBs who are successful, especially in college. Good luck.
Pc0QjrQ4aa	Search for British/Irish pubs in the area.  Call them and ask if they'll be showing the rugby.  <br>  <br>  Setanta (correct spelling) used to have a list on their US website of participating pubs; couldn't tell you if they still do.<br>  <br>  Typically, the pub will charge you US$20-$25 as a cover charge to watch the match to cover their costs of buying the match on PPV.<br>  <br>  Best of luck; be interesting to see if Ireland can do the business this year.

Do not get anything more than 102.<br>  <br>  I have had Thornton, Gagne, Sakic, Lindros, Crosby, Datsyuk, Lidstrom, Malkin and Kane curves and...<br>  <br>  Gagne's is by far the best for wristshots and snapshots. It does lack the backhand the Datsyuk has tho.<br>  <br>  Below is an ebay link to see the stick i mentioned|`|ZVwgdUXjaa	You can start here. =) It's where I bought mine<br>  <a href="http://www.nikebauer.com/?path=/Content/Hub/ID.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nikebauer.com/?path=/Content/...</a><br>  <br>  It's not only the name, it helps you choose the curve, flex and length of your stick.

Even if you don't want to buy one of those sticks, that could help you to figure out what the flex might be on a stick you've cut down.|`|UkW9FPEZaa	CCM U+ about an 80-85 flex with a Thornton curve or whatever curve you are used to. <br>  Get a Senior Int. is too small.|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	Hmm, i don't see why a senior stick is too tall for you. Im 5"3 and i cut down a senior stick about 3 inches and its perfect. It was originally a 85 flex, now probaly a 90. I think you should go for the senior size stick, usually 60 inches from the heel of the blade to the top of the stick. <br>  But to the actual stick purchasing part...hmm well one thing is how much money are you willing to spend. The NikeBauer One95 is a great stick for mostly slap shots and a Vapor XXXX is a stick for a guy like you...made for wrist shots and snap shots. Personally, i love the rbk 9k o-stick. It is currently only $109 at hockeymonkey.com. It is a great stick for explosive slap shots and accurate wristers. I don't know what else to tell you besides that.<br>  Good Luck with finding a stick!

PHamImDsaa	Well if you would like me to define it emotionally and physically it's easy.<br>  Surfing is the greatest feeling on this planet. Once you catch your first wave your hooked for life. People out there think surfing is just catching waves but it has way more meaning to it. It is stero-typed all around the world.<br>  The best way i can help you is the best feeling is when you actually arrive at the surfing spot and it's firing. But there's no better feeling than paddling out there with all your mates and watching him getting  shacked off his head,(meaning barreled).<br>  A local surfing break means a lot to the surfers not emotionally but spiritually. The spiritual connection a surfer has to have with the location he surfs is huge. But that's a little off the question but that will help you add a little bit more onto your story. But emotionally there is no better feeling. You paddle into a 8ft wave which is about 3-4m bottom turn and pull inside the barrel with all your mates cheering you on in the channel honestly nothing can beat it. <br>  It's a pretty physically demanding spot when your actually getting really into it. paddling out duck diving, you could catch 20 waves in one session and the wave might go for a few hundred meters and then have to paddle back out. But that does not bother us surfers we live for it.<br>  Iv given the best answer to your question i can but to be true with you i think to get a real insight into the character you have to surf. Any where along the coast there is surfing schools and not to expensive. Then you will actually not what it feels like. Us surfers use a quote "There's no better feeling"<br>  <br>  Peter Henderson|`|rOY2J0UAaa	Rapture|`|xhPKkkELaa	Ivy,<br>  <br>  Then write a story about some sport that you can connect with. Or, get yourself to a beach and take some surfing lessons. I am a pretty fair 'wordsmith', but I have real difficulty in describing the feel of surfing. And, I have been doing it for almost 43 years. In the same instant, you can experience wild exhilaration and total serenity. The juxtaposition of the two is amazing. There are many phases, from paddling out, to sitting in the line up (waiting either for the right wave, or a chance to get one that hasn't been 'taken' at a crowded break). Then there is taking off. You paddle strenuously, feel the wave take over and then...Do you make the right move or weight shift, or flub it and wipe out? And once you start riding, is a long slow, longboard cruise, or are you carving up and down the face of the wave on a performance board? You see, Ivy, there is way too much to go into for a 'non-surfer' to get the feeling right. So, either write about another sport, or come on down to the ocean and see for yourself.|`|MA69FQajaa	when you are in the barrel its better than sex

That is why he is shooting nearly 50%. Wade should be MVP this year.|`|WUzgGtAAaa	Kobe isn't selfish, he leads the team in assists and has done so several times in his career. If you watched the Laker game, they were playing terrible and got blown out, Kobe was trying to keep the Lakers in it, but couldn't do it.<br>  <br>  Kobe does have more offensive weapons, but Odom didn't show up (again) and the bench got killed. Hell, the whole team got killed.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	Kobe: 11 - 29 (26 points)<br>  <br>  The rest of the Lakers Starters: 11 - 24 (32 points)<br>  .........................................<br>  <br>  Kobe took 35.4% of the Lakers shots, which resulted in 29 points<br>  <br>  D-Wade took 22.5% of the Heat's shots which lead to 48 points<br>  .........................................<br>  D-Wade: 12 Assists, (57 Assists in last 5 games)<br>  <br>  Kobe: 11 Assists (Last 4 games combined), 13 Assists (Last 5 games combined)<br>  .........................................<br>  <br>  Kobe career high APG: 15 (13 years in the league)<br>  <br>  D-Wade: has had two games with 16apg, in less than one season.|`|UYPfC5YVaa	It doesn't really matter if the star player is considered a ball-hog as long as his team is winning and on top of the standings.|`|IUxM3brbaa	When you can score 81 points in a game by yourself it's called winning, not being selfish.|`|NGYoZs1Kaa	maybe because he was trying to get his team to win so all of the laker fans wouldnt look like idiots for going for a team that lost to a sorry *** team like portland ?|`|Vx9Lvt9Aaa	kobe HAS to take those shotssss.....its not about being selfish......the lakers are struggling right nowww... the team is not vibinggg.......dwade is playing great but dont base one game off ur concept<br>  <br>  <br>  FALSE|`|yt05KPhBaa	False|`|bcdda81b9d8d3b625f85a27ddaee6592aa	Efficiency, efficiency, efficiency.<br>  Who cares?<br>  The record is a little more important then that.  He would not be jacking up trash shots for the heck of it if they were barely making the playoffs. Cushions are cushions, and no matter what, Kobe can pass. Does he always choose to, but when he does their team winning percentage is remarkable. He just chooses not to pass because he sometimes" doesn't want to or would rather jack up a shot hoping it will go in.?<br>  Can't really look at one game and say he sucks.  Choose a day where Dwade has a bad freethrow shooting game.<br>  <br>  Because he gets to the line so often you could argue that because he gets to the line so often he should take that kind of stuff seriously|`|JgAE7eV9aa	I as a Heat fan and a inhabitan of MIAMI I know that D.Wade was never ever a ball hogger.And plus every one in Miami knows that Kobe be taking like 30 shots per games especially me cause I got League Pass.|`|1a4f8OD1aa	false i dont think either are selfish both great player and if i was the coach i would want both taking as many shots as possable|`|BFOOOzwBaa	dwade aint selfish at all nether is kobe kobe just isnt a play maker like dwade and dwade passes all the time he would have more asstpg if he had a better shooting team|`|JV2mxI75aa	hey when the games on the line it ok to be a ball hog that why they pay you to win game and if that mean taking 21 shots then so be it|`|LNd0tPGkaa	True, DWADE is also way more efficient.|`|52luRGoVaa	well, kobe is not as selfish as he was a couple of seasons ago.|`|KYaM65gzaa	I know Wade gets to the line a lot, so remember his 21 shots doesn't count ones where he drived, was fouled and missed the shot. But he's still not selfish, just saying there would have been other shots (probably for both guys), that dont show up on the stat sheet.<br>  <br>  Yes, Kobe is by far more selfish.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Thank you Mamba! The truth comes out!|`|mG2BCZe7aa	I just have to commend you with this observation. But I guess it's also because of the nature of their offense. Wade is a slasher that is why he hits his shots inside the paint more, with that higher FG percentage follows. Bryant is more of an outside bomber, he's reliant to that that is why he takes more shots just to get to his average points... What is amazing though your observation about the assists, I don't have any answers for Bryant about that but this just shows why Wade deserves the MVP more this year. He also have 4 steals right? Your guys beat my team tonight. Good job.<br>  <br>  Bulls fan.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	Dwyane Wade is going to be the best in the NBA very soon. Him and LeBron will dominate the game. Kobe is more selfish, but he was probably very angry with the game and just wanted to shoot the **** out of the basket. I'm telling you this once, Kobe is overrated passing wise he is more selfish than it seems. Wade contributes to his team and you could tell he loves the Heat.|`|ExVTrokAaa	haha this is why stats are MISLEADING. No one was making shots for the Lakers(including Kobe) the Lakers were getting blown out, somone had to find the rythm!<br>  if you actually watched the game you wouldn't be saying that but of course you just looked at stats to determine your opinion.|`|FUoKu13Daa	I would say this,  When Wade do have big games as far as scoring he usually have a lot more assists than Kobe, <br>  <br>  A

Seems like us Laker fans waited an entire last season- and we got off to such a great start only to have him get hurt again. Looking forward to the Lakers hopefully being able to play their best ball of the year at the right time of the year.<br>  <br>  BQ1:  Ideally the Lakers would play the Suns and we would pay them back from several years ago-- plus its great for the NBA with the whole Shaq-Kobe history.<br>  <br>  BQ2:  Trevor is most definitely a beast - and i don't like how flagrants are being called these days more on how the player lands- thaen on the actual play itself- Trevor played the ball and i hope the league reviews the film carefully.<br>  <br>  BQ3:  Yes and No. When i speak Taiwanese or Mandarin i have an accent.  But when people hear my English most people think i was born in the States even though i was born in Taiwan.<br>  <br>  BQ4:  The Lakers have been bouncing back quite well after losses this season- and with a day off tomorrow- hopefully they can refocus and come out and play intensely.  They need to win to build some momentum going into Thursday's game versus San Antonio and also to get the bad taste of tonight out of their mouths!

Nuj1eScCaa	He pretty much has it locked up. Lebron will have to average well over 32 ppg to pass Dwyane in scoring average. I don't think Kobe can even catch him. He'll have to average better than 35 ppg for 20 games.<br>  <br>  Dwyane hasn't shown any signs of letting up on scoring, so unless something very strange happens consider it his.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	False.  He's only got an 81 point lead on LeBron.  LeBron gets hot for a few games like Wade has been lately, or Wade misses a couple of games with an injury, and LeBron takes the scoring title.  He'll probably win it, but he's far from a lock.<br>  <br>  And Wade won't get MVP either.  MVP simply doesn't go to a team that's ranked fifth in their own division.  The MVP *always* comes from one of the two or three best teams in the league.|`|8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	What up King,<br>  <br>  The way that he's going right now -- quite likely he should be the favored at this point.<br>  <br>  In terms of the MVP running- with the way Wade has been playing as of late- he most certainly deserves some consideration.<br>  <br>  Nickster|`|4DcvpQXfaa	So far that's true<br>  <br>  Because he's 1 man show in his team just like LeBron in 2005-2006|`|WUzgGtAAaa	thats the only award he will win this year.|`|yt05KPhBaa	He really does deserve MVP. He (tonight) got 12 assists and managed to score 48 points on only 21 shots.|`|wd7XuvKnaa	True or False: You love giving head to D-Wade?|`|HiuNSScLaa	i agree and he is mvp what you talking about|`|3bd3d6c24c39616e8221985f212c2c13aa	If he stays consistent It looks like it <br>  Kobe and Lebron are avg 28.1 ppg<br>  Dwayne is avg 29.4<br>  <br>  when Kobe shoots more than 24 or 25 shots pg they usually lose.|`|JgAE7eV9aa	I want to say true but Lebron and Kobe aren't done yet.<br>  <br>  The NBA saves it's best for last!|`|7e6Vm4cDaa	True.|`|BFOOOzwBaa	no doubt hes gone have around 30 to 32 ppg <br>  while kobe and lebron stay arounde 28|`|A7OCbBJNaa	True...He's No.9 in the Assists category..Kobe wasn't even 15th in assists when he used to lead the league in scoring..Triangle offense or not, Kobe is more selfish than D-Wade. If Kobe was playing for the Heat, he would be averaging 30 shot attempts right now, and less players would get involved...|`|NEtVRjplaa	*first time I'm agreeing with you.<br>  <br>  Wade deserves MVP.. that's all I'm saying.<br>  <br>  edit: <br>  <br>  I'm not saying that LBJ and KB24 aren't deserving.. I'm just saying that Wade deserves it more.. now that's all I'm saying.|`|9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	Wade is defintely the front runner for th scoing title, although LeBrono James or Kobe Bryant could catch up to him with a good scoring run.  <br>  <br>  "DWYANE WADE FOR 2009 MVP!"<br>  If the MVP award actually lived up to it's name, Wade would be the fronrunner this season and LeBron James would've one the award last year.  But since the who get the award is largely dependent on team record, LeBron will probably get it this year when he should''ve got it last uear and Wade will probably get snubed from the 1st team All-Nba team in favor of Kobe, when he clearly outperforms by his 2 guard conterpart  in almost very category.  <br>  <br>  MVP doesn't actually mean 'most valuable player'.|`|FUoKu13Daa	If Wade keep scoring the way he is then yes he will win it, but all it takes is an injury that slows him down or teams starting to double and triple team him then his scoring average will drop.<br>  <br>  But I can also see Kobe jacking up  more shots to take the scoring titles and he would have the excuse of taking all those shots because he will say is team needs him to score more.<br>  <br>  But Like I said they way he is scoring and LBJ resting a lot because their team been so good that a lot of their starters have been resting in the 4th quarter that Wade should have the scoring crown this year.|`|qOWJQ7hRaa	Yes.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	How about the MVP. yes.
IMu3wBu8aa	1.) 10/10 =)<br>  <br>  2.) Yes. I love when them two are in the same room or ring. Their history alone makes the chemistry. Then add in their charisma, talent, great mic skills. They are great together. I can get used to this :)<br>  <br>  3.) No. I would be upset though. Flair has a passion for Wrestling. He can't help it. That's who he is. I don't think he will wrestle. I'm hoping for Stone Cold to trash talk Jericho next week. I'm sure The..I mean Dwayne won't do it. Plus, we need some SCSA before Mania comes.<br>  <br>  4.) It's nice to see people with a passion for Wrestling. They are like Flair. They can't help the love for the business. Like Foley said, "once a wrestler, always a wrestler" ...I believe it.<br>  <br>  5.) Yes. I was very excited about that. I missed things like this. I miss them even going back stage...which HHH and Orton also did. <br>  <br>  6.) Lmao...I guess so. As long as Edge turns face and goes back to being solo...and starts winning on his own.

I'd give a 7. Solid show, some good stuff, but not without flaws.<br>  <br>  2. It was fine. UT botched a line & it maybe went slightly too long, but they're both vets. They know how to get a storyline over.<br>  <br>  3. I can't say I'd lose respect, he's still a legend, but I'd be terribly disappointed. It was only a year ago and it was a perfect sendoff.<br>  <br>  4. I don't really care to see it. Foley's out of shape & it's not like their 1st mini-fued was one for the ages or anything.<br>  <br>  5. It definitely did. On a lesser scale, it reminded me a little of the time Abyss went to Christian's house & tried to drown him in his backyard pool.<br>  <br>  6. Possibly, but I think it's more of a backdrop for Cena vs. Edge.
xKXu0Qb2aa	I am Not Even Joking , I Almost Threw Up....From Laughing So Hard.<br>  It was Almost TOO Good NOT to Believe.<br>  But Then I was Like , "Cena's Getting Married , & Even HE Wouldn't be THAT Perverted."<br>  <br>  I was Right about What He Said to Vickie on SD! Though (Sorta).<br>  I Thought He Said "I Like Bacon & Ribs..."<br>  Which , had He Really been in Love with Her , Would've Been Accurate...<br>  <br>  <br>  WQ - Lets Hope Not.<br>  Hopefully He Pulls a Jeff Hardy. "I'm Not going to Fight You."<br>  Plus Austin is Schelduled for RAW Next Week , So We're Most likely Looking at Y2J getting a Can of Whoop @ss Opened on Him...<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ - LMFAO.<br>  That's When I Literally Hit the Floor , & Almost Hurled.<br>  The @ss Slap was a Bit much...|`|IMu3wBu8aa	He did have me fooled. He is amazing on that mic. No doubt about it. <br>  <br>  WQ: Nope. I was hoping Austin would come back and kick @ss. We can only hope. We've seen so many legends...who's left...Austin or The Rock. The Rock doesn't technically exist anymore (Dwayne doesn't like The Rock anymore...) So Austin is the only choice left :)<br>  <br>  BQ: It was hilarious!! I was crying from laughing so hard during that whole thing. Especially, Cena!!|`|GgWrhISBaa	I know! I kinda just sat there for a Second with my mouth open,<br>  <br>  Maybe,,,,<br>  <br>  It was NASTY! lolololololol|`|86kZ5uYwaa	lol I was like c'mon Cena she's a nasty ho.<br>  <br>  Wq- Yeah<br>  <br>  Bq- Lol when she slapped his as* I was dying.|`|rseD4OG2aa	I know exactly what you mean, I couldn't believe it when I saw it. At first, I thought it was just a joke, which it thankfully turned out to be, but as it went on and Cena didn't break down at all, I was like:<br>  "Oh man, please don't veer off into the stupidest storyline of the year."<br>  Cena did a terrific job on the mic, and last night only further proved that he's one of, if not the best in the business. Not to many guys could have pulled that off last night. He was somehow able to keep a straight face throughout the entire thing and he told the truth at the perfect moment. <br>  He really did have me fooled for a moment. I was relieved and surprised when he finally let the cat out of the bag. <br>  It's a good thing he did to, because that would have been the worst storyline ever...|`|AA11528760	Yes. And, I also thought that Cena might be finally going for a heel-turn by aligning with Vickie. He's really wonderful at promo-work.<br>  <br>  WQ: No. They'll probably tease a match for Flair by bringing him out in his wrestling attire. But, it is very likely that Austin will show up to defend Flair. Plus, the date is also perfect for Austin's return - 3/16.<br>  <br>  BQ: Awkwardly funny. I don't know why, but Show & Vickie reminded me of Henry & Mae Young .|`|173d1e474e682e11c4fcd5db60da1da3aa	nope I knew better than to believe something that Cena says <br>  <br>  WQ: hell no I hope not<br>  <br>  BQ: I thought Edge took it pretty damn well! it was gross in my opinion though I saw it coming but I didn't want it to happen that's how unpleasant it was for me personally.  if i was in the unfortunate position Vickie has "put herself" in I choose to stay with Edge!|`|KWtjVW9saa	I thought he was serious too, especially after he left the ring. I give him allot of credit for keeping a straight face.The security video was funny, Big Show trying to be sneaky (come one who is not going to notice him) and the spank on the butt priceless!!! Did you notice that Vicky and Show had a hard time keeping a serious face?|`|oWJU0ky4aa	I knew he was only joking hes a riot isn't he. Thats why I like him so much cause he can do that and look that serious. People could hear me all the way down the hall I was so loud. I think Edge and Vicky will make up though.After all, do yo you remember what he did to her the night before the wedding.|`|3uo1VPjtaa	Haha. Yes, I didn't believe him when he first said it, but then i started to wonder lmao. <br>  <br>  I think he will eventually.<br>  <br>  Lmao! That was pretty halarious. Yes, it was really awkard lmao.|`|5xK9Kz94aa	i could take cena|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	OMG I can't wait to watch it tomorrow! I wish it was live here in Australia like it is in the U.S =(|`|VBfhoqS3aa	I just thougt, maybe a heel turn for Cena? Then when I saw the Vickie and Show video I laughed abit. Look how much Show had to bend down! Imagine she was in her wheelchair.<br>  <br>  WQ: No<br>  <br>  WQ: LOL|`|NRs72Afxaa	I sort of knew Cena in love with Vickie was fake, but when Cena didn't show any face expressions I thought he was serious.  I was worried their for second Wwe creative really lost...wait I think I'm too late.  After that segment I thought it was going to end it like that, and when Edge interrupted I knew he was bluffing but it was a good trick.<br>  <br>  Everybody might hate him with his Gimmick and Wrestling ability, but you cannot deny his mic skills.<br>  <br>  WQ: I would love to see it happen, but I think Ric Flair is going to intraduce Chris Jericho WM opponet. I hope its Stone Cold Steve Austin.<br>  <br>  BQ: I thought it was disturbing and funny. The smack in the butt gave me a future prediction that wwe might go with a love storyline with Big Show and Vickie. Now that what I call "Beauty and the Beast gone wrong".

I'd want to name it something that identified with the local history and culture of the city.   <br>  <br>  For instance, I would love to own a team in Portland, Oregon.  I would want to provide them with a name that carried the culture and history of the city, while at the same time being respectful of the tradition of the NFL.  Something simple, but also something that was unique and exemplified power.  Perhaps the Oregon Volcanoes would be ideal.

ZbNXVQu7aa	There's only one thing preventing me from enjoying this particular story line: Vickie's last name.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, the Guerrero name shouldn't have had to go through a story line like this, but I'm doing what I can to grin and bear it.<br>  <br>  One thing that helps is how funny John Cena can be, and another thing that helps is how unlikely a pairing Vickie Guerrero and Big Show are, but the thing that helps most of all is keeping in mind how much better this story line is now compared to how it was before Big Show was added to it.|`|oWJU0ky4aa	I was laughing so hard people down the hall could hear me.I kept hitting my legs also for some reason and they were all red and I couldn't stop scratching them.It was the best!|`|ULSUqmeZaa	I still don't think the match will be that interesting but I like the storyline around it. <br>  <br>  BQ: Yes|`|CC3FZj9Caa	ur actually enjoying this? woooow...thats all i can say.|`|173d1e474e682e11c4fcd5db60da1da3aa	yeah <br>  I think that it was meant to be payback for the whole Alicia Fox thing but (as usual I might add) it kinda blew up in Vickie's face  I reckon Edge will be staying heel because that's what he does best but he'll make Vickie choose either she stays "married" to him and never sees Big Show again or they get "divorced" and she leaves Smackdown with Big Show (i would choose to stay with Edge!)<br>  <br>  BQ: i felt really sorry for Edge... although now he knows how Vickie "felt" when Triple H revealed the video of him and Alicia (ok ok I admit it i felt sorry for both Edge and Vickie cos they're my favorite couple on WWE tv *blushes*)<br>   I don't like Cena that much although the comment he made the other week about the 400lb monster was kind of funny <br>  I am not going into why it was tasteless and disrespectful|`|Ks01Fa7Raa	i didnt enjoy it very much<br>  im not a big cena fan i found it a lil lame<br>  but thats just me|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	i am enjoying it too :D|`|NZKramllaa	Yeah, It gives us a break from seeing the same Edge and Vicki concepts over and over again.

I actually thought Cena was in love with Vickie and that hey were going for a love square thing. Then Cena turns and admits the truth. "Vickie you've got some splainin to do" funniest Cena quote yet.
khU8m4gxaa	While I think that has potential to be a pretty good match, I wouldn't anticipate it since they're both heels. The fans would have no one to cheer for & you don't want to confuse a crowd into being quiet during the biggest show of the year. I could see a defense against Mysterio. Or possibly they throw us a curveball and put him in against Evan Bourne. It'll be interesting to see what unfolds.|`|ePvvGUu3aa	I think it also would be a great match as Regal is a technical wrestler, whereas Bradshaw is more of the brawler type. I always thought those two styles go into sync well together. As another user pointed out, it will be hard due to they are both heels and it's something we won't usually see at a Mania event. <br>  <br>  Back to the question, I would enjoy watching this match as both are in ring veterans and have the styles I enjoy (more on the technical side). This match is reasonable as Regal has held the Intercontinental Championship before and added some more credit to that belt in the past. I can only imagine if he were to get some of the best active former Intercontinental Champions together to wrestle him and beat all of them in one night.<br>  <br>  I guess some secondary choices can be Rey Mysterio or Evan Bourne. As I posted, I guess any active or former champion from the past or something.|`|41WXZPnCaa	Ohhhhh Yeah<br>  <br>  Will Be Cool<br>  <br>  Obviusly If The Match Is Good Booked But If <br>  <br>  Its Booked Like Santino vs Regal In England Or Regal vs Finlay GAB 2006<br>  <br>  Best Put JBL vs Rey|`|3d9d6884d0874ab328f3fd0d9774f48eaa	It would be a great match, but people wont appreciate it.

That sounds like it could be a good match.|`|WCX6kYITaa	Get real. Even though Regal and JBL are both heels, JBL is American after all. Guess who'll get the cheers! <br>  <br>  But in my personal opinion, JBL is too big a heel to contend such a minor title. Yes, the IC title is relatively minor. That's why you don't see Y2J, Jeff Hardy, etc contest it anymore.|`|5ryXoxtVaa	JBL Vs. Montel Vontavious Porter But Smackdown Has 5/9 Champions.<br>  So Maybe JBL Vs. Rey Mysterio Vs. William Regal|`|6ueL0gkAaa	502 has a good point. Both guys are heels and the crowd would be dead for the match. Id rather see JBL go up against a babyface.|`|oWJU0ky4aa	Thats a great idea but I wouldn't know who to root for.There both jerks.|`|VlvektSJaa	Nah.<br>  <br>  I would assume Rey to challenge JBL for the IC title.|`|m68HTA4paa	how about rey mysterio? as of now, i don't think he's in a match.

wnbiRwSKaa	Adebayor and Eduardo- it's tough|`|Rgakh8V5aa	No doubt, it has to be Adebayor. However, Robbie van Persie is also equally good. Last year, Adebayor scored 30 goals in all competitions. Although he hasn't been so good this season, I am sure he will be even better at the season's end. Also, Adebayor was Africa's Player of the Year 2008. What more do you need?<br>  <br>  If you are asking all time, the the best striker is Thierry henry [no doubt].|`|17HJIXycaa	Once Eduardo gets back into shape and plays a few more games everyone will remember he is their best striker.|`|F3faAmsSaa	Robin VanPersie Or Adebayor|`|Oj9ITMSFaa	This season RVP. But all the others are top class.|`|KR3IvxNwaa	from all of those i would say Eduardo. he is a true finisher ! a real striker as well,, not like Adebayor who usually missed a sitter.<br>  <br>  but this season i have to go with Bendtner. under all the critics he was facing at,, he proved it wrong on West Brom's match last week.<br>  <br>  Van Persie is great as well. but he can't play with Bendtner. he needs someone like Eduardo. hopefully Wenger will put Eduardo and Van Persie together up front at Roma.|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	Eduardo has a goal per game ratio, not only for Arsenal but for Croatia and when he was playing in Dinamo, Adebayor had ONE above average season (arsenal didn0t win nothing) when Eduardo is havin great CAREER......

vOBZPDgcaa	I wish i still thought it was real. All the matches and story lines seemed so much better back then. it does get a little confusing when  u dont know whether to explain something in Kayfabe or just how its seen on tv. <br>  <br>  p.s- to call wrestling fake would be like calling The Terminator fake.

Understanding it's scripted and explaining why the script works are different things.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	You answered your own question!<br>  It's scripted.<br>  Jeff and Matt don't hate each other, they are working a story.<br>  If the police were going to arrest wrestlers for real, no one would be around to wrestle...<br>  The only thing really real about the Orton/HHH thing is the fact that Orton TRULY hates HHH<br>  <br>  EDIT: Opps my bad...had one eye on the TV   :)|`|PfF1ufDoaa	Everyone over the age of 10 should have figured out that it is scripted.

H8u7gMAYaa	I really think so. he gives us such a strong presence in the paint. He is much bigger and stronger than Pau. So when Bynum comes back it moves Pau back to his normal position at PF. And also moves Odom back to his normal position at SF where he can really be versatile.<br>  <br>  He also helps our defense alot as well by shot blocking and just another 7'0 280lbs to get by in order to score.<br>  <br>  I just hope when he comes back this year that he will atleast be good enough to ensure our defense up. We don't need him to score points, just rebound and block shots.|`|UYPfC5YVaa	The Lakers needed Bynum in the center spot. Pau Gasol is comfortable playing the power forward position. Though it's just a regular season loss, they better be prepared come playoff time, because other teams would definitely take advantage of that weak spot in the Lakers. Just hope that Bynum would still be strong and would not again injured once he comes back. Still, the Lakers squad are the team to beat in the postseasons.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	Team Defense is the key for the Lakers<br>  <br>  Sure Bynum will improve their defense, but he want make it "elite"<br>  <br>  EXP. Marcus Camby, on the Nuggets. Great Defensive Center, yet the Nuggets were still a horrible defensive team.<br>  <br>  Lakers need to play tough, and focus on team defense. They are the best offensive team in the league, but they can't expect to outscore every team, every night.|`|bRlF0U8Jaa	lol don't worry lakers fan if bynum returns the lakers will dominate again especially in the playoffs and in the finals so lakers haters back off,to boston bandwagoners didn't you chanting mvp to kobe bryant before the 06-07 season ends?when the lakers play at your home?c'mon|`|BFOOOzwBaa	they dont need him at this moment but during the playoffs they still might not need him because hes gonna be a little rusty and it might make the lakers drift down but if he comes back fresh and is doing good his first 2 games it is for sure he will be the answer|`|N5Cnuay0aa	Yes, with Bynum the Lakers are better. doesn't mean we need him now, we are still best team record wise let Bynum heal and be ready for the playoffs.|`|Vx9Lvt9Aaa	omg dude i walk in to my room pop on the tube and trial blazers are destroying lalkersssss...i dont know what to thinkk mannn im so upsettt|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Agree with you<br>  <br>  pau isn't a good defender,you need A-Train|`|bcdda81b9d8d3b625f85a27ddaee6592aa	Have any of you seen bynum play when he is angry.  The mean face gets going and he is strong enough to barrel over players.

If Bynum didn't get hurt last year, I think they could've beat the Celtics in the finals or at pushed the series to 7 games.  With Kobe, two legit low post scorers and defenders in Gasol and Bynum and a very talented supporting cast, the lakers are clearly the NBA's most talented team.  Without Bynum, they're still good.  But I don't think they're good enough to win the championship.|`|P93I8CHtaa	bynum is the answer! and the reason why we lost today|`|MTbgg5eyaa	Definitely. We are better offensively without Andrew Bynum. But defensively? Nope.<br>  <br>  Points in the paint has been raining over Pau Gasol. Everyone can dunk on Gasol. Anyone can do a layup drill over the 7-foot Spaniard.<br>  <br>  Not that I think he is soft, he just isn't able to block and defend the rim better than Drew.<br>  <br>  Technically speaking, Pau isn't as good of a help defender as Drew is. Pau isn't good at rotating to another defender as he just tries to stay put on one player only. Drew is a good help defender on the weak side because of his ability to get to the defender faster than Pau can. He is more athletic as well.|`|8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	What up L07,<br>  <br>  It's a tough question.  i think the Lakers have not had enough time to see how good they truly can be when fully healthy.  Andrew has shown the potential to be a consistent double-double guy and even a future all-star when healthy and when he gets enough touches of the ball.<br>  <br>  Being a player of that caliber- it is fair to say that any team is better with Andrew Bynum.  i mean even if he's not back at 100% just having him to come off the bnehc gives the Lakers more depth and toughness. And there are games that you mentioned where Bynum's presence would have helped the Lakers (especially on the defensive side of the ball).  <br>  <br>  i'm not sure he's the answer- but he's most certainly a part of the answer. The Lakers have so much offensive fire power and depth that when they play great team defense- they're awfully difficult to beat.  i'm glad we'll have him back for the playoffs- because it just makes the Lakers that much harder to beat in a 7 game series.<br>  <br>  Nickster|`|fuYYRJXtaa	Answer to a better team - Yes.<br>  <br>  Answer to losing against other Centers - No.<br>  <br>  When Bynum scored 40+ against the Clippers, the Clippers had no Chris Kaman, or Camby... So Bynum took advantage... But Bynum is still young and has many time to improve.  He's not a big factor in the Lakers success, but a good one... In 2 or 3 years Bynum will be an All Star Center and will be a major part of the Lakers success.  For now, Gasol, Kobe, Odom, and Fisher have to step up it up a notch till he returns.|`|NGYoZs1Kaa	thats what people said the last time he got hurt . and what did he do ? he played soft , not all tough like everyone thought .
I1w0HfQbaa	There are a few fights which I have on my classic Boxing DVD collection which I think were pretty good but unlikely to receive the attention it deserves due to the bad reputations of the combatants. One fight which I especially enjoyed was Andrew Golota vs. Chris Byrd for the IBF Heavyweight title which was when Golota was having a bit of a resurging career. It had good back-and-forth action and Golota backing Byrd up against the ropes and scoring at will; even when he wasn't landing he was building up points. Byrd using his quick counterpunches and his shoulder roll and his defense to keep Golota at bay. Their fighting styles meshed extremely well together and it turned out to be a surprisingly good fight. <br>  <br>  Another fight which was pretty good was Bruce Seldon vs. Tony Tucker for another alphabet soup title which was on the undercard of Oliver McCall vs. Larry Holmes. Though McCall-Holmes was the main event this fight stole the show. It was a nice, crisp boxing match which saw Tucker, though 36 years of age, show a lot of determination in his last hurrah at the Heavyweight gold. He landed some good right hand shots which staggered Seldon but Seldon stuck to his game plan. Between rounds three to four Seldon's corner man told him not to slug it out with Tucker and Seldon did what was asked. He stuck to that lethal jab of his and started working on Tucker's left eye. The jab kept on having an effect and by the end of the seventh round the swelling got so bad that the ringside doctor advised ref Mills Lane to stop the fight. Tucker was on his stool complaining bitterly about the stoppage but I agreed with the doctor and ref's decision. It was a pretty good fight which stole the show.|`|dh48AkbCaa	ligher weight fighters such as vic darchenian and roman gonzalez.|`|AA12325046	Cunningham vs Adamsak was a great fight and so was Marquez vs Pacquiao.

And truth be told, I have seen some of his fights with Mike Williams and Tony Tucker and feel 42-1 odds stacked against him on that fateful night in Tokyo was kinda absurd. He was a well educated boxer who had good ring generalship, a snappy left jab, good footwork, good head movement, nice footwork and unusually quick hands for a man his size. If only he knew how to keep his weight in check. <br>  <br>  I like Mike Weaver as the greatest underdog story in boxing. He was an underdog because he was a good fighter but kinda limited as a boxer but despite his limitations and a mediocre record he was able to accomplish quite a lot during the course of his career. After beginning his career with two losses to Howard Smith a lot of boxers would just call it quits but Weaver resiliency was admirable: he persevered and kept on boxing. He received a title shot against the great Larry Holmes and gave Holmes a tough outing: even hurting Holmes briefly to the body before getting knocked down in the eleventh round and succumbing to Holmes in the twelfth round in a tough fight. Let's not forget his 15th round come from behind KO of John Tate. Trailing on all the scorecards he hit Tate with everything he had. And with about a minute left to go in the final rounds and Tate backed up against the ropes Weaver nailed him with a left hook which knocked him out cold. For any boxing fans who want to bring back 15 round fights point to this example and Leonard-Hearns I as examples of why those three extra rounds should be brought back.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Thumbs up to maurice, he nailed this one, it was a pleasure just to read his answers.<br>  <br>  I will add:<br>  Iran Barkley over Hearns<br>  Estaban DeJesus over Duran<br>  Bonecrusher Smith over Witherspoon<br>  Doug DeWhitt over James Toney<br>  Frankie Randel over Chavez
I1w0HfQbaa	The greats are the ones which learn from their mistakes the first time around and when they have a difficult time against an opponent can admit they made a mistake and change game plans because they know what they did before will not work with this opponent's fighting style so they change game plans and perform even better the second time around than they do the first. <br>  <br>  Azumah Nelson is the one who fairs incredibly well in the rematch. Remember his first fight with Jeff Fenech in 1991? Fenech did enough to win that fight and many ringside observers felt he was robbed of a fourth world title. In the rematch Azumah pulled off an upset and knocked out Fenech with relative ease before the ref stopped it in the eight. He had two difficult fights with Jesse James Leija but in the third fight of their four fight installment he knocked Leija out in definitive fashion--taking him out in the sixth round. He pulled off a majority win over Gabriel Ruelas and then in the rematch when most boxing writers felt he should have hung up the gloves, at the ripe old age of 37 knocked out and picked apart the much younger Ruelas in five rounds. <br>  <br>  Evander Holyfield is another fighter which comes to mind. When he lost a majority decision to Michael Moorer the thinking here was after he should have hung up the gloves. Especially after it was found out he had a heart condition. But in the rematch he thoroughly dominated Moorer, knocking him down in the fifth, seventh and eight rounds winning by TKO in round 8 of what was one of his finest performances. He also fought a smart fight against Riddick Bowe in the rematch to regain his World Heavyweight title. It was an entertaining rematch fraught with the now infamous fan man incident in the seventh round. But Holyfield kept his focus and was able to out-box an overweight Riddick to become a two-time Champion.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Great question, most of the classics envolving Ali (Frazier, Norton & Spinks) are already mentioned.  <br>  <br>  Humberto Gonzales beat Michael Carbajal in the rematch after getting KOed in their first fight.<br>  <br>  Jose Luis Castillo got KOed against Deigo Corrales in their classic, but won the rematch.<br>  <br>  Chavez avenged his lost against Frankie Randel, but not as convincingly as some would have liked.<br>  <br>  Marvin Hagler lost to Willie Monroe, the won both rematches.<br>  <br>  Lewis vs McCall & Rockmon, Patterson vs Johannson have already been mentioned, but deserve to be on this list.<br>  <br>  Wladimir Klitschko avenged his loss to Lamont Brewster, and even got a measure of revenge for his brother Vitali by beating Chris Byrd.<br>  <br>  Last but not least, Thomas Hearns did well enough in his rematch to deserve a victory over Ray Leonard, but two knockdowns and 12 rounds of domination only netted him a draw in the record books.  Ray had a way with the judges that always seemed slanted in his favor.|`|AA12325046	The first fighter that comes to mind for me as doing better in the rematch is Joe Louis.  After Max Schmeling knocked him out in 12 rounds in 1936, Joe of course blitzed Max in one round in the rematch.<br>  <br>  The next fighter that comes to mind for me is Floyd Patterson who was knocked out by Ingemar Johansson in 3 rounds, won the rematch with one of the best left hooks ever thrown.<br>  <br>  Sugar Ray Robinson was always winning rematches and two come to mind for me are after losing the middleweight title to Gene Fullmer, Robinson knocked Fullmer out with a perfect left hook that Fullmer doesn't remember to this day.  Also Ray lost his title to Randy Turpin by shocking decision, and beat Turpin in the rematch.<br>  <br>  Tony Zale and Rocky Graziano are well known for their fight trilogy.  In the 1st fight Zale came roaring from behind to stop Rocky.  In the rematch, Graziano turned the table, winning by kayo.|`|dh48AkbCaa	muhammad ali avenged his first three losses (two of them twice) and ray robinson  won every rematch (except lamotta 2, but gained revenge there) up to paul pender.<br>  <br>  joe louis as well, see buddy baer, abe simon, arturo godoy and schmelling|`|TbEwkoQDaa	The match between Rahman and Lewis.  In their first match, Rahman KOed Lewis but the rematch was opposite story as Lewis came to punish and knock out Rahman to regain his belts.|`|910875de6723862c69bd16bf9f5b2249aa	Joe Louis was better the second time he faced Schmeling|`|PHShxDxUaa	Ali - Frazier, Ali lost their first fight and was knocked down in the 15th round, Ali cameback and won the rematch, and stopped Frazier in their third and last meet.  <br>  <br>  Paul williams - Carlos quintana, Quintana outboxed williams in their first meet and won UD, in the rematch Williams knocked Quintana out in the first round !<br>  <br>  There are other but right now those are the ones that come to mind.|`|srp02clAaa	Manny Pacquiao against Erik Morales. Remember, their first bout was the last defeat of Manny.

That's just what great teams do, they may lose but they will come out strong the next game. What we did wrong was we couldn't stop Portland from hitting the threes. On offense we also were inconstant,. Whenever it seemed we were gonna come back into the game we had trouble scoring. But it's all right man, don't let it affect your homework. We still have the best record in the NBA and we'll be ready to play Wednesday. Good luck on your homework.|`|kZuktZ3iaa	i didn't see the entire first half. passed out, drugged up, wisdom teeeth out bleH!<br>  but i'd assume its the same reason that always gets them into trouble.<br>  <br>  they didn't play defense. for some reason the lakers are under the impression they can win games consistantly if they play like 10 minutes of defense in a 48 minute game.|`|b2qdwABVaa	I couldn't finish my homework either =[.<br>  <br>  The Lakers were outhustled tonight by far.  Every guy on the squad got blown past on the first step.  No one in the paint as a secondary defender leads to open layups all night.

I knew that the Blazers are amazing at home and tonight was no exception. They played well and that's fine.<br>  <br>  What is bothering me so much right now is our players.

nRBC4E5saa	You can find tons of great material for "World Martial Arts".  They have training videos by Marcelo Garcia (BJJ), Mike Swain (Judo), Karo Parisyan (MMA judo), the Rua brothers (MMA), Mario Sperry (Vale Tudo and submission wrestling), Tony Cecchine (Catch Wrestling), Kevin Jackson/Mike Van Arsdale (wrestling takedowns), Eduardo Telles (BJJ), Duke Roufus (Muay Thai), plus other BJJ and Sambo guys who's names escape me now.<br>  <br>  A few years ago Century put out a series of videos entitled "Learn to Fight and Win".  Each one was a six-tape series featuring the following MMA fighters: Jens Pulver, Pat Miletich, Dan Henderson, Randy Couture, and Frank Shamrock.  Also good stuff.<br>  <br>  I know there are also videos out there by Chuck Liddell, Tito Ortiz, Shonie Carter, Eric Schaffer, Denis Kang, GSP, and Josh Barnett.  They cover, in part or in whole, the various aspects of MMA.<br>  <br>  Erik Paulson, who's a well known MMA coach, has put out several videos on his Combat Submission Wrestling system, including things like takedowns and various holds.<br>  <br>  Mark Hatmaker focuses on Western systems, but has very solid material.  It's generally MMA oriented material, but sometimes focuses on specific disciplines (boxing, submission wrestling).<br>  <br>  If you go on wrestling equipment websites, they usually have instructional videos as well, focusing usually on takedowns.  Likewise, Everlast has a few boxing instructionals.<br>  <br>  Eddie Bravo's "10th Planet" Jiujitsu system is on the cutting edge of competitive BJJ.  Check out his Rubber Guard material.<br>  <br>  I'm also a fan of Stephan Kestin, who puts out some very easy-to-follow BJJ/grappling instructionals.<br>  <br>  If you can find anything by Darrel Gholar (sp?), he was an Olypic level judo and Greco-Roman guy.  He was even employed by Brazilian Top Team as their wrestling instructor.<br>  <br>  You can also check out material from the Straight Blast Gym.  I've got their "street boxing" and "hardcore training" MMA material, but I've also heard good things about their BJJ stuff.<br>  <br>  Finally, Scott Sonnon, a Sambo guy, has recently released a video on "The Saddle", a positional game for leg locks.  I already had a pretty good leg lock game, but after that video my % has gone up.<br>  <br>  There are other systems out there, of course, but based on your initial question, I think this was the direction you were heading.|`|xQ6KwzhMaa	Here's a great video you might like.

4Td7hgqBaa	My tips might not get to you quick enough to help for this training session but they might help with others. If your coach swears at his players then put a formal complaint in. This behavior won't help anyone play football. Now at eleven years of age us coaches expect you to make mistakes then we work at correcting them with positive feedback and correct practical demonstrations. Look, learn and listen and just enjoy yourself. Deep breath and relax and go with the flow until your skills improve. I'm sure that your new coach will help and encourage you and dress the part at training sessions as well as games. Best of luck.|`|5XltfLhTaa	I agree that if your coach starts swearing to you, put a formal complaint up. You are only 11, football at this age should only be about having fun.<br>  <br>  The coaches will give you some simple tips and drills, nothing difficult. They then let you play and they scout those that are able to understand their trainings, apply it correctly, and has good potential. <br>  <br>  The important thing is, to have fun. Once you have fun, you will be able to play more relaxed and comfortably. And that usually results in you playing a good game!|`|zVYZVY9Uaa	dont be scared . its fun okay|`|zGDkO3yUaa	ok just relax! I know how ya feel....sometimes it can be intimidating. Just be confident and watch what ur doing. If the coach is being like that then it might be good to go to another team that you feel better with. Your only 11 for crying out.

B46t8gkLaa	not at all. talent is talent. height has nothing to do with it.|`|V9dRZyUtaa	Yes as your centre of gravity is lower.|`|PHamImDsaa	Surfing has nothing to do with how tall or short you are. But all the pros on the "Men's ASP" like eg Kelly Slater (9 times world champ) Mick Fanning, Tom Carrol (surfing great) are no bigger than 5'4 and then there is Andy Irons (4 times ASP Champ),Bobby Matrinez and lots mpore that are 6'0 and still keep up with the field. But NO it does not make surfing easier if your shorter. If you were overweight than that's a different story.|`|xo5rqZ2Caa	Height isnt really a factor it would be harder to get small barrels but it doesnt stop you weight is the thing that can stop you thats why surfers train really well and keep fit, So no height doesnt matter at all.|`|H1wIepV8aa	it doesn't matter.<br>  if you are taller then you get a longer board if you are shorter then a shorter board,<br>  but its not big deal really.|`|1f323a9d4b92c97b39b9d4358be7bf15aa	height doesnt matter<br>  weight does<br>  the lighter u are the better

He carried the Spurs when Manu and Tony were out.<br>  <br>  Brandon Roy and Carmelo Anthony are my other options.|`|7RBdjcl2aa	Tim Duncan but Chris Paul will win|`|xtuyRToAaa	Two players are neck and neck for the MVP this season: Wade and Lebron.<br>  <br>  I pick Wade, he's great overall than Lebron.

JcojiZRiaa	Draft|`|Nuj1eScCaa	Well, I suppose that the team would have to continue playing until the end of the season, because everyone is under contract. After that the franchise is eliminated and all rights to it are either bought out or relocated.<br>  <br>  The players would then be eligible for an expansion draft in that offseason.|`|HIfs0vgzaa	When a team folds, the team has to buyout their contracts and they become unrestricted free agents.|`|BFOOOzwBaa	naw ya wrong the team will stay together they will just be relocated|`|QlcGYKs4aa	they all become unrestricted free agents and can sign with any team.|`|0Dx3pBVEaa	they would become free agents.
rLDliBefaa	I always thought when you retired you were done!!! WTF is with all these athletes who keep coming out of retirement?<br>  Ric Flair should stay home and leave us w/ the good memories we have of him.|`|JC06fESWaa	I agree with you in that he's old and should just relax and shouldn't wrestle. But if he does come back  no other wrestler ever gave more to the game so he can doe what ever he wants to|`|AA10557416	yes one night to kick jericos ***|`|VBfhoqS3aa	Why is he back.|`|aYnduRsxaa	As much as I love Ric Flair, no! I agree with you, he needs to stay out of the ring. If he comes back for even one night, then his retirement match with Shawn Michaels meant NOTHING.|`|pKX0lfMzaa	I doubt he will return to the ring, I just don't see that happening. I do think he will come out just to do a promo to tease a potential opponent of Jericho or just come out to do a promo to further the storyline. If Ric came back as interim General Manager, that would actually be a great job or at least something out of the wrestling ring. As I mentioned, I doubt he will return to the ring. It would be disappointing to see him come out of his farewell match because it would seem as if it was all for nothing. To answer shortly, no I don't want to see him back in the ring.|`|XdQYUC2paa	He should not come back to wrestle he had a good send off<br>  <br>  It would be OK if he came back to be a manager|`|qpb8l4Mkaa	No... please no...|`|yEsw7UkWaa	NO!!!<br>  We just got rid of him for goodness sake!
FUoKu13Daa	I am going with 1-2,  I think houston is on a roll right now and will be looking out for a big game from Kobe and Artest and Battier will work hard to slow him down,  But I think they will lose that game or if it is a tough game and they do win they might be tired for the Spurs the next night.|`|fuYYRJXtaa	They're not winning against a Hot Rockets team.

NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!<br>  <br>  Sachin must play ODIs till the 2011 Cricket World Cup and must retire after that. Hopefully he will retire with India as world champions. He should stop playing Test cricket by the end of next year at latest. OMG! Sachin still has it! That 163 against NZ proves that the greatest cricketer in history is far from done. Some bad karma stopped him from getting the double-hundred but Tendulkar is the closest thing to a god of cricket [EVER!!!] so if anyone gets the double hundred it will be most likely him!|`|Ezk53Ifmaa	Yes. 20 years of wear and tear would have taken a huge toll on his body. I think he should limit himself to Test Matches only.|`|i8QoeiNyaa	He should play few odi games and as many tests as possible.<br>  <br>  Good advice, good question.<br>  **starred**|`|Pb9TjXVUaa	i agree with bond.players get injured while playing tests also.but for an injury one must not restrict himself to any one format of the game.but if the player need some rests due to frequent matches(specially ODIs r frequent) then he may restrict.<br>  but i don't think sachin should retire as he is still fit enough to play in all the three formats|`|bN6S0FJEaa	You mean players doesn't get injured in Test Cricket?<br>  Have you seen day before yesterday Gayle got injured, In SA v Aus, Smith got injured and out of the series.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is "as long as Sachin is fit and in form, he can and he should play all formats of the game"|`|SdOUTvQWaa	yes he should restrict himself to test cricket so that he can score more runs in test...........and it is good to him and also for india|`|q8u6u49faa	No, because he is playing from so many years and some years of bad form should not stop him.|`|AA12011786	shut up now........he's the best odi player produced till now....dont talk of this ever|`|558ff4ba8e7d33a8220d4cc8b1701f56aa	No, he knows what to do much better than us.|`|iDmjwU26aa	no........
3tSMTwGraa	Each has his own style so it is like comparing apple and orange.|`|9d2aOK36aa	good as in competitive fighting? yes, maybe because he is younger than all of them and has a more realistic fighting style<br>  <br>  but he isn't as famous when it comes to being an actor.<br>  <br>  acting: Jackie Chan> Jet Li > Tony Jaa > Donnie Yen( whoever he is)<br>  <br>  fighting: Tony Jaa > Jet Li > Jackie Chan > Donnie Yen( whoever he is)|`|4ca485ab10aead5ea4089df6e7d8f86aaa	Jet Li's primary martial arts background is in contemporary wushu, which is focused almost exclusively on exhibition, not fighting.<br>  Jackie Chan's primary martial arts background is from a Peking opera company: somewhat more traditional and rough-and-tumble than wushu, but still predominantly focused for show, not fighting.<br>  Donnie Yen comes from a family known for its legitimate, fighting-focused traditional internal martial arts, and experimented with a large variety of martial arts before finally settling on wushu. He'd probably be the best at actual fighting of any of the three.<br>  <br>  Tony Jaa has a dual background in wushu and Muay Thai. Muay Thai is very much focused for practical fighting: it is the antithesis of contemporary wushu, extremely practical.<br>  <br>  In short: None of the above three have competition records in the ring, so it's impossible to tell: but it's a virtual certainty that Jaa was hit hard, and hit other people hard, during his training: a virtual certainty that Jet did not: a good bet that Jackie did not: and Donnie Yen probably didn't do as much of it. That means that he's far more likely to be good at actual fighting than any of the three Hong Kong stars.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	You mean his choreography skills? Well, I think Donnie Yen is the best in that field. Quite frankly if you don't know who Donnie Yen is then you're not a fan of kung fu flicks.<br>  <br>  In all honesty, whilst I think Tony Jaa is pretty close to them, the others are simply in a different league. But he's got plenty of time to improve. He's only just started his career.|`|xQ6KwzhMaa	Pretty sure all of them specialise more in stunts and acrobatics than actual fighting. However, I believe that Tony Jaa has trained properly in Muay Thai before, so I assume he'd be the best.|`|6p9I889Iaa	None of them fight.  They're all performance artists.|`|KbxPl1oYaa	They are all masters at the martial art of special effects.
HJzZIwTiaa	i bet for kuya donaire syempre...<br>  he studied the technique of darchinyan<br>  when they first match...<br>  and if you rematch them again<br>  definetly donaire will win again..<br>  darchinyan's moves is too rascal<br>  thats why he loose...<br>  and kuya donaire's moves naman is<br>  too wise (wais) too good (magaling)<br>  he knows darchinyan's next step<br>  thats why he beat darchinyan easily..|`|rhgVEXkDaa	Im sorry im picking donaire. In fact, i thought he was too strong for Darchinyan because donaire moved down from super fly weight. Donaire just has the boxing skills to beat darchinyan, the only improvement ive seen from darchinyan is his jab, and patience, but he still fights the same way.|`|R5G9h2ygaa	Definetely Darchinyan. He would be far more weary against Donaire if they were to fight again. Since the loss Vic has learnt from his mistakes and not looked back, by contrast i saw Donaire's last bout against an unknown African fighter, Donaire looked brilliant for the first four rounds but then looked in all sorts of trouble in the sixth round but was saved when a cut on the opponent caused by a punch allowed Donaire to win by TKO.<br>  In this light I would imagine that Darchinyan would be far more patient the second time around and would begin to get on top of Donaire in the middle rounds, leading to a late round KO in about the 10th round
yauOABy3aa	umm sorry i have no idea which one will win but i love the pulsar.............cuz i know someone in india who has it.........and i <3 that person......hehe.........yeah i think that the pulsar would win...........but sorry i couldn't answer ur question fully......... :D|`|rfxRQCUWaa	Thats a weird combination of racers.. Well anyways, puttin emphasis on the distance.. a 500m race.. Which is a little less to actually understand the true worth of the bikes, the answer is as explained below.<br>  <br>  The thunderbird, has the highest cubic capacity of 350cc's. R15 is 150 cc and pulsar 220cc.<br>  <br>  The thunderbird is meant to be a cruiser, and is not made for speedy pick ups, but torque at top speeds. So there is no way the bullet, can win the 500m race.. Had that been a 5km race, then the thunderbird will sweep out..<br>  <br>  So lets concentrate on pulsar and R15. I believe, the R15 havin more bhp's and less weight than the 220cc engine of the pulsar, with a little less bhp than the yamaha, will make the yamaha win, but only in a 500m race. Just coz of the less weight than the pulsar. Had the race been 750 metres.. The pulsar would.. And if anythin over that, then the royal enfield.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|DrefPbOWaa	Thats a weird combination of racers.. Well anyways, puttin emphasis on the distance.. a 500m race..

As for him being or not being the next Manning, there's no way to tell right now, but he did have a MUCH better rookie season than Manning did, which is reason to be hopeful.|`|yg3Pveakaa	Manage the team and utilized every option he had..|`|DPlJiWyWaa	I recently bought his jersey as I was impressed with him as a a rookie.

Falcons are back in business I believe.|`|8wmjYlfaaa	I'd say the next Tom Brady.<br>  Maybe not all those Superbowl rings, but no doubt he'll have the talent that Brady has.He's going to be GREAT in a year or two.|`|gmZLGuNtaa	idk...<br>  seems like the<br>  atlanta falcons may be a "threat"<br>  not really...<br>  but they may do better than last season<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  GO STEELERS =)|`|WCHeU1Zlaa	the next Peyton Manning!|`|h2X7sNn6aa	I think that the falcons have alot to be excited about for the next 10 plus years. He played very well this year. And he did it with a lot less of a defence than Joe Flacco did. I think this will be a big year for him and the falcon. Lets hope he dosent have the sophomore jinx like alot of the young quarterbacks have in there careers.|`|wxHmXkGOaa	Matt Ryan will be a great QB for years to come. I expect him and Joe Flacco to have many battle's in the near future, maybe even for a superbowl. I expect for this two to become the next Brady and Manning over time.|`|yikZNA7aaa	A LOT of potential. It will be fun to watch him develop into the next truly great QB as Manning and Brady are heading into the back nine of their careers|`|GUjr6whNaa	Hes skilled but still unproven and still has a ways to go to become an Elite QB in the NFL but he has potential|`|YlBLz9lTaa	from what iv seen hes the next great QB in the nfl i dont know about Brady and Peyton Manning good but he could be Palmer and Brees good|`|vnzSTerjaa	better than joe flacco in my opinion, aww... i wish he didnt lose in the playoffs so i could have watched him longer! <3|`|IOpOEMnQaa	he has plenty of potential but so did Vince Young so lets just wait and see

tzrLDbHWaa	Right now, Kobe, by far.  Kobe can shoot, can score better, and is an overall better player.  Shaq's team isn't doing well this year, and with the likes of Nash, Stoudamire (for half the season) Hill, Richardson, he has no excuses of not having a supporting cast.  Kobe is the best player in the league, but Shaq can still be dominant if he gets the ball.|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	shaq dominated the early stages and during the 2000-time he left la, then kobe took over from there and kobe is better than shaq now.|`|Kx6W1or7aa	Right now, Kobe is clearly the better player.

fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	I suggest that you replace the chain. My guess is that it is probably original and a new one will improve performance significantly.<br>  <br>  While you do that take the time to completely clean and degrease, and lube the bike correctly- with the correct stuff. White lithium grease for all ball bearing surfaces, dedicated chain lube for the chain.<br>  <br>  By the way, our venerable friend from PBS is probably thinking a 10 gear cassette when he mentions "10 speed chains are not cheap". A chain for yours, a 1/2x3/32 chain, is quite cheap.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	If the chain is worn, replace it, but if you do, you will probably have to replace the freewheel as well. 10 speed chains are not expensive, and if you look around you will probably be able to find a replacement freewheel for a reasonable price, however, removing a freewheel requires a special tool, so you might have trouble changing it.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	You need a chain checker: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=18243&subcategory_ID=4204" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> this is a chain checker and you do not need to start taking links out of the chain until you check it for stretch first but since you say it is worn out then you should replace it and get one like this: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=23282&subcategory_ID=5134" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> Im guessing a bit on the chain but you say it is 10 speed. You dont need to get any of it from Performance but just get something similar and you can also go  to Pricepoint.com or any other one out there too that carries the same items. Ten speed chains are not cheap though and you would be wise to shop them around of course the one you get will depend on your specific group too. Also dont use that 3in1 oil anywhere on any bike use this one for general maintenance: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=565&subcategory_ID=4213" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> for cables and pivots and this one for your chain: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=18824&subcategory_ID=4213" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> all those "household remedies" for bikes is crap, use the proper tools and lubes and this bike will last you for years with proper maintenance!<br>  Edit: Bikework you are correct I was thinking as you stated....slow night for me last night.|`|oPbLcfKoaa	To your questions...<br>  <br>  Yes, the chain can be repaired, but when pushing out the rivet you don't push it ALL the way out. You reuse the old rivet on that age of chain. Newer chains vary whether you use the old one or replace it.<br>  <br>  Like bikeworks said, you'll be better off replacing the chain. You'll need a 1/2" x 3/32" chain for a 5 speed rear.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You can use a degreaser to get the gunk out with the chain still on the bike.  You can use a brush to get it really clean.  You can measure the chain to see how much it has worn.  This site should answer most of your questions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bicycletutor.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bicycletutor.com/</a>

268Rwp6zaa	Buy a box of clay targets. They should break if your gun has decent FPS.

Doubt your pistol is strong enough, though.
5GI6hmFpaa	If you are going to use your skates primarily for Roller Hockey, you should get hockey skates.<br>  <br>  They don't have a brake because it would be too easy to trip over it or be tripped by another person while in a game.<br>  <br>  The frames (what I think you are calling braces) on most fitness skates are also metal (plastic ones are only on the cheaper recreational skates).<br>  <br>  The big difference is that the hockey skates will tend to have smaller wheels and shorter frames to make you more maneuverable while playing hockey.

Also like 80% of the time when someone gets busted open that is real blood like HBK's eye injury and Orton getting opened up with the TV monitor from shane thats all real.|`|xqeTIXtfaa	according to me wwe stunts are scripted. they are trained to perform the stunts at right time. the match's results are fixed by the authorities and it is all FAKE.|`|ySfHzOdgaa	One of my best friends is an Indy wrestler in Australia and i've seen the stuff he goes through  - The storylines are scripted to keep it entertaining, the winners are, obviously predetermined and as for what happens in the ring, it hurts like hell, trust me i've seen him show up for stuff all cut up and bloody and it's not pretty. When your a wrestler you suck it up and wrestle through the pain, it's about keeping the fans happy.

Should both teams end with the same amount of losses (tied for the best record in the league) the Lakers having won both head-to-head matchups with the Cavs would own the tiebreaker and have homecourt advantage (assuming both teams make it through their respective conference playoffs to make it to the NBA finals).<br>  <br>  The Cavs have a slight inside track right now in that- the Lakers have more games remaining on the road- and so they'll have to step up to the challenge.

JV2mxI75aa	it would be best to ask this question at the end of the season|`|9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	It depends on what the MVP award actually means.  In the most literal sense, the MVP is the player who is most productive whose teams is  most dependent on him.  If that's the criteria, Wade should be MVP in this season thus far.<br>  <br>  However, for decades, who actually gets the MVP award is a player with great, though not league leading production, on an elite team with a good shot at the championship.  That's why Wilt Chamberlain wasn't MVP when he scored 50, Oscar Robertson wasn't MVP when he averaged a triple double for the entire season and Nate Archibald wasn't MVP when he was the only player to lead th league in scoring and assists in the same season.  In you place a great value on team record, LeBron James should be MVP.<br>  <br>  The people who vote for the award obviously favor the first criteria  (Pro Lebron).  t I think the second criteria (Pro Wade) determines he true MVP more accurately.  <br>  <br>  For the most part, I believe in the first criteria because it more accurately applies to the term "Most Valuable Player".  If you ask me, Wade should be the MVP frontrunner this year, either LeBron James or Chris Paul should've been MVP last year and Kobe Bryant, last season's MVP, shoud've gotten the award when he averaged 35 points per game in the 2005-2006 and lead an otherwise low talent to the playoffs.  <br>  <br>  As far as I'm concerned, all outstanding playe that leads their team to the playoffs, they should intially be given equal consideration for the MVP before the voters make their decision.  Currently, the MVP voting seems unfairly biased in favor of players on the most talented teams playing in big money markets.  The irony is that players on the most talented teams don't have to be as valuable to their teams in order for them to win because they have a high level supporting cast.<br>  <br>  MVP actually seems to be a misnomer.  It doesn't go to most valuable player but rather to the best player on a highly talented and/or major market team.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Dwyane Wade|`|Fh0shlVLaa	Wade. He's getting loads of points and NOT selfish like James or Kobe. You ever see Kobe score a lot and get 10+ assists? Haha, no way.

If you have followed the Cavs at all this year you would know that Lebron's minutes are down. The guy doesn't play the minutes Wade does. He doesn't have to.<br>  Wade can be stopped in the paint. He is not the powerhouse Lebron is, people move aside for Lebron so they don't get put on the disabled list or posterized (see Tim Duncan). You have to look at thngs other than scoring. Have you seen how many blocks Lebron has chased down and made this year? His assists and passing are some of the nastiest in the league. High amount of steals.<br>  I will put it this way, love him or hate him-give any GM in the NBA their choice of player right now, from scratch-Lebron or Wade. You will see a landslide there.<br>  The Cavs will win 60 games this year and are more than likely going to use the home court advanatge they will get to get themselves in the Finals.<br>  It's James. Gunaranteed.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Wade, he has been playing insane this year especially this past month. He has carried a sub-par team to a pretty good record in the East. He is doing it basically all by himself too. I hope he gets the MVP this year.<br>  <br>  Most likely James will get it though because the voters also pick someone with great stats and one of the best records in the NBA. James has that, Wade does not.|`|UYPfC5YVaa	For Dwayne Wade to win the MVP. It will depend on the Heat's standings. If they finish the season on the top 4 in the East, He's got a chance. But if the Heat gets eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, sorry.|`|BFOOOzwBaa	dwade is a killer this year for what reason we all know hes not getting what he deserves which is to be top 2 mvp talk i would say if the season ended right now he would get it|`|H8FHx1HYaa	lebron|`|7e6Vm4cDaa	Wade|`|LNd0tPGkaa	DWADE|`|Xrbmct4daa	I was watching ESPN for a few minutes, listening to some douche talk about how Tim Duncan deserves MVP over Dwyane Wade due to the fact that the Spurz have a better record that the Heat do. So that would mean Tony Parker also deserves MVP award also over Wade... wouldnt it tardface? Having the best winning record should not factor into who is the MVP. It should be factored by who is making his team better with what he has. Wade doesnt have a Mo Williams, or a Pao Gasol. Wade has a highschool varsity team, a team that won a measley 15 wins all of last season. The fact of the matter is...Wade is averaging more assists than Lebron and Kobe. Wade is averaging more points than Lebron and Kobe. Wade is averaging more assists than Lebron and Kobe. Wade is averaging more blocks than Lebron and Kobe. Wade is averaging a better field goal percentage than Lebron and Kobe. Why don't I just compress that all into one sentence??? Because MVP stands for most valuable player, and not most valuable player with the best TEAM record. It is very sad that Wade will not win MVP due to the logic of many mistaken analasysts. As of late these analasysts are turning the MVP award into the Award for Championship Contending Team With an Highly Valuable Player. The key word here is MOST! valuable player, and that what Dwyane Wade is.|`|vxz91VBfaa	Lebrons been deserving it since he became into the league but they dont want to give it to him cause he is so young and has so much more basketball to play in his career. They wanted to give it to kobe before lebron. Lebron is doing the same thing wade is doing but what stands out more is his defence and his record stands out more.Lebron proved that it comes down to the better record. Stats dont equal MVP. Last couple of years lebron has been putting him 30,7and,7 and lead the league in scoring but no MVP .If anything it should be kobe or lebron.|`|TFGI28aTaa	We have to wait until the end of the season. I think tha most valuable player is what D-Wade has been for the HEAT. Ask yourself this question if you take Lebron from Cleveland and you take Wade from Miami what team would be more affected, I believe the Heat. Wade is everything for the Heat. He has carried this team together with 2 rookies and a second-year-man to the 5ht seat in the eastern conference. <br>  <br>  In a separate note. Check the individual performances for both Lebron and Wadde<br>  <br>  Steals - Wade 2.22 PG (2 in NBA) - Lebron 1.69 PG (8 in NBA)<br>  <br>  Assist - Wade 7.7 PG (9 om NBA) - Lebron 7 PG (10 in NBA)<br>  <br>  Blocks - Wade 1.41 PG (21 in NBA) - Lebron 1.18 (29 in NBA)<br>  <br>  Points - Wade 29.7 PG (1 in NBA - Lebron 28.1 PG (2 in NBA)<br>  <br>  FT - Wade (A) 9.4 PG (M) 7.2 - Lebron (A) 9.4 (M) 7.2<br>  <br>  Minutes - Wade 38.5 min PG - Lebron 37.5 min PG<br>  <br>  Wade with this height is getting even more blocks that Lebron. <br>  <br>  In order for Wade to get his MVP the HEAT needs to get into the 4 first seats in the east and get to the eatern conference final.<br>  <br>  Then D-Wade will be the MVP. Please look at the stats before you say something about D Wade.|`|ERXwjAJoaa	D-Wade.<br>  People say Lebron's minutes are down, but he plays only one less minute per game then wade.<br>  D-Wade's stats are better...but that aside, anyone who watches HOW he is getting these gaudy stats will be in awe.  He creates plays for himself nearly every time down the court, as well as for his teammates-often in highlight reel fashion.  Lebron does this too...but just as often it is one of his teammates making the play/stretching the floor for him.<br>  Meanwhile, D-Wade's defense edges lebrons as well-how is he even etting all these blocks at his height?

0b749584c35f2d85b042fb4c77b72f79aa	The competition in Olympics is too much. It's too much of a hardwork, and the probability of getting a gold medal is very low.|`|Z03zgM0maa	because being an olympic gold medalist is almost impossible. a doctor or engineer makes good money and is not nearly as hard to pursue|`|FpGDoRQiaa	Sport is such a hard thing to be the best at. Also the best are the ones which make the money, people under that earn a decent amount (if you're still good) but not nearly close to that of a professional. Which also means, to be the best you generally need to put all your time into it which cuts into your academics and "learning" time. So, if you don't become one of the best in your sports, you better have a backup plan.<br>  <br>  Not only you have to be one of the best, but if you have an accident which may be smallish (injured leg) you may not be able to perform at such a high standard again. It's something you need to have a lot of dedication to and some people like in academics; are just incapable of being the best.<br>  <br>  As mentioned in a previous "answer", a "sports star" is basically just entertainment. They really don't contribute much to the world when you think about it. My personal opinion is that they are paid way too much for an individual which just provides entertainment. But this like everything in the entertainment industry. Personally, I hope to pursue a medical career and I am not being pressured by my parents. I find it a lot more rewarding having a job like a doctor as you know you are truly giving something back and you're getting paid for it. It's basically a win, win.<br>  <br>  In the end, you cannot bring your money with you when you die. A steady and decent source of income is good enough for me. Some people want everything, but as long as I have a roof over my head, some food and the ability to do something I like. I'm cool with it.|`|AA10954785	I think it's because parents prefer their children to earn money, power and/or fame by brain power instead of the 'hands on' method.<br>  <br>  They want their kids to be seen as important individuals that will help the community they live in.|`|50XiZ483aa	MUCH more difficult to become a gold medalist than pursue an actual profession you go to school for.. That is why it is more practical to become a doctor or, a engineer etc.|`|44micVO3aa	It's not easy to become a doctor or an engineer but it is even more difficult to become an Olympic gold medalist. Depending on the events, an Olympic gold does not guarantee stable income to the winner but being a doctor / engineer does.

lYnkvRASaa	Interesting, that the Habs would pick up Metropolit.  I guess this means they think he can bring more than kyle Chipchura.  I expect Chipchura heads to the Bulldogs soon.<br>  <br>  You see more of the Flyers than I do, does he have anything left?<br>  <br>  Canucks pick up a D man does this mean that Ohlund is going to get moved at the deadline I wonder.<br>  <br>  Avery?  If he comes in on reentry waivers are Dallas still responsible for 1/2 of the next three years contract too?  If yes there might be a taker out there although I doubt it is the Rangers what with the high powered offence the will have under Torts.  A goal a game.<br>  <br>  Bob, thats what I expected.  Begin seemed to have found is way into Carbo's doghouse recently.  Seems like a lot of guys have, I'm not sure if there is an issue there, Carbonneau's people skills seem to be very old school - put up or shutup type.  I thought the Begin move was to free a bit of cap space and do him a favor- not sure I understand this pick up unless a he needs more depth at center- ie moving Pleckanac maybe in a deal for a bigger centre<br>  <br>  Edit: Phommahax:  The intent was to waive him to send him to the minors when making the trade.  If he clears he is an insurance policy for later.  The Habs were doing Begin a favor by moving him to a team that he could get icetime with.  Dallas probably insisted they take Janik.  Had Dallas not taken Begin they would have probably waived him.  This way they grant Begin his wish, solve a problem for Dallas, and maybe get some insurance for injury.  Either way Begin was gone at season's end and he has been a healthy scratch recently.|`|51f7d0ee07bcbaea13dc55784aea7f62aa	I'm sorry to see Metro go.  Vaananen, too, but less so.  Metro was a great 4th liner.  Only a 4th liner, granted, but it's helpful to have a good penalty-killer on the fourth line so you don't have to run your stars ragged.  I think the Flyers should have dealt someone, or someones, for at least a draft pick.  It was pretty obvious these two wouldn't clear waivers; it would have been nice to get something for them.  Maybe find an underpaid defenseman and work a big deal with Lupul, Upshall, and/or Asham in addition to the two waived.  Improve the defense at the expense of depth while freeing up the cap space for Briere.<br>  <br>  I agree that trading Briere would have been a good move.  The Flyers are knee-deep in centers right now.  Good though he is, they don't need a third top-line center.|`|1ApbWVhsaa	I'm so glad they dropped Metro..Even though he started to come around and was pretty good on faceoffs.Happy to see Giroux still on the squad.Hoping Briere can play at least 3 games in a row before getting hurt.I think the PP can only get better with Danny hanging out by the side of the net looking for rebounds.<br>  <br>  Avery will end up with Torts.Match made in heaven.<br>  <br>  Bob-Wondering if you saw my question on Giroux the other day?I compared him to Mark Recchi..Good comparsion in your eyes?<br>  <br>  **Bob-I saw a "rumored proposal"-Jay Bo for Lupul and Coburn...I'd rather have a guy who hoisted the cup(Pronger) then a guy who is in the last year of his contract.Hossa anyone?I think that's a crazy deal too.Will Anaheim take Powe and some cheesesteaks for Pronger?Maybe throw in Jenni as well?LOL|`|x5lqWRT3aa	As a Canucks fan, I'm excited that we've picked up Vaannanen. But, yes I do believe this sets up a trade that sends Ohlund away. This rumor is supported by the fact that last night Don Taylor said that contract talks between the Canucks and Ohlund are broken off. So maybe in a couple of days, Ohlund will waive his NTC. <br>  As for Montreal, I think that picking up Metro is a great waiver-wire pick up. He's a very underrated player in my opinion. I think he's going to be an upgrade to the loss of Begin. <br>  <br>  But one thing I don't understand very well is, why did Montreal waive Doug Janik today, after they traded for him? Bob?|`|Jy9KNgSDaa	god i hope someone takes avery! what is it with hicks and paying folks not to play?!?!?!<br>  <br>  CDN24: yes stars are still responsable for 1/2|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Flyers should've kept Metropolit on, and waived Riley Cote.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	metro just got picked up cuz we playing to make a super deal<br>  <br>  <br>  ( thats why begin got traded, to make cap space )

He's the T.O. of basketball.|`|vA7Iq6FSaa	Marbury hasn't done anything with them yet and Rondo isn't that good, he is just benefitting from being on one of the best starting line-ups in basketball.|`|aupDanleaa	garnett<br>  pierce<br>  allen<br>  rondo<br>  <br>  DONT INCLUDE MARBURRY IN THE SAME SENTENCE AS THESE GUYS!!!!!!!!!!|`|NVJ0VOGYaa	its gonna be the big 5 rondo allen pierce kg marbury|`|6Efhd6lNaa	YES!

5XltfLhTaa	Haha c'mon let's be fair here. I am a Real Madrid fan, but I also admire Liverpool.<br>  <br>  You don't expect your player to say the other team is better than the team you are playing at now do you?<br>  <br>  Yeah I agree that the team players have changed a lot throughout the years. But their playing style isn't very far different. I remember that Benitex was brought in to change Houller's defensive plays into attacks, but Benitez himself has shown to be quite defensive.<br>  <br>  Anyway, whatever any other fans say, let's hope for a great game! After all, it is the meeting between two of the most successful clubs in Europe!|`|ebd4b116c0612534749a4cb34b9a7462aa	Yep, cocky Cannavaro.

omszEWSSaa	Nobody ever knows what manny's thinking.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	LOl no, the everyday players hardly play any spring training games anyways. I just think its still in Manny's head that someone will offer him5-6 with over 100 mill. Manny wake up ur not 25 anymore !|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Thats probably part of it.  I mean, he does want the money, but I'm pretty sure that by now he knows he's not going to get the money and years he wants.  Even though the starters don't play much in spring training, he actually would have to show up to the park, work out with the team, ya know, do things that baseball players do to prepare for the season, and Manny wants no part of that.  He's above that in his mind.|`|geih5vR8aa	Yeah, he never like spring training for veteran's like himself. He only needs a couple weeks to get into shape.. plus, the Dodgers are making his contract look retarded, by deferring half his salary for 2-3 years after his contract is up... that's dumb.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	he's just money hungry...manny actually has one of the toughest off season training regimen...people dont realize that..|`|d00cGs5raa	Trust me, Boras knows what he's doing.  He's the best when it comes to screwing teams.|`|3mJ3oqYnaa	he wants money money and he trys to be a wise guy|`|KX4ilkGraa	no the dodgers just dont want to spend so much money and hes a fat a$$
Loq7etfHaa	man I FEEL YOU! ... i check NFL.com every hour Rotoworld.com .. BaltimoreRavens.com (my team) .. and NOTHING CHANGE .. its really boring ... but i have to say i cannot wait for the draft :) are the best 2 days of the offseason|`|13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	i was lucky because my team made it to the superbowl, so i had football until february.  but since then i've been having bouts of depression and complete boredom, especially on sundays.  thankfully my birthday is next week and i'm expecting to get the steelers dvd so i can watch that every sunday until training camp starts.  that should help a little. <br>  <br>  i think it's actually been a pretty interesting offseason so far...all kinds of crazy sh*t going on.  at least that's something to keep us entertained....somewhat.|`|5gKGtSriaa	I know what you mean. Hiowever, during the weeks I wait and check NFL.com 2 a day or more. I wish it would start back up. Luckily, I have neighbors and on the weekends 12 kids play football with me and my borther. It's tons of fun. Last weekend my team crushed the other, and I had like 5 picks all for TD, one was in the Endzone. We even play on a real field. It's fun.<br>  <br>  But till real football starts, we'll just sit here a wait...|`|jTKxLFuWaa	Shoot man, werd up. I'm watching countless football highlights from over the past season from nfl.com to spice up some football in my life. It feels as if I've never appreciated the entire season while it was still happening. I just want Kickoff to begin, damn it -.-|`|1vyHWeXRaa	yes i agree i taped all the games from the previous season so i can watch them the offf season. that way i wont have withdrawals isnt that funny. i hate the off season|`|cSrWQokbaa	Yes only because Basket Ball and Baseball are overrated,Hockey is for Canadians, and the only sports that counts are College and Pro Football|`|sAHTMuAeaa	ABSOLUTELY.<br>  <br>  I miss everything about the season.<br>  <br>  Go Raiders!|`|3lFDvyY9aa	I think it's good to like football but you can't let it be you're god|`|sBrYcT5daa	yeah, endless commercial breaks, booth reviews, countless timeouts. Can't wait to have that back.|`|BBEBPxOaaa	Yes.Be patient. I know that feeling. Enjoy your spring and summer in the meantime.|`|AA12103453	I'll be ok on Sunday,with the local Independent Indoor Football League and the the local team starts Sunday. I mean I admit the off season seems too long. I don't want it to be so long, but I also can understand why it's so long. I mean it makes you want the season more. The worst part though is that it's so far spread apart. I mean Free Agency is basically over with-in 2 weeks(if that) and then you wait about 2 months for the draft.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Yes, and I'll probably lose my TC badge since things are so slow. But not that I was really that useful here anyway lol. Have to have a sense of humor here.|`|6tGYe5roaa	Yea the off season does suck and my Sundays are always a little boring. But luckily the off season comes at a good time. It is during the best seasons, Spring and Summer, where there is always a lot to do.<br>  <br>  Also, you gotta find other sports to occupy yourself. It's march: March Madness starts soon. That excites me! And then of course, there is baseball.|`|UxooffHZaa	Part of the reason football is so popular is because it makes us wait. Antici- - - - -pation. But yeah, I need my football fix. So, I study the draft! How lame of me.|`|wxXguyK3aa	Yeah, I actually have to watch baseball!|`|s9Pwnb87aa	I know what you mean.....|`|HtYGxZcCaa	I can bear through it because Basketball is starting to heat up, March Madness is here in College Basketball and shortly arriving is the NBA Playoffs. The Summer gets boring though I find baseball boring to watch at times, Im only a casual fan and I can only watch a full game if Im actually at the game so I spend my summers outside and doing activities rather than watching sports|`|AA11110524	yeah man i cant wait for the regular season to start. i also cant wait for the draft i hope the raiders can get Crabtree. untill then man College round-ball is where its at, march madness. i cant tell you watch base ball cause i dont. not untill october, then i become a baseball expert.|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Yeah the drafting and trading side of the offseason is cool and exciting, but a lot of it is waiting.  I don't check NFL.com that frequently, but I hate just sitting here thinking football and knowing I have another 4-5 months to go.  Baseball is starting though so I should be set...|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	I cant wait either. But theres nothing you can do so focus your mind elsewhere.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	That's why being an official is great.  I'm starting in a study group tonight to start going over stuff for next season.  My off-season is over.|`|11nqBcOcaa	football is my favorite sport,i keep up, but the season i long for|`|JTSNljLhaa	thats just one more thing i hate about spring and summer...guess its hibernation time for me till fall|`|xRsiYmxPaa	how many week till the draft  t i hate free agency
DqgnVPRWaa	The dodgers will be just fine, count on it~|`|eL4XZUovaa	I don't think the Dodgers will dump Manny since the suspension is wrong seeing his so called 'steroids' were prescribed. And IIRC they weren't called steroids but a banned substance. If I were Manny I'd show my doctor's script and not only insist they overturn the suspension but apologize for the undue embarrassment. <br>  <br>  But that's just me, all IMHO so YMMV . :-)<br>  <br>  Seriously, what would you expect from an organization that insists on wood bats only.|`|frrFZTxhaa	They will NOT make a trade.<br>  <br>  Juan Pierre will be inserted into his place in left field. Before Manny has traded to the Dodgers last year - Pierre had the longest active consecutive games played streak in MLB (5+ years). He is a career .300 hitter with great speed. The only people that will be effected are Hudson and Either who bat in front and behind Manny - you will see there averages go down - but the Dodgers will survive the next 50 games and still win the NL West. <br>  <br>  I personally think they will still be in first place in the West when Manny returns. And come playoff time - Manny will not be worn down from the long season - which could be a blessing in diguise.|`|ZihoDc9eaa	Many of the young talent now have a chance to prove themselves and the league that they can do well without manny...Andre Ethier, Matt Kemp, James Lonely...its not like their win straek has all been inspite of manny alone|`|9cf990b2f4cdf4139f00d578d1e936c9aa	Yes! The Dodger organization are currently talking to Mark McGwire for a possible trade for Manny Ramirez. Dodger wants 40 bottles of Androstenedione (steroid) while McGwire wants to play shortstop.... Updates will be posted later...|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Sign Bonds. Only $400k, pro-rated, so maybe $310k. A bargain.<br>  <br>  Pick up Pedro while they're at it. He wants $5M, Manny's rebating about $7M, so they're still in pocket.|`|4cJuKxJbaa	It is to early in the season to start talking trades. Teams dont know who is going to be buyers & who is going to be sellers yet. Belive me if there were trade markets yet the Yankees would be making some moves for a reliver or two!
PGlZn1wEaa	Most the cars are wrapped head to toe.    Only a few teams aside from lesser funded teams paint.  Not only are decals faster then painting but decals are lighter then paint which was the main reason they switched to decals years ago.   They are sectional decals. I've seen it done.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Here Storm.  Looks like they are doing Biffles car in the video.  Again..Head to toe. Paint is old news. <br>  <a href="http://www.motorsportsdesigns.com/racewraps.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.motorsportsdesigns.com/racewr...</a><br>  <br>  Cars that are wrapped are quite obvious.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Jeff has had some that were actually painted and I think Jr had a camoflage one that was also but it is usually just decals.  Some teams will go as far as clear coating over the top of them to reduce the drag on the edge of the decals and the totally painted ones are supposed to have even less wind resistance.  <br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|BD78ZzYkaa	Some get wrapped, some actually get painted.|`|4l0yGuE9aa	I think the main part is paint.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	Both i heard .|`|JSryPP8faa	They actually call it a wrap, a giant decal. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB0cbZjv24o" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB0cbZjv2...</a>|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	I guess they do paint the cars.  I thought it was that shrink wrap like you see on some buses in the city.

But, I thought they applied a "giant" wrap and then applied decals to that.<br>  <br>  *SHOQ*|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Hasn't been paint for about 5 years now. Most of the teams now exclusively use the "body decals"....only the smaller one small teams still paint due to lack of fundage. Really helps out with backup cars when they are using special schemes from week to week. I have got to watch it being done by some of my Penske buddies...it's pretty cool how they do it. WISH I get one for my personal car....Just think I could have a #43 Chevy Cobalt! That'd be a bit silly but would make my commute to work much more fun!<br>  <br>  Just an opinion as always.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	A little of each, really.. The smaller stuff, including headlights, and taillights are decals... So are most of the numbers, and logos..<br>  The colors on the major body parts is paint..<br>  Thank Roger Penske for that.. At one time the cars got by on one paint job per season... Some didn't even wash the car between races (it's only gonna' get dirty again).. Roger started showing up with showroom fresh looking cars.. And he got the good sponsors..|`|jLvlcoFBaa	A simple answer.<br>  <br>  Base colors are paint, rest is decals.

NnsizqH2aa	Oooo!<br>  <br>  I like these kinds of questions, but most people don't like my answers. I focus on what is most practical, not what is expected. As a cop and former military man, I go hard-core for that "martial" side of the arts and don't tend to go near the more historic side.<br>  <br>  The question is, what "should" you train in? Forget everything else.<br>  <br>  Although you specify non-blade weapons, knives would be at the top of my list. They can be easily applied, using largely the same motions that you have already learned in your art. They focus on speed, surprise and hidden motion, and thorough instruction will include the best carry sites and drawing motions for modern tactical folders (as well as how to best open them without moving your hand off to the side, away from the space between you and the opponent). More important, because 8 out of every 10 Americans carry them, they should be part of every MA person's regular training, both to defend against and to be able to use. They can also be used as a striking implement when closed, or from the pommel side.<br>  <br>  Next, I would add palm-sticks. Again, they are easy to carry and conceal, and are legal in every state. They can be used from an abbreviated version of just about any block or strike, and thereby can be practiced in virtually any empty-hand form. <br>  <br>  I also like a good "swagger stick", known for hitting horses as you ride them hard. Smack a man in the streets with such a few times and he'll be too embarrassed to come at you ever again. Short enough to carry under your jacket, but impressive in the sheer pain and bruises that it dishes out.<br>  <br>  Next, for the modern "martial" artist, would be the gun. You can acquire some cheap but realistic air pistols/ rifles at any Wal-Mart or sporting goods store. There's no better way to prepare for armed assailants than to routinely train with the weapons they will carry. The ancient arts recognized the importance of the firearm through the practice of teppo-jutsu, which is easily found referred to in Miyamoto Musashi's "Book of Five Rings." Why would we be less concerned with such tactics today than they were in the 17th and 18th centuries?<br>  <br>  Belts are nice. I encourage all men and women to wear them, and despise this jail-life homo-based trend of wearing pants down low. You can't run like that and can't play ball like that, so what practical purpose does it have other than to make life easier for the big bruisers that bend you over in jail? If you want to send that kind of message out, by all means continue to wear your pants low. The rest of us should be wearing belts and training in how to apply them in beating, trapping, wrapping and choking others.<br>  <br>  The cane would also be in my list. You don't have to be handicapped to carry one, and no one will likely stop you from doing so. Smarter MA trainers are getting certified to teach this important tool, and it has become a favorite in the circles of police & military practitioners of Defendo. Add it to your list of tools to be developed and kept for the rest of your life, since it may well be one of the most practical weapons you could learn for advancing years. Old age does come to all of us lucky enough to reach it.<br>  <br>  Machete is a nice cheap substitute for sword training. It makes use of many of the same motions, but requires you to get much closer than most fighters are used to. They can be bought at any Wal-Mart or garden store. A simple American sickle is another option. (For that matter, most tools in your tool-box are better than your traditional MA weapons).<br>  <br>  **************<br>  I'm not a fan of things like nunchaku and such anymore. I spent years learning such, only to discover that they were simply not practical to most situations I would find myself in. Unless you have special license, most martial arts weapons are illegal in many states. So, although I grew up making my own nunchaku and 3-sectional staves and such, I would not carry them today. That's just an easy arrest waiting to happen, something I would know all too well as a former cop that made such arrests myself in the past. It's also a waste of much precious time that you would otherwise be spending on more realistic fighting skills. (So, although Shihan J there likely has much experience & knowledge in his art, I'd stay away from everything in his list. No disrespect.)<br>  <br>  Don't let yourself get caught up in what's hot or what's flashy. Focus on what is most practical to your life in today's times. That's what MA men of old did, and what we should continue to do today.<br>  <br>  .|`|oTb67zNYaa	yes the cane but I would like to add not to get a hooked one that hook makes it easier for an attacker to take it away from you and it is easy to get it caught on your clothes also while police will in most cases not stop you for possession of a cane if you look like you do not need one it can cause unwanted attention better for when you are out of the city|`|YDpT2ClBaa	uncommon or rare weapons<br>  eku<br>  dajio<br>  bisento<br>  sansetsu kon<br>  yonsetsu kon<br>  jiffa<br>  tekko<br>  tentsu<br>  tessen<br>  teko<br>  tenchu<br>  tinpe & rorin<br>  tinpe & seryuto<br>  rokushaku-kama<br>  kama<br>  kusarigama<br>  kuwa<br>  gekiguan<br>  <br>  although without an instructor the only thing you will be doing is twirling them around. to properly learn weapons you need a qualified instructor.|`|AA10698309	Nunchaku <br>  1) Verstile - kind of...<br>  2) Non-blade - yes<br>  3) Fast - very<br>  4) Cheap - yes<br>  5) Something not normally known of - most people don't carry these.|`|ZegKais3aa	whoa.....slow down there crouching tiger, master a martial art  first so that you know what to do and don't hurt yourself|`|Km9QC8a9aa	Cane / walking stick<br>  <br>  Versatile <br>  Non-blade<br>  As fast as you are<br>  As expensive or inexpensive as you choose<br>  One does not usually associate a walking stick with martial arts.<br>  <br>  Not only that...<br>  The cane/walking stick is a legal street weapon that can be carried openly.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  The hook (or handle) is what makes the weapon! (IMO)<br>  <br>  It allows you to snag, hook, twist, gouge, deliver a blow to the back of the neck from the front, break a joint with a twist or a flick and any number of other applications. <br>  <br>  Personally, I prefer an "L" cane to hook cane. An "L" handle allows you to use the end of the handle as a striking surface (like a hammer) and deliver a maximal amount of force over a minimal area. This works very well for precision strikes to the knee, nose, collar bone, ankle or some other soft spot.<br>  <br>  If you are willing to pay the price, you can get some VERY nasty canes from Cane Masters. I prefer a regular cane myself. If you carry something that LOOKS like a weapon, you have lost the element of surprise!<br>  .|`|LUnscegvaa	Kubotan<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubotan" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubotan</a><br>  <br>  I'd suggest<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***

aXdGCbEDaa	We really can't be sure yet.I've got a feeling that HBK will retire at WM25,his back injuries are too much for him.However,I'm sure that he'll be a big part of WWE after he retires.As for The Undertaker,I think that he still has a few more years left in him.He's only 43,so I don't think that he's retiring this year.However,the original WM25 plans say otherwise.It would kill me to see them retire though,but they deserve it.They've both given us so much over the years,it's amazing.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	Probably not.

Players such as ben mckinley, mark lecras, eric mckenzie, chris masten (my tip for rising star), mitch brown, nick natanui, beau wilkes, will schofield, scott selwood, brad ebert, jamie mcnamara, josh kennedy, Tim houlihan, ryan davis etc.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this season I will do better in tipping, I tipped with my heart last year which did not do me too well. And im looking forward to seeing how I do in my first ever supercoach year, ive never played before and it should help me to be better for the future. Should be a fun opportunity. <br>  <br>  I dont think the eagles will make the eight, im excited to see them making just 10th or 11th. Anything not in the bottom five is good enough for me, its an improvemenet and it can only mean well for our clubs future. <br>  <br>  Cant wait to see our gun senior players.<br>  Dean Cox, Daniel Kerr are the two main ones. Along with Darren Glass, Ashley Hansen, Quinten Lynch, matthew Priddis, Andrew Embley, shannon hurn, brett jones, adam hunter, david wirrapanda, brent staker etc.<br>  <br>  Cant wait to see the new blokes - Nick Natanui, Tom Swift, Jordan Jones, Luke Shuey etc. Especially Adam Cockie, what a fantastic player (coz hes from subiaco!!) and he did so well in the nab cup.<br>  <br>  Very excited for season 2009.|`|4wRyTY9Raa	You forgot fox sports fantasy team too mate, lol.   all these games and leagues we are in should be fun, the tips don't excite me too much, but the fact that the 'real' footy is just around the corner does, i can't wait to see if we're going to be any good, carlton are a good test as i think they'll play finals this year, not sold on us yet, i'm hoping but who knows, we just have to make the 8.<br>  <br>  we have one spot to fill in fox sports game, it'll be good to see the draw, we play each other twice, gunna be a laugh.<br>  <br>  go the Stompers.|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	I am happy for the season to start and put last year behind us and know we all start off on an even keel.<br>  Also excited about footy tips but I am crap at them this could be my year though.<br>  Bring on the season proper.|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	Nab cup sucks it isn't even a true reflection on teams.

kqP7GwOcaa	The Parachutist at the Bowe/Holyfield fight is certainly up there.<br>  <br>  The Riot at Madison Square Garden after the Bowe/Golata fight came after the DQ, so it really doesn't count. <br>  <br>  There have been a couple black outs, electrical problems that put arena's in the dark a couple times.<br>  <br>  I think the strangest thing that ever interrupted a boxing match was what ever caused Oliver McCall, Andrew Golata and Henry Akenwande to try and fight Lennox Lewis without actually throwing any punches.  Quite an interesting run where opponents wouldn't punch.|`|AA12325046	Roco nailed this one and I give him a thumbs up!

4tvI9WYjaa	* HBK’s music. He comes out in jeans, an un-tucked off-white/beige button down shirt an cowboy hat. He says Taker is 16-0 at WM. But HBK is no slouch himself. This past week on SD! he put together an HBK video package to remind Taker of who he is. Taker might be 16-0 but HBK is Mr. WM. Streaks come to an end and nothing lasts forever. At WM something’s got to give. So the best he can tell... GONG! A Taker video package from his WM Matches of past. Clips from each year and each opponent. The video ends, the fans go wild and Taker is behind HBK in the ring. HBK, still leaning on the ropes said hello to Taker. HBK said he’s been expecting him. Taker’s arrogance has clouded his judgement. He does respect Taker, but HBK’s fought many men and they have fallen. Taker will be no different. They’ve taken very different career and personal paths. HBK sais he shouldn’t have to qualify to face anyone at WM. He created the Ladder Match, set the bar and retired Flair. He’s the Show Stopper and is ready for this. Taker says HBK’s had epic wins at WM, and huge defeats. But his dream of beating Taker at WM is a dream. It will so be laid to rest. HBK concerns himself with being the Show Stopper. HBK concerns himself with breaking the streak. He should be worried about what Taker will do to him. Taker doesn’t have to steal the show. But when Taker enters, everyone knows he’s the most dangerous entity in the ring. HBK should be careful what he asks for, because he’s got it. At WM25 Taker stumbles here - for the second time in his speech) HBK will... HBK cut him off and said he’ll rest comfortably after it over for beating Taker. HBK says Taker’s never beaten him, and never will. HBK leaves the ring with Taker standing there glaring.<br>   <br>  * cm punk vs jbl for the ic tittle  jbl won  with a rake to cm punks eyes and finish off with a clothes line from hell winner and new ic champion jbl.<br>  <br>  *jbl is talking to vickie about his victory <br>  <br>  * king and cole talk about triple h attack last week on randy orton<br>  <br>  * maryse vs melina non tittle match raw vs smackdown with all divas from the two brands maryse pick up the pinfall <br>  <br>  *video showeing vickie setting up the contract signing from smack own with edge and the big show for the world tittle match at wrestle mania john cena has been added to the match at wrestle mania<br>  <br>  * vickie comes out and annouced a 25 diva battle royal at wrestlemania 25 to future all the current divas and some from the past.<br>  <br>  * a money in the bank match chris jericho vs kofi kingston <br>  kofi kingston  wins with distraction from ric flair <br>  <br>  * chris jericho challenged ric flair next week<br>  <br>  *christan finlay rey mysterio vs kane and the miz and john morrison  is up next with rey mysterio finlay and christan  got the win with rey hitting 619 on morrison for the win<br>  <br>  *main event ted debiase and cody rhodes vs triple h in a handi cap match end in no contest  with randy orton interfering <br>  <br>  couple match annouced  for next week undertaker to team up with hbk to take on jbl and vladimir kozlov <br>  ric flair to face chris jericho|`|SXRdNW80aa	<a href="http://www.wrestlezone.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.wrestlezone.com.</a> They always post full details.

ZVSZZ6qHaa	You would think they would have spent their money a little better.|`|fKAnnQeWaa	When the Cubs agreed with Milton Bradley on signing for 3 yr/30 MM everyone knew what was expected. Currently the Cubs do not need a guy who can hit 40 HR and drive in 140 in 162 games. They just need a powerful lefty bat. <br>  <br>  The expected stats from Bradley will be 125-140 GP and 20+ HR with a respectable amount of RBI. <br>  <br>  The reason why the Cubs are carrying so many outfielders is to rest Bradley and Soriano every now and then.<br>  <br>  Joey Gathright, Aaron Miles, Kosuke Fukudome, So Taguchi, Micah Hoffpauir and Reed Johnson can all play the Outfield spots so not much pressure will be put on the injury prone outfielders.<br>  <br>  Soto, Ramirez and Lee can take care of the power swings. The way I look at it the Cubs are looking at about 20-30 different lineups throughout the season and I know Lou Piniella will love all the versatility.|`|3buQDaRDaa	Yeah. I would have preferred the Cubs signed Adam Dunn. They could have moved Soriano back to 2nd base and placed Dunn in LF.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	That is what they exactly should do.|`|GW2HHBw9aa	The Cubs signing of Milton Bradley did turn out to be a bad one in hindsight when we see what happened with the market to corner OFers. Bradley has a history of injury and it was a questionable signing even when they made it, but they do have clauses in the contract to allow them to void the last two years if injuries limit Bradley's playing time. So they should light fire to $10M but no need for $30M.|`|Rs9nJclIaa	Cubs are just on a free spend right now trying to do something again to make the play offs but with signing Bradley and Abreu they are trying to get power but wont happen. Cuba last year was your only real shoot. Card was hurt Brew fell off at the end. Cards have Capenter back Wainwright is back healthy and the cards with a mix and match rotation will kepp up and give the cubbie a run for there money|`|7WEMbBjsaa	The Cubs might not ever have the experienced scouts to aquire the right player for money, but sooner or later, their money will be well spent.<br>  <br>  Do we all remember the "Shaun Dunston Effect?" We paid him very well to sit on a bench for 2 years, way to go management!<br>  <br>  What they need is a claus that says "If a player does not perform to their abilities, they will not receive the maximum payment for their salary."<br>  <br>  Maybe that would convince a player to play their heart out?|`|ZatADRPXaa	That's exactly what they should do.  I mean, the Cubs would only pull a player feeling a little tightness in a spring training game if they were ready to give up on him.  Really, what's the worst that could happen in a completely meaningless game?|`|Ff2qf5t3aa	They should just get rid of the entire team. They ain't goin no where anyways, just burn down the field with da player in it.<br>  <br>  <br>  That way my CHICAGO WHITE SOX  can be the only team in Chicago|`|c6q3EERdaa	I knew that Bradley was going to be trouble, mainly for his attitude. The Cubs should've stuck with Edmonds.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	mild tightness in his left quadriceps..... it's the 1st week of spring training. a lot of guys have things like this going on.<br>  <br>  as for the attitude everyone is talking about.... find an ex-team mate that has a problem with him.

1uSoU8Lpaa	I just think that he's embarrassed that he didn't get as much as he wanted, he's being obstinate. He's like a kid who refuses to get any bike because he's not getting the one he wants. So, he'll pout until he gets his way or remain without anything at all.|`|c6q3EERdaa	I think it's because he wants more money than that. He should realize at some point that he won't get any offers from other teams, and that both sides (Manny and the Dodgers) need each other.|`|omszEWSSaa	For two reasons...<br>  <br>  1. He doesn't want to go to spring training<br>  <br>  2. He's playing hard to get so that he seems like a great player|`|d9755b1afe952617603d01f2e4c6acb1aa	ok u know what i think i mean plz dont rate up or down plz but my real reason is that i think he wants to go to the Giants u know what made me think that. well Scott Boras said " Manny told me that he feels that <br>  San Francisco team could go somewhere" and it will as soon as Manny signs with the Giants|`|xIfvXy4waa	:) Because he wants more years so he can "quit" on the team again. Hey nice to see you agian!|`|c3tADklmaa	To temper the other teams when their star OF is injured or they suck and have the money.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	He thinks he can still get the big money and hes wrong|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I think so as well.  I mean, the money may be a part of it, but I think he knows and Scott Boras knows, that he has no other option.  No other team will give him what he wants and he probably figures that if he's going to have to settle for the same offer he was offered awhile ago, he may as well drag it out and not have to play spring training.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Several reasons, spring trainingmight be one. There's also contract length. He wants 3, 4 years. That might be more important to him than the actual dollar amount. Finally, if enough time passes, another team can sign Manny and not give up 2 draft picks to the Dodgers. At that point, the bidding will llikely become more serious.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	he Just wants his way and he wants to have say in it..he wants big money and he wants lots of options and power over his future..i dont think it has anyting to do with spring training...dont take it so serious,he's just being a hard-headed businessman rightnow|`|39fxsuGaaa	I think you're absolutely correct.<br>  LA's going to need him no matter what so he can afford to wait out February and most of March before signing. And, in the meantime, maybe another team loses an outfielder to injury and all of a sudden there's a bidding war...|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Same trick many veteran football players use to avoid training camp.|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	Or he just doesnt want to play for the dodgers and hopes another team throws more money to him which i doubt will happen|`|AYiVipawaa	He's worth more than what he's getting offered.<br>  <br>  Teix got 22 mill.<br>  Arod got 27 mill.|`|QcBGLc7Caa	what Manny is doing is waiting for the Yankees to offer him a contract and i would not be surprised if that ends up happening. watch their going to offer him 2 years/55 million and then your going to see him rock Boston and rock the Yankees to top and win the world series just watch I've been right through out all of the off season.|`|O1PpybX0aa	I just think that he's embarrassed that he didn't get as much as he wanted, he's being obstinate.

8zgFyfibaa	No, neither will all the veterans that we want like (bofo, cuahtemoc blanco, borgetti, ramon morales). <br>  <br>  Idk why eriksson hasn't called the veterans, they have the experience and that's what mexico needs right now, eriksson puts in a naturalizado instead of one of those we know damm well, if bofo or cuahtemoc were in EL TRI they wil do a better job than vuoso and leandro.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: @ chivasteka lol thanks man!!!! Like I said wen its about america and chivas its a rivalry but when its about EL TRI, I put my rivalry aside with any club in mexico because we are all rooting for the same team which is mexico.|`|SvNcWfdJaa	nah i dont think so but i sure hope he does!|`|797a439de0e6ccfb323175f8098a598aaa	right now Bofo is not playing on his team, i mean, he's there but the coach has him on the bench, for him to play in the national team (if that's what ur refering to), needs to be a starter on his team, he's a good player but the times he has been called for the national team, he has not delivered a good presentation.|`|M9Hh6MPpaa	What?! They didn't call Bofo to play against Bolivia. <br>   I've had it with this motherf*$#N coach preparing Mexico for World Cup 2040.

aRy2ZvT9aa	I will admit I'm not Rowdy Busch's biggest fan. But yeah I'd miss him. But one thing for sure I'd cheer for him in F1 and I have a lot of friends in Europe that I can go visit and see him race (and I would) Rowdy will do America proud, get the US back in Victory Lane, he might have a yr learning curve, but If there is an America Race Car driver that can do it and do the US of A proud, he will, he needs to get there while he is young, face it he can drive Sprint Cup till he is 50. F1 you are over the hill at 30. He can go to F1 drive 2-3 or more yrs and comes back and still win more Sprint Cup races and championships. But if I was his girlfriend I'd be worried, all those super models/show biz gals grap up the F1 guys. Lewis Hamiltons fiance is the lead singer in the Pussycat Dolls... Seriously Kyle Busch is America's best hope for any type of real real; stats in F1, theres nothing else out there that can do it. Wow just seeing Kyle Busch's name on the same list as Michael Schumacher, Oh WOW. Winter Glory can you handle this?? Yeah I know you can..<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Yes I would miss him.  I have only watched NASCAR and have no interests really in F1.  If Kyle would go I would have to watch it just to see...and maybe I would like it.  But if not I would wish him luck and hope that he would come back to NASCAR.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	I think it'd be great to see an American go over there and kick some tail. If anyone can drive one of those "golf carts on steroids" it'd be Kyle Busch. I think F1 would benefit...NASCAR would lose. Personally...I could care less either way. Not a hater...not a fan of shrub.<br>  <br>  Just an opinion as always.|`|Qz80EA45aa	I wouldn't miss him. But I might be able to bring myself to cheer for him in FIA.|`|VMDljEFuaa	If?  I'd pay to see him go now.<br>  <br>  It'd be really interesting to see how long the F-1 boys put up with his whining and his "agressive" driving.  Besides, it would get him out of Cup racing for a year or two.  I could use a break for a while.  <br>  <br>  Haul Azz KY, don't get run over.<br>  <br>  And finally, No, I would not miss it.<br>  <br>  Rrrmmm Rrrmmm|`|W2R8TRDmaa	He won't ruin his career if he is good enough.  Even if USF1 is a stinker, he will land a great ride eventually if he is quick. Almost every top driver started in a low end team.  I'm no Kyle fan but I hope he does end up there.  F1 is the pinnacle of motorsport and it would be cool to see an American succeed there.  There hasn't been an American World Champion since the 70's.|`|cKl8ZSrSaa	Yeah I'd miss him, but that would be a good way for me to start watching F-1...if he's in it.|`|muc8sq9naa	Personally, I would not miss him.  But I think he would be crazy to move to F1 before he wins  a Cup Championship, because I think he is capable of winning the Championship.<br>  <br>  *SHOQ*|`|Uaj4B84iaa	I would definitely miss him. His driving style and personality really help make the sport interesting. I'm sure Kyle would do well in whatever he drives, but I hope he stays with Nascar for a long while!|`|bXGwTQy6aa	i think he would suck in F...he's too wild and he likes to wrestle his car all over the track and even  get a little bump and grind....f1 cars would torn to pieces with his driving style|`|LpR9sLSlaa	Like D-MAN said<br>  <br>  his style wouldn't very well in F-1<br>  he needs fenders and bumpers|`|4l0yGuE9aa	Seriously Kyle adds to the sport. He may not be my favorite driver but he adds excitement. As long as NASCAR in general shows the same treatment toward all drivers and keeps things fair and enforces the rules the same way for all drivers then I have no problem with Kyle. Kyle is a competitive driver and competition is what makes this sport exciting. I would rather see the ones that can't drive go to F1 instead of out there on NASCAR tracks wrecking the competitive drivers each week.|`|0MuRCU5paa	I would miss him because then who would I love to hate in Nascar? Seriously though, the Shrub has some skills and he would be quite dumb to move to F1 now or at any point in his career. He could be an alltime great in Nascar if he has a 20+ year career.|`|mTGEeCHaaa	Although I don't like him much, I would miss him in NASCAR.  He provides a lot of excitement and entertainment.  But if that's what he chooses to do, I wish him good luck.  He might find out that the grass isn't greener in F1.|`|c3tADklmaa	I'm not sure if Kyle is skilled at road courses. He's dominated the Nascar world last year before the Chase, and he's still to young to switch careers.
XTHmWkhWaa	To be honest with you, i see Kobe to get either two teams. Lakerrs or Orlando( i know people think im crazy, but let me explain). Orlando is in Florida, which means thats the  only state with tax free income. and Orlando also have a big market. This year orlando has money sicne hedo turkolgu is opting out. and I know Kobe doesnt want to admit that "he can't do it without Shaq", so he could go to Orlando because of Dwight Howard. He is a younger and better Shaq.

So what's the storyline, like a Michaels - Jericho type feud, 'this has been eating Jericho since he was a kid' or Michaels - Batista type feud, 'you lied to me, now I'm going to hurt you.'

CBVlu3Gvaa	OJ,<br>  The preceding answer mentioned about 3 things that could be going wrong in your swing causing you to slice the ball.  There are about 4 or 5 other things that could be going on as well.  My advice would be a quick lesson with a teaching Pro  so that you can identify the flaw or flaws and correct them......You can't correct what you don't know about.  As golfers we tend to think we are doing a certain thing with our swing....when in fact we are doing something totally different.  Thus the outside eyes of the Pro will see what is going on and can offer the corrections necessary.|`|JH9IMMDtaa	you have what is called a slice... it means you have a inside out swing, when you need to have an outside in swing... check out this video, and you will understand what I'm talking about. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXjDft0IiEo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXjDft0Ii...</a>|`|sSgTuD5Vaa	Hello. Well, being that you are new to the sport, don't expect to be a pro in just a month or so. To be honest, where as power is a nice thing to have in golf, it is not all that necessary. Trying to kill the ball is only going to lead to frustration and bad shots. Take it easy. <br>  <br>  As for the issue with it going right, I may have a solution. When the club comes down to impact with the ball how is the club face positioned? Is it open? Keep the club head square and, in addition to that, check the position of your hands at impact with the ball as well. If you can see the inside of your palm, then your club face is most definitely open which then in turns leads to the ball veering right. <br>  <br>  On the other hand your body could be moving faster than your hands. What I mean by this is that when you are swinging through, your hips are turning quicker than your hands are coming through the shot. If this happens then your hands are behind the shot and as you come through the club head has not fully turned so that its square with the ball at impact. Try and keep everything in sync. If that means slowing down your overall swing speed and rotation so that it stays in tune with your hands then so be it.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope this helps.|`|nkPMesJdaa	All the above answers were good answers but your troubles I gather are with the driver (200-250 yds). Your shot starts straight and then slices (dramatic curve). You are, in my opinion, hitting down on the ball with a slightly open club face. Because your driver is the longest club in your bag, you will sometimes be late getting the club face squared up at impact. The driver must impact the ball slightly on the upswing. This means that at a point just before the ball, your club head must reach the bottom of its swing arc and catch the ball as it begins to swing up. Check ball placement is in line with the front heel and you keep your hands pretty much in line with your belt buckle at address. This sets you up behind the ball at the start. Learning to square up the club face will take a little time and maybe another lesson. :)   Good luck|`|GNNh52OMaa	it's expected to not be good when you are a beginner.|`|5xQKA3LAaa	What you are describing is commonly referred to as a slice. You have a lot of company - this is by far the most common miss amongst amateur golfers.<br>  <br>  There could be (and probably is) a number of flaws in your swing. The dramatic curving to the right that you are referring to is caused by the club face being open at impact.<br>  <br>  1. Check your ball position. With a driver the ball should be in line with your left instep. The further back you play the ball the less time you have to square the face.<br>  2. Check your grip. If your right hand is too much on top of the grip  or covering your left hand too much (known as a "weak" grip) you could be restricting the clubs natural tendency to turn over. By moving your right hand slightly to the right or more underneath the grip (known as a "strong" grip) the club will release more easily. Caution: Use a slightly stronger grip. Too much underneath and you'll start flipping and hitting it low-left.<br>  3. Approach the ball from the inside. Imagine that your are swinging out to the right. Inside approach + square club face = slight draw. Too many amateurs swing the club like a baseball bat. Over the top and with an open face. Once the ball starts going right many people try to swing more left which puts more side spin on the ball and makes the problem worse.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps. Most importantly you should find a good teacher near you. Most courses and nicer ranges have PGA teaching pros. I know those new clubs look great, but you are so much better off spending your money on lessons.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stick with it.
BW751lSXaa	well i think vela gets into the right positions but just cant seem to get the ball in the net. when arsenal played sunderland last week at the emirates he wasted a very good chance from just a few yards out so i think if he carries on getting into these positions the goal will come , however i dont think wenger actaully gives him enough time on the pitch|`|7Xridrxaaa	Gio? wtf he isnt even getting any playtime outside cup competition.

COME ON ARSENAL!|`|DO7nz8aRaa	it will probably be vela because he's more of a goal scorer than gio|`|pSOmwwlIaa	I think it'll be Gio. He's starting to regain his level that he lost from SUB 17 World Cup. Gio is good but the last months he has been doing bad, getting scared to get tackle and just taking care of his legs. Now he's lost his fear and now going in for it. I'm glad he's changed attitude and he's been improving. I say 2-3 months from now he may be a starter for Tottenham and possibly for El Trio too.|`|eWadjRfpaa	Gio.<br>  After the game with shakhtar the coach might see his real potential and start playing him more minutes.<br>  All gio has to do is aprovechar those minutes the coach gives him and one day be started making alot of gols!|`|Cpm25Pekaa	Gio has more of a chance even though I think they said Vela is replacing Adebayor for like a game.|`|ZWyKCsqBaa	I go with Gio, his REAL CAREER HAS JUST STARTED.|`|Kq46gkHUaa	vela has more minutes playing so i think vela
YwM8Z14oaa	If you are a 1 handicap ten I would go with Muscle back. I have a a set. And I am about the same skill level. Go with Mizunos, Mp 67, You will love these clubs, When you hit the sweet spot is is the greatest feeling in the world.<br>  <br>  They are expensive so if you can't afford them then Try for SOme Nike's or cheaper Mizunos, Definitely go with a cavity back if your not going with the Mizuno Muscle back though. Better forgiveness.<br>  <br>  I nike and Mizuno best for Irons, But I know Titlist make some good ones, and Callaway have some ok ones, they just seem weird for irons, sometimes you can find like an off brand, but still has good Irons. Try a GOlf outlet store. Check Ebay too.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|aX8nee8gaa	Well blades and muscle backs are 2 ways to describe the same club. The Cobra Forged CB does have a little bit of cavity for forgiveness (hence the CB in the name) so should be OK for you. If you are a slicer I would steer toward something with more offset. If you hit the ball straight to slightly right to left this should be ideal. You may find that you lose a little distance because the lofts may be a little weaker than you are accustomed to. When you buy them have the store bend them to your current lofts, they should do that for free if you are buying an iron set.|`|gAhHCpRNaa	get cavity backs. if you want ones that are good to look at i recommend the titleist AP2. well i think its the ap2 the black ones. im scratch and i play them they are great.|`|sJznih8raa	cavitys. i've been playing with cleveland cg2s since november and love them. check them out, tgw's got them for about $370. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tgw.com/customer/category/product.jsp?SUBCATEGORY_ID=5633" rel="nofollow">http://www.tgw.com/customer/category/pro...</a>|`|jwm0kQvNaa	if you can hit the sweet spot consistently, get blades (or MB's)- the increased workability will bring more variety to your game.<br>  <br>  if you can't- get cavity backs.  The forgiveness they provide will help you when you aren't hitting them your best.<br>  <br>  The Forged CB's are good clubs.  You won't find many that are cavity backs without some offset.  <br>  <br>  You could also look at the Wilson Ci7's, they have a thin topline and thin sole, though from pictures I have a hard time telling how much offset they have.  <br>  <br>  You could also try the Ping i10's... the "player's" version of the G10.  Thin soles and topline, minimal offset.  They're cast, not forged, however.<br>  <br>  If you go with Callaway's, you're goiing to have to reshaft them.  Callaway only offers "unilflex" steel (except in the Tour versions) and those shafts are junk.  They'r esupposed to be "for every golfer", but that's the biggest lie, apart from "the straightest, longest driver EVER".|`|wYGeg0QRaa	TB there is a natural order to changing golf equipment to become a better player and it's a good idea to follow the plan to avoid getting ahead of yourself. If you have been playing with off set game improvement irons the next step would be to progress to cavity backed non off set irons that are still perimeter weighted and can give you some forgiveness on off centre contact. The next step from there would be to progress once more to muscle back non off set irons with a thin top line aka players blades. These irons offer you the feedback necessary to fine tune your swing and become adept at controlling the ball flight. The Cobras are a real nice set and you should give yourself a little bit of time to adjust to the new irons and take this step as part of your learning experience. Good luck with the new clubs.

2bKgIMSsaa	Warning to other members....long post...ignore if you are easily bored.<br>  <br>  First off, before I get to your question, I just want to say that I can't believe people report you for anything, Evan. Sheesh... You would have to be the most inoffensive user on here. I hope you appeal  when you're reported, because I seriously doubt you've ever said anything that is genuinely reportable. *Hug* to you in sympathy of being reported. Whoever reported you is probably just jealous that you are a kind and decent person, and they may not be.<br>  Anyway, on to your question, as I said in an answer to another question, I am not really a cricket fan, although I don't DISlike cricket, but I really like the Cricket section on here. I think there are a few reasons that this section is special. <br>  Firstly, there are a lot of very regular users, so you always know that when you come here, you will see people who are familiar. A lot of the regular ones are also nice people, which is another good point. In some other sections, there are a lot of regular users, but people don't seem to get to know each other as much as here. That might be partly to do with people being reported for 'chatting' in other sections, which doesn't seem to happen in this one. People chat back and forth here, and it's good to see that no-one reports it, because I think that's part of the reason why people get to know each other so well. In other sections, people are often reported for that, so it becomes easier to just answer the question and not chat back and forth at all.<br>  Another thing that I think makes this section good is that people are all talking about the same thing, overall. In a lot of other sections, there are a lot of random questions which usually aren't related to each other in any way. In this section, because it is a team sport, there are certain things happening in those teams, so everyone on here is talking about what is currently happening with each team, eg. who is playing, how they are doing, and so on. That might apply to other sections on here that are on the topic of team sports, too, but I'm not sure. Anyway, I think that is also a part of what makes this section good. <br>  Another good thing about the Cricket section is that there's always entertainment in the form of quizzes, etc., and I might add that I have never been able to answer one yet, but I like to see other people answering them, and also the 'Tom and Jerry show', as Fahad calls it. lol <br>  On the question of how to keep the romantic character of the section, I think people just have to get along together as well as possible and discourage/ignore any troublemakers. It's a good idea to look at the reasons why troublemakers post the questions they do. In this section, it seems to me that it is usually to promote anger towards members from another country, usually India or Australia. To look further into their motives, a few are genuine racists on both sides, but I believe that most are just angry about something that is happening in cricket, so they try to promote anger about it so they won't be the only one who is angry. They want to provoke an angry response, and that is usually what they get. In my opinion, the best thing to do is to just ignore those questions, because that is the only way to succeed against people who want a reaction. <br>  Well, I just thought I'd answer this question since I'm not really a cricket fan but I like this section. This question got me thinking about the reasons why I like it.<br>  Anyway, sorry this is so long. I know, when I post it, it is going to look as long as a book. lol Sorry, again. Hope it helps to answer your question.<br>  <br>  Added:- Great answer from Arsalan. lol @ 'thumb pain'!|`|Ezk53Ifmaa	Yes exactly. This is a rare section. Most people actually know each other. The only thing is, we have these people... Ashish *cough* and Ashish haters which flame the section which then repel the better users who are here for cricket, when all this section is sometimes is an absolute joke. Especially on Sunday (aussie time), MBTM's Goat, MBTM's Parents etc were all on, asking questions not related to cricket. <br>  <br>  2nd category.<br>  <br>  I will stick in there though. Ignore the idiots.|`|SWxnbKyyaa	This section is different in the sense that you find interaction with other users to be friendly, you get a real feel.Maybe thats why I'm attached to the cricket section although I'm not knowledgeable enough nor am I an ardent cricket fan.Its great interacting with users all over the world.<br>  <br>  And I miss some of the users you have said, hope they come back.<br>  <br>  also I belong to 40- category<br>  <br>  Edit- There has been fun as well,the fun component has also made a great difference.|`|YVUM2s6Baa	How exactly is this section different from the other sections?<br>  This section is best among the best and worst among the worst. I feel the people who have left might be following silently what is going on in cricket section. I hope they will come back.<br>  <br>  What can we do to keep this romantic character of the section?<br>  Just Ignore the troll Qs. If nobody replies, they will stop posting the non-sense.<br>  <br>  I am 25.|`|OdMZtz7Zaa	This section is very good . i have got many friends here. That is why i spent my most of time in this section.<br>  22 Years..|`|4VoQduaZaa	Evan sir .. it's sad to hear that even your replies are being reported. I hope you are fighting back on that. <br>  <br>  For me, I don't think anybody would call me an active user as I do not write much here. Probably most of the section does not know me. But I know almost each one here as I happen to read all the stuff written here. As you have correctly said, this group is like a small railway station where people know each other and have fun together, have petty arguments and even fight over things. But at the end of the day, it's all in good spirit.<br>  <br>  And then, we have lot of characters ..  good and bad. Some of them actually make this section look better. But the bad ones create nuisance. It is very irritating to go through 20 'personal abuse' questions to find one question really related to cricket. And then, some of the good users get pulled in these discussion and answer the trolls in their language. The trolls are waiting for this and start reporting those good users. I think the best option is to ignore these questions and report when you can (not sure if that is always possible). <br>  <br>  One nice thing I have noticed is there are no TDs for any of the answers on this question. I am not sure how long it will stay like that. But it proves that this section is still that nice small railway station. All is not lost. There is hope.<br>  <br>  By the way, it is good that you asked the age question now. Few more years and my answer to that will change :-))|`|c55c5f3a196f9a316536bb93ba268636aa	This section has a sense of exuberance, something refreshing to say the least. If u see my profile, i made this account of mine in jan 2007, and i remember coming to this exact section then. And funny as it sounds now, i found it very boring indeed!!! There was no social interaction, no frequent users, not many jokers around and it did seem like a sort of "dead" section. <br>  How times change !!!<br>  I came back to this section only around the start of this yr, after a hiatus of around 2yrs. And i immediately felt a sense of regret not coming back earlier. All the regular users seemed to know each other, it is like a close-knit family. I could have gone to any other sports section like football, tennis, instead of cricket (all these sports are my fav), but something drew me to come here, a certain charm, possibly the "village railway station" charm as u put it! <br>  <br>  Btw, i come in the latter age grp.(19)|`|cOm8LQ1Daa	I agree with u, Evan sir!! Many users left...CJ, Astreix, Ravii, Jassu, Montitude, Furioso Lion, Kookee, BhejaFry, Incredible Indian, Adarsh (saw his question some days back but he still isn't active over here), etc.....Missing them all!!! <br>  Cric sec is probably the best section in Y!A cos people know each other here.....The agruements, fights, ego clashes, passion, fun, etc...over here is not available in any other section! It's a crazy li'l world of cric fans!!! Just love it over here....<br>  However, there are trolls and other trouble-makers too...but good & evil are co-related, u can't avoid it!!! Romantic character of this sec will be retained only if people stop reporting & suspending each other's account! Li'l bit of fun question or answer is okay but limits shouldn't be crossed!  <br>  <br>  I belong to the later group (16 yrs)|`|bN6S0FJEaa	People may take wrong decisions in frustration or anger. They know better than us why they are leaving this section.  I was suspeded too, but it didn't make any difference to me.  I am still here (who cares about points, levels and tags) asking, asnwering and having a good time with people like you.<br>  <br>  We need to stop the hatred between each other, stop abusing or passing racial comments which has nothing to do with Cricket.<br>  <br>  I am below 40.|`|AU9r15xEaa	it is totally different section from anyother section on yahoo<br>  <br>  im 40 - (18 years ) <br>   nothing more|`|AA12027343	I totally agree with you on the fact that it is more important to actually express yourself and ask what you want to know from others, than to be worried about the points or level....I think we have reached such a stage in this category of cricket, that we can ask each other anything, as a friend, not as a questioner. That's what Y! Answers is all about...sharing your feelings.<br>  This section is different because, there are only so many people in Y! Answers who actually know what cricket is all about, and love the game to the core. Since it's a small group with common interests, people tend to know each other well, and can easily relate to them.<br>  In sections like Entertainment or Music, there are trillions of people participating, because atleast 3/4th of the world's population knows all about entertainment and music. So it's a broad category...but since Cricket doesn't have any sub-categories like, say entertainment or music does (rock, pop, folk etc), everyone knows and loves each other here..(OK, not necessarily love, but atleast we really DO know each other)...<br>  <br>  We should stop fighting with each other and realise that we have a common interest and love : for cricket. That makes us collectively a common people as well. We should keep this in mind before writing anything negative...and this is how we can preserve the Romanticism.<br>  <br>  I come in the age group of below 40...definitely.|`|M8XmhqIhaa	Well this section has a certain charm to it. Most of the time its well behaved and everyone has a good time but sometimes it can really be a disaster, full of trolls and harassment of other teams and other people. I've been in this section since February 2008, and the harassment and the troll activity has always been here since I started.<br>  <br>  The arguments, at times, are quite fun to watch (as long as they don't go over the limits). Otherwise, the section would be really boring.<br>  <br>  Btw, I fall under the 40- group. (15 years old)|`|AA11088802	What i think. There r many reasons of cricket section's in n outs. Cricket followed by young generation. N young generation look like very emotional n show much petriotism. Which hurt other. What i think u wil find the same attitude in basket bal section (as they showed b4). I think u can find peace in sections where nationality , competetion and immaturity would not involve. N the only solution of cricket section's problem is that. We consider every1 a member of our family. N win or los is the part of game dont take it personally n abuse the winners. May b im wrong.

But it goes through phases like this believe it or not. Sometimes i come on here all the time and answer a stack of Q's other times i just don't feel like it. Life will be pumped back in to the section soon, i might try and convince some others to come back as well.<br>  <br>  I am 40-.<br>  Oh and i don't drink tea or smoke, lol<br>  And may i quote to all the users here from Norman Stanley Fletcher from the sitcom "Porridge"<br>  <br>  "Don't let the bastards grind you down"|`|wPlfPc0gaa	It is quite alarming that most of the users are leaving the section either by their own or after their account getting suspended. Even Kookee's absence is quite conspicuous. But I think he has not left the section and will be back soon.<br>  <br>  Yes, we here are closely knit and we are bound by cricket. Most of us are open-minded to the diverse views and tries to keep a cordial relationship with others. We deal with each other as if we know them for years.<br>  <br>  We can do nothing to stop the 'flame-baiting'. The ones who create trouble will keep creating troubles. No way stopping them.<br>  <br>  I am well below 40.
hMkb7H31aa	Suggest the best way for you to receive a reliable answer to your question - <br>  You take the next six months visiting every ballpark and making a personal survey of the "action" and the fan's opinions - male and female.  Call it the "Major League Ballpark Poop Poll".  Don't even pay attention to the action of the field.  Your concentration is on the action in the johns. <br>  <br>  You may even follow individual fans from the concessions stand to their seats and then to the restroom - timing the affect of eating sausages/nachos/peanuts/candy and slopping it down with coke or beer.<br>  <br>  At the end of your survey and conclusions, submit your report to Bud Selig so he can digest and deposit it in his dumper.     : )|`|GWoW1o5oaa	The one that sells the most food is most likely the one.

nRBC4E5saa	The basic techniques:<br>  <br>  Punches:Jab, Cross, Hook, Uppercut<br>  <br>  Kicks: Front Kick, Round Kick<br>  <br>  Takedowns: Single leg, Double leg, Hip Throw, Inside Trip, Outside Trip, Ankle Pick, Bodylock throw<br>  <br>  Positions: Guard (on your back with your opponent trapped between your legs), Half Guard (on your back with one of your opponent's legs trapped between both of yours), Side Control (lying on top of your opponent, face down, perpendicular and chest-to-chest), Mount (straddling your opponent's waist or chest), Rear Mount (straddling the opponent's lower back, using your legs to control his hips)<br>  <br>  Locks (mostly on the ground): Guillotine (front) choke, Rear Naked Choke, Arm Triangle Choke, (Leg) Triangle Choke, Straight Arm Bar, Americana (upward shoulder crank), Kimura (downward shoulder crank), Omaplata (shoulder crank with legs), Knee Bar, Achilles Lock, Toe Hold (twisting ankle lock using the toes as leverage), Heel Hook (twisting leg lock using the heel as leverage)<br>  <br>  Tactics: sprawl and brawl (defending takedowns and using strikes to win), clinch fighting (using clinch tactics to tie up your opponent and strike them), ground and pound (using takedowns to get on top of your opponent and strike them), submission fighting (taking the fight to the ground with the hope of catching the opponent in a submission hold)<br>  <br>  You will usually wear gi pants or board or grappling shorts during training, as well as teeshirts or rash guards.  You will use fingerless, open-palm 4oz gloves for competition and some training, and usually more padded gloves of a similar design for sparring.  You should also wear a cup and a mouth piece.  Some guys also train with wrestling head gear so they don't get cauliflower ears.  Some training will also require you to wear boxing sparring gloves (16 oz) and shin pads, and maybe a sparring helmet of the style used in amateur boxing matches.<br>  <br>  As for the UFC:<br>  <br>  There are five weight classes: Heavyweight (206-265lbs), Light Heavyweight (186-205lbs), Middleweight (171-185lbs), Welterweight (156-170lbs), and Lightweight (146-155lbs).  Most fighters cut weight, so with the exception of Heavyweight, most of them weigh in at the upper limit of their weight class.  Due to a complicated situation, the UFC currently has a HW champ (Brock Lesnar, who has a strong wrestling background) and an interim HW champ (Frank Mir, known for his submission/Brazilian Jiujitsu background).  They will fight in the coming months to unify the title.  Other champs are Rashad Evans (LHW, good boxing and wrestling), Anderson Silva (MW, great striking, clinch fighting, and some ground work), Georges St-Pierre (WW, background in karate, wrestling, and BJJ), and BJ Penn (LW, great BJJ with good boxing).|`|6p9I889Iaa	striking, clinch, ground fighting.|`|CYyjz4Mlaa	the training is very hard i've been training and fighting for 3 years in northern ireland. it involves alot of press ups, sit ups, break falls, hand stands, round house kicking, boxing, judo, bjj, wrestling, high and low paced running, squats. the best advice i can give is buy some good deep heat and stick at it once you learn the basics it gets easier.<br>  good luck<br>  train hard fight easy|`|q7emij33aa	wrestling, grappling, jiu jitsu, muy thai, boxing, kickboxing.. <br>  <br>  Go to www.sherdog.com..<br>  <br>  Watch UFC, old Pride videos, anything you can get your hands on. <br>  <br>  Barnes and Noble has a MMA sub-section in the sports section.

To be a Main Eventer you need to do it All.|`|PfF1ufDoaa	Sadly there isn't a whole lot of managers around and no WWE managers come to mind aside from Rajin Singh and he doesn't do much. I think they should call up Byron Saxton (aka Bryan J. Kelly) he's one of the best managers going around today.|`|6ueL0gkAaa	There will always be room in wrestling for managers. Its just for whatever reason WWE and TNA dont use them anymore, which is a shame.|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	I totally agree with you. A good manager can really make a wrestler. Plus it adds a different dimension to it. What about Slick, he was great. Bring back the managers I say. Wonder why they don't have them anymore.

gilK0i8Maa	If it EVER did, it would have been very early on in its history. consider that when it was still played as a break away form of  rugby , the team in possession of the ball would have , say, 5 possessions with running as the only option, no forward pass, unless it was punted away, as in the rugby league as it  is played now, except it is played with 6 possessions....|`|YlBLz9lTaa	its three downs
unx2SqI9aa	Didn't deserve it at all, I watched that like 20 times during the game as they got Rudy off the court. Seemed like a big drama stunt to me, just like Pierce "hurting" his knee in the finals to make a big reappearance 1 quarter later to pump up the crowd.<br>  <br>  Trevor got the ball, end of story, wasn't trying to hurt him. It was a good foul... That was ridiculous. I could understand a flagrant 1... not a damn flagrant 2 and ejection though.... BS. I don't know how that was even such a big deal. Just a really bad looking fall, not a bad foul...|`|IeNv33iNaa	I agree with all of you guys, he got the ball!  Clearly he was going for the block.  If Rudy had landed on his feet none of this would have happened, foul, maybe a flagrant 1.  He got ejected because of the landing, not the foul.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	These people are joking right? It was a blow from behind as Fernandez went up for the dunk. He deserved the ejection and deserves a 3 game suspension. NO CLASS|`|MTbgg5eyaa	If you would see the play over and over again, there was clearly no intention of tackling down Rudy hard.<br>  <br>  Whatever happened to the law of gravity?<br>  You jump hard, you hit something, you come down hard.<br>  <br>  Ariza was going for the ball, and accidentally hit Rudy's neck.<br>  For Rudy to get the foul called, he waved his hand in mid-air just to lose his balance and go down hard. He totally lost control because he exaggerated.<br>  <br>  Now, remember, in a Laker game, a certain opposing player was trying to tackle down Ariza while on a fastbreak? The same thing happened. The opponent held the head instead of the ball, but instead of Ariza exaggerating the play, he used his hands to gain ground and fell hard, partly because of the foul, but mostly because of the law of gravity, you come up hard, you go down hard.|`|FUoKu13Daa	One of the reason why they have two types of flagrant is to see if players are going for the ball or trying to hurt a player.  I do not think he meant to hurt Rudy but he did hit part of the head and cause him to fall,<br>  <br>  There are many interpretation of this foul type. and sometimes after the game Stu Jackson who monitors these types of fouls might upgrade a flagrant foul or downgrade it.  So Ariza foul might get down graded to #1.<br>  <br>  But one of the things that they take into account is a  score of a game, how much time is left and if the game is out of reach like a blowout game.  The Lakers were down by 30 and sometimes the official might take into account that the game is out of reach and that a hard foul is not necessary especially when someone gets hurt.  If it is a close game and it might determine a victory or defeat then they have a little more latitude for a hard foul.<br>  <br>  But that fact is a player had to be carted out and the NBA has to make a stand to protect a player that is up in the air because they can get seriously hurt as we saw already this season with Wallace even though that was a little bit different.|`|yt05KPhBaa	He was just hustling. It's unfortunate but he did hit the head. I don't agree with the call though. Trevor made a good attempt even in a terrible situation but they think it wasn't necessary. I'd do the same thing if I could.|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	Thats why I say the NBA to me is a joke. All the players care about is scoring the most points and making the most money. At least in college basketball they play as a team, like the sport should be played.|`|m501HwyWaa	everything in the nba happens so fast <br>  that ariza just didnt want rudy to score so easily<br>  but i also think rudy was trying to flop|`|kZuktZ3iaa	I thought it was a play on the ball.<br>  I mean, he's had the exact same thing happen to him in the air and just got a personal.<br>  Flagrant 1 at the most.  Only reason they gave hima flagrant 2 was because rudy got hurt. <br>  <br>  Anyways, I really hope he's okay. I don't like to see ANY player get injured.|`|UYPfC5YVaa	Yes he deserves it even though it wasn't intentional. His foul hurt an opposing player.|`|WUzgGtAAaa	He was clearly going for the block.|`|H8FHx1HYaa	it's not intentional his going for the block|`|BFOOOzwBaa	i dont think it was from arizas little love tap but because a fight broke out and he caused it|`|7e6Vm4cDaa	no, it's just a hard foul...and it's unintentional.|`|hMSVmJN5aa	youre right it looked like a block to me<br>  <br>  he didnt deserve it...|`|tZ2ipbVJaa	i dont think so

Just doing all kinds of things. As you get better make them harder to do and at faster speeds without looking. <br>  <br>  Also watch a lot of one on one stuff (watch how any of the players in the NBA or college get space)<br>  <br>  The best way to get space is to practice in game type scenarios. Play one on one or just play basketball all day. It will help. There's not magic way to improve, just practicing by yourself and playing to get used to those practiced skills in the game.|`|BFOOOzwBaa	you dont need nobody to help you<br>  remember starting off always look down to help you place ball right<br>  all first practice basic between the leg alot once you got that down<br>  keep doin it make it so you can move alot while your doing it now walk all around the court btween the legs behind the back spin do every thing you taught yoself but now keep lookin at the goal while your doing it to keep your focus on your game sooner or later you will have it down thats how i taught myself <br>  all can do is dribble and dunk my shot is horrible and i dont even no why|`|xZigibGYaa	usually the best move to get by someone is the crossover.  you should definitely start dribbling up and back with the left hand...and do it fast and finish on both ends with left handed lay ups.  as far as agilities, you should run suicides and touch the lines.  this will get your speed and quickness up.  lastly, study the moves both kobe and cp do, because they are two totally different styles.|`|QlcGYKs4aa	find somebody who is a really good defender and practice against them. also the reason kobe and cp3 are so good is because they work hard at being that good. but remember u can't just be an offensive guy. u gotta be able to play D too.|`|j6NImFHgaa	basketballdrills.homestead.com<br>  <br>  <br>  www.basketball-drills-and-plays.com/ba... <br>  <br>  <br>  www.bestbasketballdrills.com/basketbal... <br>  <br>  <br>  www.eBasketballCoach.com      <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AA10232540	Contrary to the "experts" opinions voiced so far, serrated knives *can not* be maintained by a non-cutler.  The entire design of the serrations themselves creates an edge that can NOT be resharpened without damaging the original edge.<br>  <br>  Serrations can be "sharpened" either of two ways:  one is to use a round file or ceramic rod to hit each and every groove in the serrated blade.  That requires that your rod be the exact same diameter as the one that serrations were originally cut with.  If it's not the exact same diam, it will widen the serration's teeth on every sharpening.  You'll go from say, nine serrations to eight slightly wider ones.  Seven even wider ones etc.  But even if the stone/rod/file is exactly the same diam as the original tool, the tool will tend to cut the serrations deeper into the blade without truly sharpening any of them.  Serrated blades can be thought of as disposable blades because of that.<br>  <br>  Tactical knives like those you pointed out can only be used one way.  A straight fist grip with the edge away from you.  That makes cutting rope pretty easy (the usual example given to why you need that particular knife), but how many folks buy a pocketknife to cut rope?  In everything besides cutting rope, that design is garbage.  It won't fit your hand to peel an apple.  It won't fit your hand to clean your nails.  It won't fit your hand to cut a steak.  It won't fit your hand to open an envelope etc.  It's only good for that one thing....cutting rope.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is you skip the tactical crap and go for an Old Timer or a Buck or an Uncle Henry etc.<br>  <br>  Addendum Brewmeister:  You *can* technically sharpen serrations, Brew.  Yes.  But as I said, you can't maintain a serrated edge as is and you can't sharpen one without damaging or totally destroying the original edge.  It can't be done.  <br>  <br>  Try this as an exercise, bud....use a ruler and a quarter and draw yourself a line of say, ten serrations onto a sheet of printer paper.  Get them straight.  Just use your ruler and coin to draw ten circles side by side.  Next, use your ruler again and draw a line through the points of your serrations about oh, 1/8" of the way so that there's 1/8" of the points drawn through.  That's damaged/dull serrations.  Next, use your ruler and that same quarter to redraw your serrations to the point that they have actual points again.  How much steel did you have to grind off? Redrawing the serrations is you sharpening them.<br>  <br>  Serrations can *only* be "sharpened one of two ways....either you cut them deeper into the blade or you cut them wider.  Both methods destroy the original factory edge.|`|QrjuueMCaa	My everyday carry knife is a Kershaw 1660, but for at the cabin and when I need a slasher, I use my Spyder that has a half non and half serrated blade. Serrated blades are no good for skinning/gutting game, but good for everything else that doesn't need a clean cut. (for example, serrated knives rip through rope and other materials with ease). For hunting, (gutting/skinning) I have a Benchmade Black that is perfect for me.|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	If this is going to be your every day pocket knife I would get the half serated knife.

I've yet to find any kind of stainless that can hold an edge half as long as tool steel.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Mine is acutally half-serrated, and half smooth.  The serrated makes a saw-type cut for going through tough material like sinew and tendons (or nylon strap and rope).|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Get serrated, they cut better.<br>  <br>  But they don't have a half and half?|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Get the second one, and you get both serrated and plain, as can be seen in the photo.  The plain half closest to the point is what you will use for skinning anyway.  You can use the half closest to the handle for tough cutting jobs.<br>  <br>  You won't have any trouble sharpening the serrated part.  Of course, it will stay sharp 10x longer than the smooth part, but when it comes time, any decent sporting goods store has a serrated knife sharpening tool for sale, and they aren't expensive.|`|AA11570394	Serrated blades work much better for cutting wet rope or even dry rope and tough fabric. They also work well for cutting vines and woody stemmed plants. But as for butchering meat they tend to rip the meat as the cut.

My survival knife is partly serrated near the hand guard. However my skinning knives, butcher knives and capeing knives are not serrated.<br>  <br>  So it depends on what you want the knife for.

YrxLbfiIaa	If your not too familiar with firearms I say get a new one.....<br>  <br>  The Remington 870 shotgun is available in several models with prices starting around $250 in most area's.... I don't know what your budget is but for most folks $250 isn't a huge sum of money so consider a new one.....<br>  <br>  This standard Remington 870 Express is the least expensive model I know of and its a good value....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.remington.com/products/firearms/shotguns/model_870/model_870_express.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.remington.com/products/firear...</a><br>  <br>  I should point out the Remington 870 is hugely popular with legions of fans that own these fine guns.... I happen to prefer Mossbergs but if you are somehwat familiar with the 870 then surely purchase one.... NO one ever was disappointed owning an 870 so rest assured it's a good choice....|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Yes, buy Used and Save $$$.* A New shotgun doesn't shoot any better than a good Used one.* Let the other guy pay the New Price, You Pay the Used Price and Save a Maximum of 35 to 40 %..* I bought all 26 of mine used with no regrets whatsoever, and saved a lot of $$$$.*|`|Y4RS35M7aa	You'll find so many 870s at the show, it'll be hard to resist.  They have them, as I'm sure you know, in all kinds of kits and configurations at the show.  If I was buying a used one, I'd want a good deal, like the extra rifled/slug barrel thrown in, or a tactical stock or magazine  provided, or something!  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your fine shotgun!|`|QC2NozBkaa	The used ones may be better than new.  As you cycle the action through use they actually smooth up some.  An abused firearm is usually easy to spot as they are all beat up.  I've had good luck buying used firearms so I say  go for it.|`|h2f6j0yiaa	I don't like used weapon because you don't know how people used it.

Hawks play as one, Cats played as eighteen...the "team" won that day and will continue to do so.<br>  <br>  (Which is why Geelong were so successful in 2008: they were a team and the pride of that city by Corio Bay until the boys got it into their heads it was all a foregone conclusion.)<br>  <br>  Having said that, Collingwood thumped the Cats last year and tomorrow will be a tight match.  Unusually for Aussies I am indifferent to Collingwood, (I love the Cats, like the Hawks/Tigers/Eagles, couldn't care either way for the others, and hate hate HATE Port Power), so best of luck to you for 2009 and tomorrow.<br>  <br>  I hope, with a resurgent Geelong, you'll be needing it.<br>  <br>  ;-)|`|BQ7rS5m2aa	You can ramble on all you want  about how Collingwood could have won so many premierships, reversing the win:loss ratio and so on but the thing is, thats beyond the point, you have won 14 and lost 28 and that's that, lol.<br>  <br>  I admit, Collingwood have a great history and I respect it and the club itself, but supporters really need to let go of the past.

Collingwood has contested 42 Grand Finals, (unequaled by any other club) won 14 and lost 28.   Reverse that result and NO AFL club comes anywhere near them.  Bob Rose lost 3 grand finals by a total of 15 pts. Tom Hafey who won 4 flags at Richmond, then LOST, 4 at Collingwood, and Mick Malthouse, who won 2 flags at West Coast and has LOST 2 at Collingwood and missed playing in another by 5 points . Two experienced  coach's equally successful with their previous club and equally "UNSUCCESFUL" at COLLINGWOOD , how is that explained, the mind Boggles.  Had both Hafey and Malthouse won flags at Collingwood the Pies would have 20 flags wins, 4 more than their nearest rival, and if you add the 3 Rose lost, that's 7.  The AFL has for many years wanted  and worked hard for equalisation, and maybe its reasonable  to assume, it has come at Collingwood's expense ?    Collingwood has won 3 NAB cup games in ' 09, by an average of 44 pts, while the 3 teams they played received more free kicks, in each game, which just makes you wonder which club the AFL will be ON, and will FAVOUR for the silverware on Friday night, its as simple as that.|`|5mS4lMkGaa	The CATS!!!! sure we lost to Hawthorn last year and maybe we played crap but this year the cats will be hungry for that cup and Hawthorn will have a hangover just you watch Collingwood Vs Geelong in the 2009 AFL Grand Final.|`|QGY8BYS7aa	Love Collingwood. Not being biased or anything but Collingwood look really sharp. They are one of the favs to win the premiership.|`|uJvs4Xnraa	Crows!<br>  Seriously... the best teams as long as their has been a national competition would probably be West Coast and Brisbane... honorable mentions for the title include my Crows, Essendon, and maybe Geelong.|`|vcaFkuphaa	Why would you ask the question if your not taking any answers besides Collingwood, you ******* tard!!<br>  <br>  It was University but now i would have to say Essendon!!|`|kIEUTLIdaa	Got to say bombers as well!!!

SleL3Cuyaa	Rafael Nadal born the 3 of June of 1986. Rafael Nadal Parera is from Manacor, Majorca, Spain and he is a tennis player breaker that none can beat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  He is a totally born winner, a killer of the courts and an amazing sportsman and person with a lot of energy and vitality. He can play with two hands, but it is well known that his left one is the best.<br>  <br>  <br>  Rafa won his first tennis championship when he was 8 years old. He belongs to a family of sportsmen. Rafael Nadal uncle Miguel was player of the Majorca and the FC Barcelona. And his trainer is his own uncle Toni who was a professional player of tennis. Toni began to prepare to Rafael Nadal being this a boy. For the player, the training of their uncle have been decisive. “It demands much to me, I guess that for being of my family. He has taught to me everything, and mainly to being better person”. Says Rafael Nadal about his uncle and trainer. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This young guy called Rafael Nadal has all the skills to become the number one of the world.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to know more about him, visit Rafael Nadal Biography to know more about him and his family, you also can visit Rafael Nadal Pictures to see some photos and videos|`|K4lRi1fjaa	G'day Kate,<br>  <br>  Thank you for your question.<br>  <br>  He was born in Mallorca Spain and started playing tennis at three.

AA11110524	we will probably always call "world football" soccer, just because we have to call it something. but trust me americans never discuss soccer its just not part of our culture, never has been i dont know if it ever will be, at least not anytime soon we dont care for it. on the other hand there is only one football that we talk about and thats "american football" as you guys like to call, which is understandable because you guys call "soccer" football like the rest of the world.|`|fzzkDo3saa	I am American, and I will tell you that there is no way that we will  ever call soccer football.  We won't join you, it is just not something that us Americans will do.  I mean we are one of the few countries in the world that is not on the metric system, so that is a good indicator of how likely we are to change.<br>  <br>  The pro football league here (NFL) makes over $1 billion a year in revenue and is by far the most popular sport here in the US.  As a matter of fact I am embarassed that baseball is still called America's game, it isn't.<br>  <br>  Wanting us to start calling soccer football, and football something else is just wishful thinking and is not going to happen anytime soon, if ever.|`|wxXguyK3aa	I don't think we will ever call soccer football.  We're too stubborn.<br>  <br>  I'm too used to it, also.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Buy all the NFL big guns vacation homes in South Aussie.|`|paIUgtLRaa	Sorry, but us "yanks" will never call soccer, "football".<br>  <br>  Yeah, you play soccer with your feet, but when has the English language ever made any sense?<br>  <br>  I have several old friends who live in Australia now (a couple in Gladstone and two others in Brisbane, and one in Tweeds) but I don't know why soccer is called soccer, and why the rest of the world insists on us changing. We like our gallon unit of liquid measure, the inch, foot, yard, and mile for our unit of length, and pounds for our unit of measure for weight.<br>  <br>  No onimosity in this answer, just a simple answer.|`|fyKSTMAfaa	Americans don't like to confuse themselves, and they're certainly not about to change the name of a sport that's been an American institution for over half a century for the sake of being politically correct and appeasing international "football" fans.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure why American football is called "football", as it's actually more similar to rugby.  But that's the way it is.  And it isn't going to change.|`|yzKrwvxSaa	your from victoria, right?<br>  in N.S.W we refer to football as NRL<br>  im not from the U.S but i know a lot about their sport<br>  and im pretty sure that they dont follow soccer that much and american football is their main sport that uses a football so they just call it football.|`|AA11565799	We get this question with some frequency.  In the US football is what you probably call gridiron.  What you call AFL is probably rugby in the US and what the Europeans and Africans call football, we call soccer.  I was on a train going home from work and heard two guys with South African accents sitting across from me talking about "hookers."  As I learned later that is the guy in the middle of the scrum in rugby, not a prostitute as the term generally means here.  My point is that we have different tastes in sport.  Like it or not.  Australia and the US at least share baseball, which seems to be growing in popularity in your country.  The Europeans don't know what to make of it.  The LA Galaxy of the MLS, the pro soccer league in the US, brought in David Beckham to generate interest in the sport.  You may have noticed that Beckham liked earning $25 million a year but he clearly does not like being irrelevant.  He came to the US to discover that no one gives a rat's rump about his sport except for immigrants and no one has heard  the term spice girl in 12 years.  He grew bored of anonymity and manipulated his way to AC Milan.  <br>  Next subject:  Why we call the baseball championship the world series.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Soccer is soccer and boring by whatever name you call it.  Football will never be changed in the US.  Get use to it.

Z5xgSATSaa	Most brands of bikes at a given price use similar parts, so general reliability is going to be similar. What really counts is the quality of the store where you buy your bike, how well it was assembled and adjusted, and how well they look after you after you buy. Check the spec sheets for two similar bikes at about the same price, a large percentage of the components will be the same.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	they all make good bikes. i prefer specialized|`|BqonQfreaa	I had a Trek 820, which is a cheap Trek, for over 15 years and more than 20,000 miles.  I would say that is reliable.  I recently got a new mountain bike, a Raleigh Mojave 8.0, which I am extremely happy with.  I would stay away from Cannondale and even Marin as there aren't as many places to get them serviced.  I also know a lot of people who have been really unhappy with their Cannondales.  Paying for the name and not necessarily quality.|`|NK94egwqaa	All those 4 brands are pretty good. Cannondale use lots of special parts so spares are hard to come by, but the other 3 use standard parts. You will struggle to find a difference in terms of quality and reliability between all of the brands but I am personally a fan (and owner) of marin bikes.|`|HgBvRwjraa	Um all are gonna be reliable bikes if you take care of the bike good.

He may have to miss a few games but innocent until proven guilty.<br>  <br>  If he is guilty ... what a shame.<br>  <br>  And in advance I will apologise on behalf of the (idiot) doggie supporters who will be giving him crap if he does play.

He assaulted a young girl and has been charged Nrl should make him sit out the year,at least. He is a bloody disgrace to the league no matter how good a footballer.|`|uKoAMJQvaa	If innocent straight after the case is heard. If guilty  it will be in the hands of the NRL if they register him again. I just hope that the truth comes out and not trial by media, for both parties concerned|`|tH6z3JKWaa	Not this year, pretty sure about that. According to news report after the incident, the police took a swab from the girl for dna testing and also took scrapings from underneath Brett Stewart's finger nails. Given that he has now being charged with sexual assault one doesn't have to be a genius to work out where those fingers had been. It doesn't look good for Brett.<br>  The sad part about it all is that I'm sure he would not be in this situation now if his critical mental faculties and judgement hadn't gone awol thru being rotten drunk, and really that's a warning to every male ( not just footballers) about the trouble you can get yourself in thru binge drinking, when you get so pissed you have no real awareness of what you are doing.|`|d6fAyYQ1aa	There is no excuse for any person been assaulted be it male or female<br>   I do know first hand that some women think it is so wonderful to know a top sportsperson that they will throw them-self at them not worrying about the consequences as I was involved with a football club for many years.Now they both have to pay the piper.<br>  <br>  She should be locked up and the key thrown away.<br>  He should be made pay for his part also.|`|96bVfIlYaa	If he is guilty they should throw the book at him! <br>  <br>  I can't understand how a footballer who has such a great career in front of him, who also appears to have a beautiful girlfriend and, as said by a Manly supporter the other night, "he is King in Manly, he could pull any girl he wants to"  would want to rape a 17 year old. <br>  <br>  How to make footballers more accountable and go easy on the booze??  ........  For once don't sweep the evidence down the drain as has been down before with high profile people, let one pay the price for once.   Only then will it sink in that maybe they won't get let off the hook and maybe they need to keep their drinking, egos (and willies?)under control.|`|1JD5g518aa	this weekend because this 17 yo **** didnt get her baby bonus shes trying to get money some other way.and maybe it was her dads fault as he has been charged a few times with fraud.fancy not knowing someone so famous living in the same complex.what a load of ---p.cops do what they like whether his guilty or not.obviously shes a minor and a girl (no disrespect to other decent 17 yo girls) so she gets all the favouritism. my opinion anyway.yes and i do hate cops.and by the way the dna results aren't back yet it takes 7 days;and by the way you can just grab someone to push away and your dna can be  found on that person. it doesn't mean he assualted her.how do i know? its happened to me.|`|yr9GMHqaaa	He has been charged, not convicted yet...if convicted he/ his club may not have a choice on how long he is out for- courts will decide that- as a high profile person, they may make an example of him.<br>  <br>  If it is just an accusation that turns out to be false or unproven, then Manly/ NRL should be able to get him to play without too much delay but in the meantime is a PR disaster...........how long before these guys learn not to put themselves in these situations ?|`|qCh1jVNhaa	WHOOP 5 months!!! Good news for me :D. Anyways i agree he is a great player but ive never liked him. If he is found guilty he will NEVER play in the NRL again. No place in sports for criminals. I know all you die hard manly and NSW supporters are pissed (id be pissed if matty bowen was charged with something like this) but seriously no matter if she agreed to go into the room with him or anything if he continued after she said no, its a crime. Just because he is a footy star doesn't put him above the law. If he is found guilty i hope he rots in jail for what he has done. And rolly lets see how long you last if cops didnt exist, you should thank them for keeping order and risking their lives for ungrateful people like you.|`|xQ0hiLBHaa	i wouldnt mind being in a unit complex staircase with him<br>  <br>  ;)|`|HTKRKwYXaa	Well, pending his court case, that will be up to his club and the NRL. If found innocent, he should be playing straight away. If he is guilty, well, that depends on the seriousness of the charge(s).<br>  <br>  Difficult to say really, I won't trust the media for the facts, wait for his court case and see what happens.|`|xCiaczM5aa	Go to love how apparently shes never seen him before yet lives in the same complex and happens to be out the front "smoking" before all this happens.<br>  <br>  If his guilty sure throw the book at him but if shes trying to accuse someone because of there famous stature she should be throw in jail instead.|`|9D93rMEEaa	I have always been a huge Manly fan, and Brett Stewart fan for the last couple of years, so I am hoping it is mistaken identity or something, but if her did assault the young lady, I hope the book gets thrown at him, or whoever did it to her.|`|AA11463909	now we talk .. he is proven and charged guilty so he is GUILTY !! don't ask how long but say : NO PLACE IN OUR SPORT FOR SUCH PEOPLE!! he is an example for big numbers of young fans.. i don't want my kids to watch him drink assaulting others then to be called a star ! <br>  <br>  don't think in your team think just THE RIGHT THING OK? wedon'tt want him back and i wish that we still have justice ( am sure we do ) to kick him out  for ever ! not only him but any one of the roleModels stars in Australia .....|`|xvT4Ag56aa	if gets charged throw his **** in jail, who gives a **** about football he asault a teenage girl,  these mindless thugs need to answer to someone they are not above the law|`|mdSQhCHJaa	Hopefully not long he's got too much talent to waste <br>  bt if he really did do it than yeh he shud get wt he deserves regardless of how wasted he was.....|`|NujOlXpQaa	Hopefully he will continue to train with the team and be back on the field shortly after his court hearing on 7 April.|`|L5Cfvq53aa	Rolly i agree with you totally...probably a set up|`|kM8J2Dtiaa	i hope never ,slimey ground critter

WWE cherishes they're relationship with they're long time superstars like Shawn and Taker and last year Flair and when push comes to shove alot of the decision making is in they're hands.<br>  Undertaker stated after Wrestlemania 18 when he beat Ric Flair on some radio show that the WWE had pretty much given him all the power in the world when it comes to Wrestlemania and when the time came if Undertaker was ready to have his streak ended he would get to choose how it went down.  They gave Ric that same authority last summer when he started thinking about his retirement and Ric Flair, much like The Undertaker isn't about to be a stepping stone for anyone trying to make a name for themselves.  Who did Flair choose to end his career? Shawn or a newb? He chose Shawn because he respects Shawn and knew that if he was going to get beaten, he was going to get beaten he was going to get beaten by the best.<br>  Shawn Michaels just last year ended the 30+ year career or argubly the greatest preformer that ever graced the ring and for some reason people are laughing at the idea he may defeat The Undertaker, now I am not going to sit here and argue with anyone and I know people will post back believing that The Undertaker will be around forever but the fact is the real world isn't like that, and the fake world of wrestling isn't like that either, somewhere down the road Undertaker probably will lose at Wrestlemania, it's just something that had to happen.  I mean if Batista beat him at Wrestlemania 23 would you feel ripped off...Yeah I bet you would... If A-Train and Big Show beat him at Wrestlemania 19 would you feel ripped off? Yeah I bet you would... If Mark Henry would have beat him at Wrestlemania 22 would you have felt ripped off? Yeah youre damn right you would have... But when Shawn Michaels ended Ric Flairs career did you feel ripped off? NO! Even though we all loved Flair and hated to see him go we knew that there was no one better to do the job than Shawn Michaels and Ric knew that too... Ric hand picked Shawn and he picked him because he knew what we all know... Shawn Michaels is the best is the best in the business today and if you want to go out in a big way then you go one on one with the ShowStopper on the grandest stage of em' all.   Would you feel ripped off is Shawn Michaels and the Deadman put on the best match of theyre careers and HBK nails Taker with Sweet Chin Music and ends the streak??? You can be stubborn, you can be spiteful and you can believe that WWE is going to have some newbie like DiBiase JR or something beat Taker in a few years and make a name for himself...or you can look at the facts and see that this is the FIRST time Takers streak has ever been in such danger of ending becaue theyre is a 50/50 chance Undertaker hand picked HBK just like Flair did... <br>  <br>  So in my opinion and you all may think it is a long shot and sure it will be wierd even for me to know Takers streak is over.....but Shawn Michaels ends the streak at Wrestlemania 25!|`|77b5BDf3aa	OMG this has been asked like 20 times.<br>  <br>  The Undertaker will win. 17-0.<br>  <br>  It will be like a 45 to 1 hour match.<br>  <br>  HBK will come close to winning and both men will be tired as hell and barley be able to stand up.<br>  <br>  But like Vince has said time and time again The streak won't end. He also said if it is decided to let someone break the streak then it will be by a young superstar to give a huge boost to their career. Shawn is not a young star who has a whole career in front of him lol.<br>  <br>  Will be a great match. I predict Undertaker will get to 20-0. Then Retire or then the streak will break.|`|16352a635caa6fb60fdec93601a1467daa	Well from what i hear Undertaker will be retiring this year, i would like him to win, but like Ric Flair, i think Shawn may be ending yet another good run at Mania this year. Not to say i don't like him, i love HBK, but i think he's wats going to end the phenoms career.|`|6ueL0gkAaa	The Undertaker.

nRBC4E5saa	To my knowledge, the Estoc (or "tuck") was the only sword designed to combat plate armor.  It had no edge.  Instead, it was straight with a triangular cross-section.  I'm assuming that you are familiar with plate armor to begin with, so I don't have to explain how ineffective a bladed weapon would be against it.  A piercing attack is really the only way you're going to combat the armor itself.  In that vein, perhaps other sword designs, like a strong rapier, might do some damage against plate armor, but a sword isn't your ideal weapon to combat that particular threat.|`|oTb67zNYaa	1. a point heavy one concuss him then stab for a joint 2. or go strait for the joints with a lighter stabbing sword then you have my favorite 3. draw him in with single handed sword and shield getting him into position for my associate with a long ax to kill him from behind battle was not just about one on one fights most of the time you work as a group or army if you will also this does not apply to mounted warfare not these strategies at least for the sake of your answer lets say german longsword or claymore for1. a spatha for 2. and a nord sword with round shield strapped variety for 3.|`|444cc0a50021891de69824c19550f54daa	none<br>  the plate armor was designed specifically to defend a fighter from swords<br>  they tested a few of these on national geographics' perfect weapon series only to find that indeed you can't penetrate a piece of plate armor with a sword<br>  bulkier weapons like a hammer or a halberd could were much better suited towards this purpose mainly due to the shear mass of the weapons and the fact that they usually had spikes on them specifically designed for this purpose

He is known for his runs on the right flank, crosses and vigorous defending, also contributing with a fair share of goals from his position.<br>  <br>  <br>  A graduate of Sevilla FC's prolific youth system, Ramos began his career as a right-sided defender, a position he was able to keep for the majority of his early career. He made his first-team debut on 1 February 2004, not yet 18, in a 0-1 defeat at Deportivo de La Coru?a. In his first full season, he was an undisputed first-choice, as the Andalusia outfit finished sixth.<br>  After two years of experience in La Liga, Ramos became known for his ability to play in any defensive position. In September 2005, after having still featured in one game for Sevilla in 2005-06, playing 90 minutes of a 1-0 home success over Racing de Santander, Real Madrid signed him for €27 million, on an eight-year deal.This transfer made him the third most expensive teenager behind Wayne Rooney.|`|2db9fe86ea55aa997103dc6a4b16bc02aa	ofcourse sergio ramos(spanish)plays for real madrid.<br>  <br>  My favourite player is marek jankulovski:D:D He's the best defender and midfielder at the same time.|`|F3faAmsSaa	I have Argentina's player, Plays In Atletico madrid<br>  <br>  My Favorite player is Ronaldinho(No, i'm not brazillian)|`|YzBVbvyWaa	Yes I have heard of him..<br>  <br>  My favourite player is Cristiano Ronaldo|`|E3KJSB0paa	yes ive heard of him my favourite player is the great jim denny

iNqN0pp9aa	If you want just one or two marlin then don't buy a rig. You are going to have to travel to warmer waters to find them.<br>  I would suggest Cabo San Lucas in Mexico. They have the best average for catch per boat. I don't know what it is now but it used to be about 1 fish per boat per day. (Other places might be 1 fish per boat per week or more) <br>  Go in late summer. It will be hot and it is chibasco season (huracanes) but it is the best time for marlin. If you can talk the skipper into going out real early you have a chance at Wahoo. You will also see yellowfin tuna and Dorado (Mahi Mahi) and close to shore, I mean 100 feet, you can find roosterfish and amberjack. <br>  This is not going to be cheap by any means but it is a trip of a lifetime. You will have to charter a boat there and they will have the tackle. I would make sure that they are using Penn Internationals like a 50 SW reel with 50 # test. If you go out to buy this rig yourself you are looking at about $600 for the reel, $300 for the roller rod and $100 for just the fishing line alone. I have several marlin lures and the most expensive one ran me about $100.00!!!<br>  You can charter a cruiser which will hold 4 guys comfortably or a panga, which is a smaller boat like a big overgrown stout row boat, for 2 or 3 people. I have no idea what the cost is any more but it isn't cheap. Then again, all of Cabo is not cheap anymore.<br>  I started going down there when it was still a small fishing village. That was the early 80s.<br>  When you are down there see if the Oso Blanco is still around.

zFTSg47waa	To be really technical, a scratch is only when the cue ball is pocketed (see first link). However, the cue ball flying off the table is a foul. It is not a loss of game unless you also pocketed the 8 ball on the same shot (see second link). These are per world-standardized WPA rules.|`|e47cbd3118a83a04556f34a880185c45aa	yes and a loss .when the cue ball leaves the table it is counted as a scratch unless you are doing a jump and when shooting the 8-ball a scratch is a loss|`|JGjwHrqAaa	If the cue ball goes off the table it is a scratch. Any scratch while on the eight ball is a loss. If a object ball goes off the table then that ball gets spotted on the spot where u rack.but yea cue off the table is a scratch.plus loss when on the 8|`|9XnPp2jmaa	It's a scratch and a loss, if you scratch, no matter what, it's a loss who ever turn it is to shoot for the 8-ball. But if your playing with Friends who aren't too serious then I'm sure they'll let it slide.|`|8044a7bd2bb393b88020b2acea00a3daaa	It's a scratch....<br>  but it also depends on how serious the players are taking the game they are shooting|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Yup. It is a scratch.
kv4ksj1Taa	Which New York Yankees have signed the ball?
fyKSTMAfaa	Sure.  I think they can win a few games.  In the NFL these days, there isn't that much difference between 6-10 and 0-16.  Just ask the Falcons and Dolphins how thin that line is.  They were 2-14 and 1-15 respectively.  They hired new coaches, brought in a few new players, and brought in new QBs.  And went from cellar dwellars to the playoffs.  <br>  <br>  I don't think the Lions will stage a turnaround that dramatic.  But I think with a new coach, new attitude, and some new talent, they can win five or six games.|`|iSIZMz2maa	They should. You'd think after going 0-16 they'd be super motivated. So yeah they probably can win 3-5 at least, there div. isn't that tough, very mediocre.|`|BBEBPxOaaa	Well you can't go 0-16 two years in a row. Ummmm ,can you?|`|bsKdgkJbaa	Yes....More than 3.....I think about 8 if not more.......|`|44WWNpo4aa	no|`|BlgZmV6uaa	yes|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Yes. I'll go with the others and say a maximum of 5 wins.|`|yg3Pveakaa	Yes i think it can go to the maximum 5 wins..|`|WUuO6wbAaa	I don't think there's an excuse why any team can't win at least 3 games, if not at least 5, in any given year. We all know the Detroit Lions will be the equivalent of the Pirates or Orioles to baseball. That's obvious. But they need to show signs of improvement. They have enough talent to win 4-6 games, but I don't know if they will. If I were betting, I'd probably bet on 2-3 at most.|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Depends if they draft smartly.  I can't see them being as poor as they were last season though, they have new coaching and some new apsects to their team.  They should win more than 3.|`|4ec0a31b1f8ce574de49a57391c919f9aa	well if they were smart and drafted an OT...and brought jeff garcia back for a 2 year deal...they would win at least 6...but they arent smart enough to do that it seems|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Yes. I'm betting on a minimum of 4 wins for the Detroit Lions, with a max of 6.

Also, he is going to be replaced by another keeper in the Italian squad. <br>  <br>  He doesn't have marketing power even near to Beckham's, Kaka's or Ronaldo's. Beckham is being offered no more than $15 million, so there is no question of offering $300 million to Buffon.|`|LcgPiuRLaa	No. Lets look at others<br>  Toldo to Inter 2001 (30 yrs old for 10 million euro)<br>  Peruzzi to Lazio 1999 (29 yrs for 18 million euro)<br>  Buffon to Juve         (23 yrs for 32 million euro)<br>  <br>  <br>  Looking at that , i'd say 15-25 million euro would seem fair considering hes older than all above|`|IJvwYe1yaa	No player is worth that in the worlds economy.

gBO908P6aa	Hitting your shins with objects is NOT the proper way to condition the bone.  You're causing bumps, knots and other problems by doing that.  The better and safer way is to kick the heavy bag and Thai pads.  Gradually the bone will become accustomed to the impact and will adjust to it. Any bone under repeated stress will grow denser over time.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	Jake Lo method is the safer one<br>  using other methods or can lead to shin splints. and they can be painful|`|gJzEAvNTaa	helps condition shin|`|rOA44SLuaa	In Muay Thai it helps A LOT. In Thailand Muay Thai practitioners kick banana trees to deaden their nerves and harden there bones. When your bones go through trauma they heal back and becomes stronger. That means when you are in a fight you can kick really hard without worrying about your shin breaking or feeling pain.|`|W0NpcICwaa	many people say that rolling a stick or any other hard object on the shin makes it stronger.i also tried it and had great results.dont hit roll the object.<br>            there are many kicks in muay-thai like roundhouse kick  those are kicked with shin.so how much strong is ur shin that much is ur kick's power.|`|TbEwkoQDaa	You'll have a strong physique and you couldn't feel so much pain when you're hit.|`|EK0ecGkqaa	When you "shin train" you are breaking the bones on your shin,so when it heals the bones will merge together thus creating a calasis.<br>  <br>  this training is maily used in Mui thai or Olympic sparring.If you want to do this training i reccomend getting a clothes hanger and wrapping it around your hand then bashing it agaist your leg,but dont do it to much do it atleast 10 times then stop for the day.

And if it always hurts, you might like to consider switching (at least partially) to ice dance instead of freestyle.|`|lnRMmSeyaa	when your skating you could be twisting your knee when going to jump which would cause all of the pain, make sure your keeping your knees forward, and when you go to land make sure your bend your knee and ankle, or the pressure could hurt your knee, theres really nothing your can do to build strong knees, if you really wanted too you could wear a knee brace and that would make it feel better<br>  <br>  figure skater of 6 years <3

Njom1Wbtaa	Oh, Lebron James and Dwayne Wade will be my choice. <br>  <br>  I know Kobe is playing great also on this season with or without Andrew Bynum, but this year is for these two, Lebron and Wade.<br>  <br>  Lebron James, I'm not surprise at all of his scoring output, but what makes me astound is his influence on Mo Williams. Before the trade talk, and even before the season, you will see Lebron James wants to win. After experiencing lost after lost, and one way or two way away from the championship, he has now matured, he evolved not just on his game, but on intangibles.<br>  <br>  Dwayne Wade, with all due respect to Michael Beasley, if Dwayne Wade is out for the most part of the season, the Miami Heat will still be a laughing stock in the NBA. Chalmers helped them a lot, so as Shawn, but Dwayne Wade's passion to the game and fervor of the willingness to win is the reason where they are now.<br>  <br>  "What separates a good player and a great player is not only statistics, but also the love for itself, teammates and for the game."|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Kobe and Wade.|`|5FypDafWaa	wade and lebron|`|4DcvpQXfaa	LeBron and Kobe|`|bSnIqvdmaa	My answer would be Wade and LeBron.<br>  <br>  HOW COULD KOBE BE IN THE RACE IF YOU HAD PAU GASOL AT ONE TIME AT THE TOP TEN!<br>  <br>  THIS IS MADNESS!!!!<br>  <br>  NBA writers are so biased. Team record blah blah blah. What? That's why you call him MVP, because of what the PLAYER does for the TEAM, not what teammates do for your team too.<br>  <br>  Why LeBron? Because LeBron simply does it all. He's a near one-man show with significantly better teammates than Wade.<br>  <br>  And why Wade should win? Because HE IS A ONE MAN SHOW. No cavalry to sweep the mess for him. No Pau Gasol. No Mo Williams. No Fisher. No Delonte. NOTHING! He has Chalmers, Quinn, BEASLEY, O'Neal the smaller and D-Wright; they have nothing against the likes of Delonte, Ilgauskas, Wallace, Gasol, Odom.<br>  <br>  Ok, Kobe is a good player and all of them make their teammates better. But Pau does make his team better just on his own, just like how Odom or Fisher does. Same is for  Mo Williams. Wade has nothing. He's in mentoring mode. He's just being patient with his team. And he plays with a passionate heart, not the one to stammer and blame the opponent or even your own teammates.<br>  <br>  I say give emphasis on the team record, but only less.<br>  I say let's look at the effort more.<br>  I say let's look at the stats more.<br>  I say check the intangibles.<br>  I say look more into the percentage of things they do for the team.<br>  I say we assume what happens if they weren't there.<br>  I say no to Kobe.<br>  I say the NBA writers were sissies.<br>  I say LBJ and DW as the two top candidates for the S-MVP.<br>  I say GIVE Dwyane Wade the AWARD!|`|xtuyRToAaa	Ummm...Wade and LBJ?<br>  <br>  The only people who mentions Kobe's name in MVP voting are his fans.

Bad if it's a heel.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	For me personally as long as the story is strong around the title matches is great then the lenght of the reign doesn't matter but the days of 3 year reigns are long gone. 6 months is about right for a modern reign.|`|VQlrQ34Faa	That would suck. The other wrestlers deserve to have shots and at least hold the titles for a few months.|`|XdQYUC2paa	It all depends if it is a good wrestler with good set of moves.<br>  <br>  Somebody like John Cena holding a title for longer than 3 months which he always seems to do i find boring.

PfF1ufDoaa	The Chuck Palumbo - Jamie Noble feud in 2007/2008, halfway through the feud Noble turned face while Palumbo turned heel.<br>  <br>  and for your other question I believe that would be Randy Orton when he first won the World Heavyweight Championship back in 2004.<br>  <br>  Edit: Randy orton started as a heel winning the title and turned face after Evolution turned on him, he later turned heel again after he lost the title.|`|Rm1zxWQmaa	Last heel/face switch I can remember was Bret Hart vs.Steve Austin.

zFTSg47waa	You should be able to find 2 part epoxies in a lot of places. Check arts and crafts stores or home hardware kind of places. You may need to ask as some places keep these behind the counter. Otherwise, I've used cyanoacrylate (CA) super glues and gels and haven't had too many problems. I prefer Zap A Gap.|`|esLsR6keaa	The only glue I use when replacing tips is Tweeten's Ten Minute Cement.  It's easy to use, no mixing epoxy, and it hold's up well.  You can get it with most cue-tip repair kits, or at billiard supply stores.|`|qsXR5GRBaa	I've been replacing cue tips for the past 15 years and have tried numerous brands of glues and epoxies.  I believe the best is gorilla glue.  It sets quickly and holds forever.

gx4VqmrKaa	hey!<br>  <br>  i HIGHLY DONT recommend it.<br>  i tried it several times and have lost alot! of money through them not fitting.<br>  also if they are from ebay (second hand) even worn once they have started moulding to someone elses foot. its really not a good idea.<br>  if you are willing to take that risk go for it.<br>  in the consearn of your feet they will also bleed and get sore.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  ps; also make sure if you do buy them that they have full ANKLE support or hell and ankle re enforcement!<br>  <br>  <br>  ciao~
VLCUDZlcaa	Im entertaining the thought that we can do a decent job in beating the Cats in the NAB finals....<br>  <br>  The Pies really want an NAB Cup win under their belt and have a strong side to deliver the win.  <br>  <br>  xo GO PIES!! xo|`|xCoG2Qgyaa	Collingwood will win because they have had several games together already as a full team. Geelong's first hit out with everyone and will have to many with a bit of rust.|`|ZlFZtTlmaa	I am an Essendon supporter so I will have to say................. GO THE CATTERS!!!!!!!|`|BQ7rS5m2aa	I sure hope not.|`|Vcqe4xOeaa	Anything's possible - they always match up well against the Cats.  I'm a Cats supporter and it'd be nice to win but hello! its only the NAB cup and I'm not sure I'd WANT to win - going by teams records in the last few years I hope the pies do win and then their season proper crumbles around them !|`|mYmh4a7Zaa	Yes, Collingwood will win on friday night especially having Nick Maxwell back so is ALL AUSTRALIAN Paul Medhurst and so is Dane Swan So we've got winning And Better players than Geelong apart from Ablett theres no one to care about there so going to lose.<br>  GO PIES FOR 2009!!!!!!!!!|`|QGY8BYS7aa	Hey hot pies. I am a Collingwood supporter and I reckon we can win.<br>  Why?<br>  1. Leon davis is in sensational form!<br>  2. We are one of the favs to win the premiership!<br>  3. Medurst is playing!<br>  <br>  Remember what we did to Geelong last year?<br>  Why can't we do it again?|`|aN4SUKkRaa	Being a Geelong supporter I'd like to say no chance, but I've got this funny feeling that they are going to smash the Cats. <br>  However I hope they don't!|`|Dn1VnPmFaa	The only way Collingwood will win on Friday Night is if Geelong allow them to.<br>  <br>     Geelong by 26 pts!!!|`|ff821ce78a4a75250794e181494a8cf9aa	No way will they win! Not if Geelong are at full strength!|`|CG8sDoafaa	i hope not<br>  <br>  they SUCK<br>  <br>  west coast are no 1|`|2s244jGgaa	I certainly think they can, even if they are the underdogs.<br>  They were in a similar position last year when they took on the cats for the first time last season, and they ended up smashing them by over 80 points. Collingwood is capable of beating a team like Geelong, and it can happen on friday night. No, the margin wont be big - but the magpies have proven they can beat any team, regardless of how good or bad they are.|`|4wRyTY9Raa	Anything is possible but i think geelong will win, but only just, collingwood are traveling along very nicely but is only march.
AukGqk17aa	dikembe mutombo|`|21J0IIZbaa	Mutombo is the most likely candidate.|`|GswnLKtQaa	It's Dikembe Mutombo, the guy is 42 and about to retire after this season.<br>  <br>  Maybe Shaq will, he is 37 but it looks like he can play 1-2 more seasons if he wants to.|`|pR0pJNJkaa	I think Jason Kidd should. Maybe Allen Iverson too (that one hurts cause he's my favorite). Mutombo is a good choice too. Steph Marbury.|`|xryhIM8Saa	dikembe mutombo|`|5FypDafWaa	the first guy is right|`|bSnIqvdmaa	Dikembe Mutumbo and SHAQ!!!!<br>  <br>  Iverson is still the killer, maybe not yet the time to pull the plug.
