69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	This 2012 thing based on the Meso-American Long Count Calendar is becoming tedious.  Now I'm just copying-n-pasting my own answers to similar questions:<br>  <br>  People who base their End Times predictions on the Meso-American Long Count Calendar do so because they are ignorant.  This calendar comes to an end in December of 2012 because that is as far along as the people got in their calendar-making before they had to head for the hills.  They were chipping away at stone, not computer generating their calendars.  When enemies, plague or some other natural disaster over took them these people abandoned their work and fled.  Remember, these people failed to predict their own end way before 2012.  Why would anyone believe that they succeeded in predicting our end when they failed to predict their own end, something way more important than anything that could occur in the 21st. Century???<br>  <br>  Other recent End Times predictions that failed:  <br>  <br>  In 1988:  88 reasons why the Rapture may/will be in 1988; July of 1999:  The Great King of Terror will come from the sky… (Nostradamus).  Y2K another non-event.  Just last September:  09/10/2008 the Large Hadron Collider will open up a Black Hole that will swallow up the Universe…<br>  <br>  Doomsayers just love to start scare-tales but have yet to get it right.  Yawn!  <br>  <br>  H<br>  |`|AA10293793	yes, they did practice human sacrifice, but that has no bearing on the question.<br>  <br>  the mayan calendar is a big deal for several reasons:<br>  1 - it's the most accurate ever. i could be wrong, but i believe i heard that it was even more accurate than our own.<br>  2 - 2012 is where it ends. this, along with some profecies, has led some people to expect, not wisdom but the end of the world. <br>  i don't know much in the way of detail, but as i understand it, it has something to do with the planets being aligned with the center of our galaxy, which may or may not be like crossing the equator and may or may not cause the poles to shift. if the poles were to shift, it would in fact, be the end of the world as we know it.<br>  <br>  we know that the poles have shifted before and we know that whatever else the mayans did or did not know they knew their astronomy very well.|`|jKyoKfnoaa	A lot of New-Agers latched onto to the shift of human consciousness idea of the 2012 prediction.  My dog is probably more spiritual then a charlatan but my grandmothers weren't so much so.  As for the comment about human sacrifice, many religions practiced it at some point including christianity.|`|BAxvkkN2aa	Supposedly the December 2012 date is when the mayan calendar predicts is the end of the world via destruction. the iChing calendar supposedly also stops this same year.<br>  <br>  According to some studies I've read, there is a black hole that we will be coming near around that same time.. I'll see if I can locate the article regarding that again. Apparently it is supposed to have some adverse effects on the planet during that time.<br>  <br>  Here is one of the many sites set up specificly for this:<br>  <a href="http://www.december212012.com/articles/mayan/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.december212012.com/articles/m...</a><br>  <br>  But I think I'd take it all with a grain of salt|`|2MLLWOuUaa	The Mayan calendar suggests the end of the world "as we know it". Hooray! I welcome the shift in human consciousness, cause the present one is not working.  As for human sacrifice, what do you think  the Crucifixion was? |`|fCTaBtVGaa	there are just some people out there that think since the Mayan calendar predicted a few things (coincidentally), they think the world will end when it ends. dude that was a long time ago. our calendar ends at 365 days, theirs ends on 1012 no biggie.|`|24gFTcc2aa	1. The Mayan calander has been proven(by science) to be a more exact calander than our present one.<br>  <br>  2. This calander claims the world "as we know it" will come to an end.<br>  That leaves so much room for interpretation.  <br>  <br>  3.  Human sacrifice is practiced in many different ways.

z5vF4a37aa	The Illiad focused a great deal on the Gods because the Ancient Greeks believed heavily in their pantheon of gods. The Olympians, in particular, were key in the regular order of nature and everyday life from the skies to the bedroom. There were gods for almost every aspect of their lives. Iris - the rainbow-haired messenger goddess, Nike - goddess of victory (not tennis shoes), Hermes - male messenger god and ferrier of the souls to Tartarus (and from where we get the FTD logo!).<br>  <br>  Because the Illiad was an epic poem about a prominent city, the gods were naturally "main players", if you will. They saw Troy as a key in their manipulatory games with mortals and Greece was equally key in their proverbial line of sight. When these two countries went to war, it was fairly certain that the Olympians would side with one or the other.<br>  <br>  Comparisons vary, of course, but from my own studies, here are some that you might find useful:<br>  <br>  Achilles was the son of a mortal and a goddess. He was dipped into the river Styx to make him invulnerable to harm and was held by his heel - the only part of him not invulnerable. Unlike the movie, he is fiercely devoted to his lover,(as told by the poet, Ovid) Patrioclus, and when his lover is murdered, he rampages! * Similarly, Artemis sends her hounds to tear Achteon's body to pieces when he saw her bathing nude. This sort of "human" quality of vengeance is seen in many of the gods. In this way - a human way - the gods are VERY similar to the mortals. They're driven by the same emotions and passions.<br>  <br>  Apollo helps the Trojans, Aphrodite is wounded in battle and withdraws completely, Athena guides Menelaus, Hera quarrels with Zeus over who should be the victor in this war - a war started by a goddess (Eris, goddess of discord). At one point, Zeus forbids any of the gods to help either Troy OR Greece and at this point, the focus is shifted back to the mortal heroes such as Paris, Hector, Achilles, Agammenon and others.<br>  <br>  There is love and passion involved for the gods. Aphrodite was chosen by Paris to be the favored goddess, so she rewards him with Helen - and her divine favor. She saves his life in many instances when he chooses to go into battle. Apollo loves the Trojan, Cassandra (from where the phrase "beware Greeks bearing gifts" comes from) and it's that love that both elevates her and dooms Troy (she spurns his love and he curses her with precognitive dreams that no one will believe!). Athena favors Achilles and Odysseus (hero of the Odyssey) and champions them throughout the story. So you see love, passion, revenge, pride and favortism - very "mortal" traits to be certain. <br>  <br>  The gods are different in the most obvious way. While they're still able to be hurt, they are immortal. Involving themselves in this war poses no threat to them. Beyond power levels alone, the gods have no vested interest in the outcome of this particular war - only its heroes. There is speculation that this is because they are indeed immortal and will outlive all involved so what consequence is it?<br>  <br>  If you need more - I can provide it! Mythology is one of my forte's.|`|AA10293793	the gods were like super-humans. they fell in love, got married, had babies, cheated on their wives/ husbands, were vain, petty, vengeful. they went to war, and were part of the battle in a physical sense. they were everything a human can be, only more so. <br>  <br>  why are they focused on as much as the humans? well, they were very much a part of every day life in those days, and especially part of big events such as battles and wars. leaving the gods out of it would have been like leaving the christian od out of the old testament.|`|y5HQIRcAaa	1st, of all there's no such thing is god, and 2nd. your completely delusional could harmful to others.|`|CMKSKIf5aa	BECAUSE IN THE DAYS OF HOMER,THE GODS LIVED WITH PEOPLE,THEY LOOKED HUMAN BUT HAD POWERS
ab7310a9a5e945ea73a991616b24c9d3aa	I didn't know there were so few female atheists. In my small town, most of me and my boyfriend's female friends are atheists.<br>  <br>  <br>  But thinking about it, a lot of females are drawn to "submissive" positions. The church seems like a socially acceptable way to be in that position.|`|9yP43Peiaa	Well im female and atheist. You are right. The male brain is more scientific.., i should rephrase that shouldn't I? Studies suggest that testosterone  influences the scientific part of the brain . Estrogen is said to influence the literary side of the brain.It's just theory but, there are definitely more spiritual women. If not religious women then women who believe in psychic phenomena ect.. Agnostic is a word a woman prefers.. Xtians would dismiss this theory because they are terrified of thories regarding hormonal influences, just in case they realize Gay folk are born gay|`|AA10293793	i haven't noticed female atheists being any rarer. i can't express an opinion on something i haven't observed.<br>  <br>  i will say, i am an atheist (and a female one at that) because god makes no sense. not in any way, and especially not emotional sense. what mother would think fair for her children and their children unto eternity to be punished for what happened in eden? what mother would think it good and just and loving that a still-born or a baby dying unchristened is doomed to hell forever?<br>  i could go on forever, but it's getting late.|`|acc3ff4b078a08ae78be3d669658a55baa	I don't believe they talk about it as much as certain men (although that definitely does not apply to me!!)<br>  <br>  Women are not "respected" if they are confrontational, that's a lot of pressure to be "nice".|`|YB9hxefFaa	I agree with Sunshine. I know more Atheist women than any other "type". And it's not because I'm Atheist. I don't discriminate.|`|AA11149408	I can't make that distinction, especially on this board.

Someone on this forum references the "Demographic Profile of American Atheists and Agnostics" by Barna which indicates that men make up 64% of this group and women 36%. Is the reason cultural or hormonal? If cultural, then there should be some cultures in which men are more religious than women. I know in Islamic countries(I lived in Turkey, Pakistan, and U.A.E. for seven years) men attend the mosque four to ten times as often as women who are given a much smaller balcony and not expected to worship outside the home. Of course, that doesn't mean they are less religious. Interesting question. |`|KUJs1iJBaa	I don't know...<br>  <br>  Curiously, many churches and ministries (mine included) suffer from a shortage of men!<br>  <br>  I think it's just the stereotypes that go along with both atheism and Christianity that sort of block them off from the "opposite" sex.<br>  |`|GSoDCdUEaa	I wish there were more.<br>  However, in my town, nobody cares about discussing anything other than irritating high school gossip.

That's not been my personal experience. <br>  <br>  It is true that a lot of religions really seem to target and condition women into being subservient and gullible. They are being kept uneducated, pregnant with far too many children, and have the fear of god, hellfire and damnation poured into them from childhood onwards, all this rubbish about following and obeying. There is probably some sort of correlation between that and lack of any serious female education in some of the countries where birthrates and religiosity are higher. If they are having a dreary life of hard labour in this life, it is probably comforting to them to believe that they will do better in an afterlife, and that if life is hard it is because god made it that way.<br>  |`|AA10556726	You haven't been here long, have you?

J5NDHBRNaa	It sounds like your mom is making excuses for what she did. She is the one who didn't want to see him anymore, and in the process SHE put your best interests aside, not your father. Now she probably realizes what she did was the wrong thing, but it's too late and now seeing your pain makes her feel guilty (which makes her lash out like that). Also, it may make her feel bad seeing you upset over this because it could look as though you weren't happy with your life/how she raised you. Have another talk with her and let her know how upset she made you by belittling your feelings on a personal matter, but let her know that you still love her and appreciate everything she has done for you. It's best to clear the air on this subject so you can move on and try to build a relationship with your father without your mother's interference (even in the form of snarky comments).<br>  It may seem like now that you're grown you can't have the same relationship with your father, but don't let that discourage you. Of course it won't be exactly the same as if he was around when you grew up, but it's better late than never. You could still build a wonderful relationship with your father and make up for lost time. You should also let him know how much it hurts that he wasn't around, but you understand the difficulty of the situation since your mother wouldn't allow it. <br>  Just remember that nobody is perfect, and these people really love you; sometimes they just don't know how to handle these difficult situations. It is your job to make the best of it and be proactive so you can make your life the best it can be. Good luck.|`|AA10293793	well, the past can't be helped now. so take a deep breath, and go find your father.<br>  get to know him, and decide for yourself what kind of person he is. give him a chance to get involved in your life. he may not take it, and if he doesn't you'll know he isn't worth crying over. he just might though - he certainly wanted to be in your life before.<br>  have a good cry, punch your pillow, and the focus on what you can change - the future.|`|deqX4oQQaa	You're an adult go to him and speak with him yourself personally. And find out what happened from his side there is always two sides to every story. And be ready to forgive and forget he's your biloglogical dad.|`|m0paCAXzaa	Sounds like your mother is angry at him and maybe she was trying to protect you. <br>  <br>  Either way,she should have at least let him seen you and your brother.|`|xMNMOJu2aa	You're over 18.

I'm 22 and adopted (a closed adoption.  that's where the birth mother won't give out very much information) so I know that it must feel like you have some sort of a hole in your heart.  Explain that even though she was hurt by his actions, that you feel a real need to, at least, try to get to know your dad.  You shouldn't suffer for what he did to her.  She did say you could have a relationship with him, however she is not doing her part to make good on that promise.  He deserves to have a chance with you.  It has been 21 years, after all, and people can have a change of heart.  See if  you can't negotiate something.  Best of luck and my heart goes out to you!|`|FCzOjs7Jaa	Unfortunately she's using you and your brother as pawns to hurt your father, and that's not only unfair to you, it's what has caused you your mental distress.  She's been playing into her own hurt and pity for 21 years now, and for you to forge a relationship with your father will be viewed as treason and abandonment of her, even though it is not.  You obviously need to meet him for your own answers, your own welfare, and your mom needs to work out her own issues too, but you are not responsible for her or her issues.  She's the parent and you're the child, and it was wrong of her to use you the way she did, and it was an injustice to you and your brother to deny you anyone in your life, much less your father, that would contribute love and support while you were growing up.  Cut the umbilical cord and go meet your dad.|`|seHLPwA2aa	ok.  if you are 21, make your own choices.  it not up to your mom anymore.  i have two sons, one with my husband one with an ex that walked out one me.  i would never tell him to stay away. ever.  even if he hurt me but leaving all it would do is hurt my son in the end, and thats not okay with me.  it seems like your mom needs to grow up in a sence and see that theres more important things in the world than herself. |`|wA0A3dDaaa	Your a responsible adult.

It's hard for her, because she wants you to have your own "independent" life, but still wants to protect you from the hurt in the world like moms do. <br>  <br>  Your mom associates hurt with your father, so that's why she is insecure with herself while even thinking about him, and therefore why she called you a name. It wasn't anything personal, she was just trying to protect you from him. She loves you with all her heart.<br>  <br>  Stay strong! I hope everything works out.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	.<br>  Insist on seeing him, and do nothing till she complies !|`|0DpCPsiNaa	i can relate to some of that an the only thing i can suggest is getting down on your knees and crying out to God read the Bible he is always listening and ready to help i am going through some sh!t right now and the only friend that i have that can comfort me is Jesus through thick and thin he is there with his hand outstretched waiting for me to grab on i will pray for you and keep your head up<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 10:13 No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it. |`|dfa0f10d091f9f82c584408f50df66a8aa	She is trying whatever desperate method she has to try to prevent you from seeing your father. I think she wants to be the only parent in your life because she wants to punish him for leaving.<br>  <br>  She is using you as a tool and it's unfortunate.

If there were something that bad about your father, normally she would have told it.  Do you have anyone else you can speak with, like an aunt or grandmother or even an older cousin?  I would not accept my mother's excuse like that, but that could be that my mother was a control freak.  She tried to control me until her dying day.  I was in my 60's when she died, but she still had the same attitude.|`|AA12383652	You dont know who your father really is but your mother does.  Maybe she has a really really good reason for him to stay out of your life growing up.<br>  <br>  You are an adult now and I think she should probably tell you those reasons, but for now why dont you give your mother the benefit of the doubt?  You dont know what he put her thru and it might have been more than she thinks you can handle.<br>  <br>  If you cant let this go then find him on your own.  You are 21.  You can do what you want.  
OmSJR5UFaa	If a person of "color" uses the term to address a white person, then yes, it could be construed as racist.  Same as such a person calling a white person a redneck.<br>  <br>  When used by whites referring to other whites, it is not a racist term but is generally considered offensive.  It implies that the person being called that is ignorant and uneducated.<br>  <br>  It's not going to be an "acceptable" term in any case.  It is a slur.<br>  |`|xxDjV6Axaa	It's not a race but some might take offense.  However, there are a segment of people who are proud to be called that.  Those in the mountains, blue grass sections usually.  I've run across those in the south who don't mind that term at all.  Or red neck.  But I would never put a label on someone else.  If someone wants to call themselves something, then that is their perogative.|`|G9R6VZOXaa	Yes, unless their name is Billy and they lived on a hill<br>  <br>  Then you would be ok|`|AA12006309	I think redneck would be more racist than hillbilly... and I live in the south. :D|`|5cQaECAkaa	I think it depends on how it is used.|`|DHzwr1braa	Yep.|`|V5i6A4PTaa	nope...not at all.<br>  <br>  it's a term for a classification of people that seem un or ill-educated.<br>  <br>  many of my family are considered hillbillies - and I tell them that quite frequently.|`|yV5Ds2Swaa	You can't be serious!  What about red neck? How about sh*t kicker? Stump jumper? They are all generalizations. Everything doesn't have to be racial.

It's like calling someone a 'city kid' when their out in the country.<br>  Seriously?<br>  <br>  =/|`|6BbVjgoSaa	no its not racist a hill billy is someone that is uneducated and most of the time dont shop in stores they make there own food and live off of the land|`|yamgD0Mxaa	I believe people like to be called by their names and not by what a stereotype makes them out to "be". So yes its definitely racist and offensive I believe.|`|Ghkz6tS1aa	No, because Hill Billy is not a race? or does not indicate race.<br>  <br>  Any Race could technically be called a Hill Billy.|`|r8jjQzjDaa	Nope because it is a regional reference not a race reference.  <br>  <br>  I am from the South and I can tell you very few people mind the term.|`|0VJMvLMjaa	i think it is

vUJtoXtEaa	Liberialism almost by definition is anti-religion..In fact you cant have liberalism unless you destroy the church.This is the tactic that Stalin used. First thing he did when he came to power was kill off all the clergy...True liberals hold the philosophy that basically they are thier own Gods. There is no intellect higher than them. Problem with this is man by nature are flawed, liberalism at its extreme can lead them to decide who lives and who dies (abortion), whats perversion and whats not pervision (homosexuality). There is no limits to what they can do because again they are thier OWN Gods. Conservatives believe our rights are given to us through our creator (God)..|`|wpuGOnRPaa	From nearly every conservative I've met I've gotten one response: only good things happen to good people. <br>  If something bad happens to you conservatives call you lazy, criminal, or a "sinner".

There is nothing wrong with being conservative.  However, there is something very, very wrong with expecting others to live by your rules and standards.  That is often the case with conservative people, especially the religious right.  I hate to make generalizations, but it's true.  I'm a relatively conservative person, but I draw the line at getting some God complex where I act like my poo doesn't stink.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Europeans expect us to live as they live as much as we expect other countries to live as we do.  It's because humans are very ethnocentric.  We measure others by our way of life, always assuming we are the norm, and the other countries aren't.

EoDeSDnmaa	As a Progressive Believer, I do not think the flood was an actual event, but rather the story had spiritual significance. The flood was a deluge of sin in the world. The ark represented Noah spiritually rising above the sin. I think believers have totally missed the point of the story. Common sense dictates the event could not have happened.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	I think it's an excellent way to present the story. I don't think the story indicates either way the age of the animals Noah collected for the ark...|`|AA10556726	Actually, using infants or young animals has even more problems than using adults.  I doubt that Noah and his family would have time to care for them even if they worked around the clock.<br>  <br>  |`|ypVQlOJvaa	Why bring animals that were incapable of breeding, and take the chance they would not live to adulthood?<br>  <br>  Just because ir's a myth doesn't mean it shouldn't be *slightly* logical.<br>  <br>  .|`|cXXJVz64aa	Stop teaching the kids about fables and start teaching them about things that matter, like morals, money, etc.|`|7hpXsYOCaa	don't forget the baby dinosaurs dear.|`|9mLOH7bpaa	All I can think of when I hear the Noah tale is the offal removal problem.|`|eshummTJaa	much easier to transport babies and eggs, etc....the motion of the ark and the warmth would be like a giant nursery....<br>  <br>  <br>  any one that has grown up on a farm would realize that the best method of transport and containment for that would be a floating nursery....<br>  <br>  the adult animals would make the trip to the ark as God directed them...and give birth or lay eggs...whatever the case maybe...it was taken care of...<br>  <br>  <br>  an excellence example of that direction by God is still evident in the migratory habits of today's creatures around the world...<br>  <br>  <br>  there is abundant evidence of the flood that the evolutionist propaganda discredits every chance they get....<br>  <br>  <br>  since it took Noah around 120 years with his sons to build the ark...people who where living in sin and depravity had plenty of time and foreknowledge to get their act together and stop doing bad things...<br>  <br>  then, as people do today they chose to mock, laugh,and thumb their nose at God....and claim he does not exist...<br>  <br>  they chose to drown in their sins and depravity....<br>  <br>  God passed judgment and they paid the price.....|`|RVsl8ZKfaa	The ark is an impossibility. Even if he only took baby animals, it would've been impossible for him to make an ark big enough to hold all of them.<br>  <br>  [edit:] Also, if he only took baby animals, most mammals would've gone extinct since they need their parents to survive.|`|FMM4HoRJaa	Noah:<br>  <br>  Have you ever taken the time to read the Bible's story of Noah's flood? And have you ever pondered what this story's position in the Bible might actually mean? While there are many people who consider the Bible, and therefore Noah's story, to be literally true, most educated and intelligent people understand that the story of Noah's flood is a myth. They understand that Mt. Everest was never covered in flood water, they understand that the ark could not hold the millions of species that are now found on earth, and they understand that there is no DNA evidence to show that all animals on earth came from single breeding pairs just a few thousand years ago.<br>  <br>  But there is one part of the story of Noah's Ark that deserves special recognition. It shows us something about God that is quite unsettling to any intelligent person who takes the time to consider his actions. That special section is this:<br>  <br>        God senselessly murdered millions of humans and billions of animals in the flood<br>  <br>  How do we know it was senseless? Because "God" is supposed to be "all-knowing" and "all-powerful." If God were to exist, God would know what was coming when he created Adam and Eve. Therefore, God knew he would be murdering millions of people.<br>  <br>  This realization leads to an obvious question: Why didn't God simply speed up Jesus' arrival to avoid the atrocity that is the flood? Or why didn't God program Adam and Eve when he created them to completely circumvent the need for such a horrendous atrocity? <br>  <br>  <br>  Charlie, i am really appreciating your sympathy and awe, of my avatar. <br>  Thanks for the lovely e-mail.<br>   I chose to respond to you on here, because, your e-mail is not to be used by anyone , but you, to send lovely messages to others.

Baby animals? Have you any idea how hard it is to raise a baby anything without its parents? Especially birds and mammals. How did Noah and his family bottle feed the countless numbers of mammalian and bird babies on his ark?<br>  <br>  You only have to introduce a modicum of logic into the story and it falls apart. The real wonder is why fundamentalists can't see it that way. Truly incredible.|`|gy4hYyK2aa	I think that that is a big possibility, though it doesn't say that in the Bible, it's just an opinion. Though it would be smart.<br>  Also, I think that back then, they didn't have as many animals as us. I think that probably, Noah didn't take every breed of animal, just every kind. For example, I don't think he took 2 wolves, 2 Golden Retrievers, 2 Great Danes, 2 Chihuahuas, etc.. he probably just took a common ancestor of all of those(to save even more space), and as they repopulated the earth, different breeds formed. Same goes for African Elephants and Asian Elephants, different kinds of horses, etc...<br>  Note: All of this is just my opinion, I don't think it says anything about the age of the animals or anything in the Bible.<br>   I couldn't find a very good picture of Noah's ark but I put one link in my source|`|tFryrkYHaa	Um..likely not. He probably had juvenile-adult animals for that class could reproduce tri-fold or so, I guess, for whatever  type of species-kingdom they were, with babies you could only watch them grow up  as in the same time, the juvenile-adult class would have babies of it's only securing obviously it's chances of migration.|`|rdEm25fEaa	Sorry, but no. Baby animals doesn't make sense logically. You would need the animals to reproduce immediately after getting off the ark if the species were to survive. You would also need at least 5 more pairs. What if something happened to one of the animals? Whole species gone forev....Damn it! So that's what happened to unicorns!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rosemarycompany.com/media/WhimsicalNoahsArkBabyShowerInvitations1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.rosemarycompany.com/media/Whi...</a>|`|MxNt00z6aa	I tend to think for the larger ones they'd be young, yes. Elephants, dinosaurs.  God's very very smart.<br>  <br>  He also took animals before micro-evolution and significant speciefication.  There were far fewer different animals then than now.|`|uExBtn0xaa	I'm pretty sure he ate all the baby animals and then used their fur/hide/skins to make a collection of belts and jackets for himself. |`|dh2aIYnxaa	He certainly drowned an AWFUL lot of babies, make sure you draw those in too.

Same thing. Yes and No.|`|yl5TPC8Saa	No, no1 can cause physical harm to us legally because of our sexuality. No1 can say we cant use their bathroom because they saw us holding our significant others hand. BUT it still is about being treated equally when it comes to the legal aspect regarding marriage. Our lifestyle not being excepted isn't causing us harm outside of being heartbroken about the fact that we cant get married (right now). I'm not saying not being able to get married is fare by no means because I would love to marry my girl BUT, how does not being able to get married affect our daily lifestyle? We can live a full happy lifestyle without being bothered in public, except when you have the 1 ignorant person blurting things out, but that isn't a normal day to day thing. Each era has things in common BUT i dont think being deprived of our gay rights is as severe.|`|AA10293793	yes. both are denied rights for reasons that are beyond their control.|`|Qys2VYenaa	I don't see why not. both were/are fights for equality. it's just that the rules are kind of different for both.|`|lirHgKbkaa	No, it is not the same thing for a variety of reasons. If you're gay, you can vote, have a good job, sit where you want, drink from the same water fountains, ride the same bus and use the same bus seats, and if you're harmed by someone else, that someone else can be arrested. In the civil rights movement, it involved race. Black people were forced out to low end schools, had different drinking fountains, jobs were harder to find, etc. etc. The Civil Rights movement was much worse and the inequalities were significantly worse than the ones were all in. |`|6d6a921c5c0eccb75bc084215e975098aa	Well, here's one thing you should know about gays. There isn't exactly a place in this world where we aren't discriminated. I think it'll be a long time coming before we can get this whole homophobia thing to pan out.|`|2d798720df19272d2c93262dbfedc5a3aa	No, it's not the same thing but it is parallel.<br>  <br>  Gay people are going through some very similar issues and emotions as Black people a few decades ago (and to a large extent today).<br>  <br>  We are fighting for acceptance, fighting for equality.  We had so many LGBT people killed in the past for who they are.  Not just in the ghettos of Germany, but on the streets of our cities.<br>  <br>  We are not a visible minority, we are closely linked to the civil rights movement.|`|m9LNP93jaa	Yes it is. While we may not have been enslaved for more than a hundred years, we have both had to fight to be free of discrimination and unjust laws. They had to fight for the right to marry other races just as we are fighting to marry the same sex now. There are a great many similarities between the two movements. The only real difference is the history behind each group.

I'm sure that a few people actually do convert from Atheism to Christianity, it's just not as well known.|`|VaWy3DKoaa	I see your point. It's interesting, but I think that is just a misconception. I feel like on average people convert to and from religion equally- actually I take that back. In times of war, hardness, poverty, I think the pendulum swings towards the religion because people are searching for answers to their problems, while during times of peace and wealth no one wants true religion because religion somewhat tells them of what they should not be doing. I tried to do some research on the denominations of the various religions over the last 100 years, but the data would be unreliable even if I found it. Some religions such as catholicism have more children in general, so if it grew in proportion then it would be no indication of conversion. Atheists usually have less moral qualms about abortion so they would generally have fewer children and their population would not grow as large, still indicating nothing about conversion.<br>  <br>  I know many people who through some experience in their lives have chosen to follow a religion. Some people feel something happened that secular logic can't explain. Some were felt they were touched by god. Some discovered happiness through abondonment of posession. <br>  <br>  There are many reasons to convert to a religion, and many reasons to convert out as well. One might feel slighted by a religion, there may be personal misgivings about its practices, one might see a hypocracy that they just could not accept. <br>  <br>  I'm currently trying to believe in god again. I was born a christian but never really connected with the religion, and after many years as an atheist I have recently discovered what christianity can provide my life that I can't. Still, I'm having problems sorting through all of the complexities and wrongs that christianity has, and I'm yet to decide if I will fully commit to my life as a christian or if I will fully commit to atheism.<br>  <br>  |`|TVC7COiOaa	"It seems that Christians may convert to atheism, but atheists will nearly never convert to Christianity. "  Read about the fall of the Roman Empire and the power of Christianity.<br>  <br>  Also according to wiki "Atheism, as an explicit position, can be either the affirmation of the nonexistence of gods,[1] or the rejection of theism.[2] It is also[3] defined more broadly as an absence of belief in deities, or nontheism."<br>  <br>  Also consider that most mainstream Christians and atheists are fighting over the same misconceptions.  One one hand the Christians believe the lies Rome told them as they translated their Bible to fit their greedy doctrines, and Atheists are usually hurt by some Christian and therefore go on a crusade to disillusion their brothers. <br>  <br>  The christian concept of Hell is stolen from every religion then made into a conception of fear so they would blindly follow the corrupt church.  Now Christians are afraid to seek the Truth because the money makers called priests tell them not to for fear of losing their flock.   Right now there is an awesome movement where people are splitting off from the main churches so they worship God by helping each other out (which is why Church, like all government needs to remain very small).  <br>  <br>  As for atheists, I am deist and this allows me take the Atheist argument in hopes the majority for them want a better life free from the ignorance of the past.  True Christianity is like True Science based on reason and facts.  When greedy angry people receive power they stop truth from being spread so they gain money from this kind of conflict.<br>  <br>  The idea of God is a pleasant one because it gives us hope in a world filled with flawed people.  In truth both of your arguments strip people of free will, and believe in God or not we all have free will.  Unfortunately everyone free wills begin to clash and thus we have cause and effect(like this site!).  Now you need a system of Justice and Law to keep people on a reasonable path towards a common goal: freedom for every man. <br>  <br>  But how can any man deal out justice?  He himself must be seen as a source of ethics and wisdom.  One who searches out God for the source of all ethics and that which is beneficial to life(universal), but he also needs to remain realistic and grounded.  So we trust our rich people to deal out Justice and create society and we hope that our scientists and producers are ethical people.<br>  <br>  Hey Atheists if man is given a lot of money will he willingly give it up in the name of truth?  Look at the church and America.  They will bankrupt and destroy their people before they ever admit to being human and making a mistake.  America will send us to our deaths in pointless wars before it ever has an internal ethics inquiry, because of pride.  <br>  <br>  Pride is unethical, and therefore a sin against yourself and your fellow man.  God allows all of this to happen so we can learn from the past and not keep recreating Rome (America again, whoops!).  So Jesus Christ (Christ is from Christos meaning anointed) tells us not to be full of Pride and to help our fellow man, teaching our children bad doctrine is not helping.  Jesus didn't condemn people, they condemn themselves.  After Jesus died the apostles ran away, but came back when things cooled down, even after Jesus told them they would be o.k..  So the apostles came back and did some miracles but mainly hung out with the wealthier citizens.<br>  <br>  But the words of Christ are not literal (he spoke in Greek, English is Latin that is heavy on the German, but the message is still the same.  Christians don't go out and fight atheists, lead a good ethical life and if anyone comes to you for help, help him out.  Kindness should not be based on fear from eternal damnation, but because the guy could help you out later on in life (Ethics!!).<br>  <br>  The idea of an old man sitting on a sea of clouds is a misconception based on mistranslations and propaganda.  Christians read the Bible and meditate on the wisdom to lead a good life instead of preaching about blind faith.  If you believe that God is this whole system of science and math, then there is no point in trying to prove or disprove him.  In fact you become free to life your life to the fullest ethical standards, if not don't be surprised that your unethical behavior gets you beat up or worse: you turn into a greedy politician creating terrorist attacks for more money and power.  You know who you are.<br>  <br>  Since the majority of us are probably not wealthy and more than likely much much poorer than the 10% our goal changes from conflict to create a system that is beneficial to everyone.  Psychology does not lie when its goal is to understand the Ego.<br>  <br>  May you find the truth in peace.<br>  <br>  |`|FCKYpwowaa	You must be really blind.<br>  <br>  Just a few of them:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_former_atheists" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_for...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt_nhoWSRBY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt_nhoWSR...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  |`|YxjggsItaa	Because alot of atheist were once chirstains.<br>  <br>  <br>  but having said that though there are alot of people who are just no sure ( I dont know what you call that but its not the same as atheist)|`|pQTSQ9TIaa	I don't know how high or low the statistic is but they are out there.

VG7k5QRFaa	Do you want to know why it is a sin?  It's a sin, because marriage was created to bind two people who love each other together for life.  Now we have people just taking each other for "test runs" getting "quickies" or having "one night stands."  No matter what you call it, it is obviously a sin.  Here are a bunch more reasons why:<br>  <br>  1.  What if the girl gets pregnant and the father either doesn't want to be involved or can't be found?  Welcome to the world of single motherhood, girl!<br>  <br>  2.  Sex is supposed to be something special that we give up to the person that we truly love as "icing on the cake" so to speak.  Almost like giving someone a Mercedes Benz for Christmas.  What about if your future husband or wife discovered that someone had already unwrapped your package? <br>  <br>  3.  Marriage is a contract that binds the two lovers together for life.  Sex is almost like the signing on the dotted line.  So, if you have sex before you agree to the contract...What?!  Does that make sense?<br>  <br>  4.  If a person gets sex before they're married, why the heck do you want to get married for?  <br>  <br>  5.  Loyalty won't be there...I mean, if the marriage contract is just a piece of legal paper and sex is just something to do to keep yourself happy, then there is no need to be loyal to one person.<br>  <br>  6.  Marriage is a contract.  If there is no need for a contract, there is no need to be exclusive...which means, we can go around the world sleeping with whoever opens his / her legs.  Welcome to either orgy heaven or a rapists' paradise.  Do you truly want to live in this type of world?<br>  <br>  7.  Mother will either end up on Maury searching for her baby's father or will end up on Tyra warning younger viewers not to follow her path.<br>  <br>  8.  Marriage is about self sacrifice in favor of another--which is why one waits till marriage out of respect for your future partner.  Having sex before marriage is like walking into a company and firing whoever you want.  However since your company hasn't bought the other company or doesn't even know if the other company is for sale, makes your firing of their employees a nonsensical, silly and riduculous move. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying people who engage in this act are stupid, I'm saying they are seeking pleasure for themselves and that isn't what sex or marriage is about.   |`|BnANLOCEaa	Sex before marriage?<br>  <br>  Exo 22 Verse 16: And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. <br>  Verse 17: If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.<br>  Deut 20 Verse 7: And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.<br>  1 Cor 7 Verse 36: But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: (but) let them marry.<br>  |`|f3byX86eaa	Forgive me for the cut and paste but I answered a question like this earlier.  <br>  <br>  From a youth pastor prospective it is of great importance to not just say that sex outside of marriage is a sin. That is not the point. The reason God says that is more than to just set up a law. But WHY did God say it is a sin. Because of the dangers (like stds, unwanted pregnancies etc), the way it affects your relationships, how it emotionally ties you to someone that is (lets face facts) probably not going to be with you forever. After all God has a reason for giving laws and that is to protect us from the consequences. The same as he did with Adam and Eve. He didnt tell them not to eat the fruit just because he wanted to set a law but to try and help protect them from the pain and suffering that is brought about by knowing evil. Remember the good ol days when we were young and innocent. How nice it was to not be weighed down by the realization that there is murder, rape, deceit in the world. God was trying to protect our innocence, not to hide knowledge from us as the Devil tried to get us to believe. Really the only knowledge we gained out of that was the realization that there is evil in the world. <br>  |`|AA10293793	sin only exists in the context of religion. in other words, it's a sin because religion says so.<br>  since i'm too old to believe something just because someone says so, and definitely too smart to let someone else make decisions for me, i will have to say who cares if it's a sin? i certainly don't.<br>  religious people have been telling me since i was born that i was hell-bound anyway. why spend my whole life jumping through their hoops, trying to achieve the impossible?<br>  there is nothing wrong with sex before marriage, provided all parties involved are consenting adults and proper precautions are taken as needed.|`|ueP6VXevaa	The act of fornication (all sexual immoralities) is not only a sin against the body, but more so against God.  <br>  <br>  It's like tasting the pie before it is given to you.

Hence the myriad of responses above from atheists who say that pleasure is not a sin and hence pre-marital sex is not only not a sin but ought to be a must for someone who wants to 'try before they buy'. They can say this in full confidence because they recognise no God and so recognise no divine law which can be transgressed...<br>  <br>  However, if you define sin according to the second definition:<br>  <br>  2) an act regarded as a serious or regrettable fault, offence, or omission<br>  <br>  I'm sure there at least a few people who have had unprotected sex with a person resulting in an unwanted pregnancy and then seriously regretted the omission of using a condom! Apparently - that could be understood as a sin ;o)<br>  <br>  In addition, if the Law of the Land defines sex as having a legal age of consent then surely it is at the very least a 'sin' according to the Law of the Land to have pre-marital sex before this age?<br>  <br>  So let us remain consistent - even atheists will understand pre-marital sex to be a sin under given circumstances (men preying on small girls might be one such example).<br>  <br>  To answer this from a Christian perspective is far simpler - fornication is one word used in the Bible in the midst of a myriad of verses which tell us such things as 'fornicators shall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven'. Fornication is defined in the English Dictionary as:<br>  <br>  1) have sexual intercourse with someone one is not married to.<br>  <br>  So very clearly we can say with absolute confidence that, for the Christian, pre-marital sex falls within the category of a divine law and so engaging in it must be described as a sin because the act transgresses the divine Law of God. A Christian recognises divine law as applicable not only for themselves but for all mankind as well - accordingly they feel confident in saying to someone who does this that they are sinning against God (whether they should judge in this way or not is an entirely different matter!).|`|R0NfdgzLaa	it's a sin and if you do it, jesus will know who's been naughty and nice and you won't get any presents on his birthday....?<br>  <br>  i get my fairy tales mixed up sometimes.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	it is fornication, and is under the category of "sexual immorality" sex was a gift from God and he had designed it to be between a man and his wife, to have sex outside of marriage is corrupting something sacred from God, and as it is against God's laws it is a sin.|`|JlDe9RaIaa	God made Love between a MAN and a WOMAN something that is sacred... it something that they can share together... it attaches you to the person you did it with who is supposed to be the one you are married too... if you go around having sex with all these people you become attached to them and you cannot pull away. it is immoral and wrong... and she be saved for the one you marry who should have also saved themselves for you! its good for us spiritually and physically. it just makes sense! <br>  :)|`|FsByX9xxaa	since there is no such thing as sins, how can getting pleasure be wrong?<br>  <br>  I hate religious people that try and tell me I am going to hell cause I have had pre-marital sex.

5RH9Osdsaa	It bothers me a lot that we still live in an age when homophobia is still fairly common.  Homophobia is like racism and sexism in that it is fueled in no small part by ignorance.  I think it is very possible to change a high schoolers perspective.  It happens quite often on college campuses.  The best way to end homophobia is for more people to be out.  When others see how diverse we are and how many of us there really are, many will begin to question the stereotypes and lenses through which they've seen us.<br>  <br>  In regards to your other question, I hate when people use the word "gay" to mean "bad."  My brother used to be a huge offender, but now he doesn't use that word, at least around me.  It is demeaning in a sense and while it may be just words to one person it could be totally devastating to another.  Besides, I don't think we should use characteristics of people to refer to "bad".<br>  <br>  For those that feel this way, however, consider other terms used in your daily language.

Even the gay people that I know aren't bothered by it anymore, with one exception, but he's emotional about everything and would probably get just as worked up over his hair. (Not trying to insult him, just saying that it's not a major issue.)<br>  <br>  Gay as an insult...that's interesting to think about it. I call football players gay because they are all obscenely annoying (and we all know they are homosexual deep down), but that doesn't seem to bother anyone but the jocks. The word only has as much weight as you give it, and people don't seem to give it a whole lot.<br>  <br>  |`|SdxAJNRmaa	I think it is an issue that needs to be addressed more than it is. At  my high school, The principal thinks that there is no homophobia at all when clearly she is wrong.

That is making it a part of our lives (not the everyone should be a homosexual!)  So, that if someone chooses to hi-light homosexuality, being 'gay' or any other variant on it.

If you were lucky enough to have decent physical features, that is a blessing from God and I don't think anyone will be able answer your question adequately because Only God knows why he made your features the way he made them but that doesn't mean you are totally handsome. To get entirely handsome, you must make your mind and spirit as beautiful as your body with your free will. That is something God didn't hand you. You must work for that!. <br>  <br>  I'm also a decent looking person, however I'd like to think that what I had control over, My mind, thoughts, actions and love I show for the rest of the world, are more pleasing to everyone including God, than this body which will die one day and return to the dust from which it came. <br>  <br>  Not really an answer as I said, I don't think a human can answer that for you, but some good points to ponder.|`|sRpX2TFIaa	God made each of us differently, you may think someone is not very attractive and another may think that person is very attractive.

lwHJFfZ2aa	You're correct in seeing that cultural influences do have some serious impact on teenage girls and their behavior. A lot of people have come out against Katy Perry's song because it encourages girls who participate in bisexual acts for boys' attention and, sadly, that's true. It's vogue to be bisexual or bicurious and it's not fair to people who have their true roots in bisexuality or lesbian lifestyles because it creates a sense of novelty for our feelings, desires, behaviors, etc. It's actually an old thing that is getting new attention because of the blatant influences in our culture.<br>  <br>  I don't necessarily think that Lindsay Lohan's relationship is a bad influence on her fans. She hasn't really done anything explicit that could be copied by young girls who don't know what they're doing. I think she is doing a disservice to her fans by not talking about it and being coy. I understand that she may feel an absolute need to maintain her privacy but part of the mystery surrounding the relationship is done deliberately by her. If she is bisexual or lesbian it would be great if she spoke up about her feelings. It would be a chance for her to be a true role model and to actually appear like a grown-up in the public's eyes.<br>  <br>  Why it's considered cool I have no idea. Unfortunately, female sexuality can be easily influenced by outside sources so it's easy for girls to replicate lesbian behavior that is glorified on television. It's stupid and girls may think they're being daring and cool to try something that's "taboo" but it really is just lame.|`|ZzWQHOWWaa	<br>  I definitely do not think that Lindsay Lohan is setting a bad example for her fans. If anything, I think she is setting a good one by being honest with herself and everyone else. If young, gay/bi girls are actually affected by this, maybe it will save them the confusion of admitting their sexuality, because they won't be ashamed, and maybe young straight girls will grow up to be more accepting of the gay community.<br>  <br>  Lesbians and bisexual women/girls are nothing new. I don't think Lindsay Lohan, Katy Perry, or Samantha Ronson have the power to convert millions of heterosexual teenagers. They're not making anyone gay, and I don't think they are intending to. Lindsay Lohan is just living her life, whether it measures up to your standards or not. And as far as Katy Perry is concerned, that song is nothing but annoying.<br>  <br>  |`|m9LNP93jaa	What evidence do you have that these girls are not gay? I see another trend, homosexuality is becoming more acceptable and so more you women are coming out. I do think that Lindsay Lohan is a bad example but my understanding is that she did not start those rumors. The magazines do that for money. I have never heard her say that she is gay but read plenty of times that she has denied that rumor. If you want to accuse these girls of lying, bring some proof. |`|AA10293793	no, i don't agree that lindsay lohan is setting a bad example for her fans, unless by bad example you mean being in a relationship with someone she cares about.|`|tYNHkm6Jaa	Actually, this trend has been happening long before that song and before Lindsay Lohan coming out.  Over the last several years the whole lesbian/bisexual girl thing has become popular and been introduced as a new fad.  I kind of blame those girls gone wild videos that kept getting girls, even straight girls, to kiss each other and making it a popular thing at parties which spread outwards.  And I don't see how Lindsay Lohan is setting a bad example, she can't help being gay, she found a girl she liked and they started going out.<br>  If a girl is already gay its one thing, but this trend seem to be affecting straight girls into acting this way for attention.|`|0WB3SLtUaa	First of all, I don't feel it's any musician or actor's responsibility to "set a good example". Their private lives should be just that. Private. The blame rests on people who try to take social cues from people who make music and movies that they like; that's unwise and that's their problem. And as well as the paparazzi who feels it's their job to report on everything these people do, who probably drive these people to promiscuity and hard drugs in the first place.<br>  <br>  Secondly, there's a chance all these 'influences' have made people aware of alternative sexual preferences, and have looked into what it is that they want and started questioning themselves earlier... better when you're 15 than when you're 40 and married. But it's not -making- people gay because it's not a choice, which has got to be the most obvious fact I've ever seen society refuse to swallow.|`|t1LC6IHkaa	well maybe some girls are making it out to be a joke and they think its cool but some are really lesbian/ bisexual..its fine to be with the same sex.. lesbians/gays/bisexuals are BORN that way they dont just wake up one day and say "oh im gonna be gay today" it doesnt work like that...|`|xewlrOFtaa	It is NOT up to you to decide wether someone is a gay or not! It is things like that that make it harder and harder for people to be true to themselves!|`|oOz38ARDaa	They have nothing to do with it. We've been bi and les before those people were a twinkle in someone's eye. If you want, you could say we were cool before it was cool :)|`|6svwNYM0aa	first off.<br>  lindsay lohan doesnt have any fans<br>  second.<br>  why the hell do you care.|`|A3fcyaGFaa	its a phase !|`|HH90Eghaaa	How exactly do you know they are not really gay? For girls I think its a little harder to tell! We have grow up surrounded by girls images in the media, and it is common for straight women to look at these images and think of the girl as "pretty", or "hot!" No one looks the other way. It makes it extremely difficult for a girl to decide if she feels more then that. I know I had difficulty determining the difference between liking a girl as just a friends and liking her on a different level! Really for some experimentation is the only way to decide. (And yes when I was in my pre teen there was a song I kissed a girl, too Early to Mid 90's!) So please don't label other people as fakers or not really gay, straight, or bi! That's not your decision.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	You behave as if (and come close to saying it) that being bisexual or lesbian is wrong.  I don't see any problems with it at all, and wonder just what your problem with it is?  What's wrong with a little experimentation?  It's not as if girls are likely to give each other STDs or get each other pregnant, is it?  <br>  <br>  I think our culture allows for women to be a lot more experimental and a lot more affectionate with each other than is permissable for men.  I suspect that popular songs merely reflect the truth about this, rather than driving a change.  The same is true with celebs "coming out" about their sexuality.  It merely reflects the changing popular mood, rather than driving it.  <br>  <br>  Sorry, what should Lohan do?  Deny who she is so that other girls won't think it's ok t be truthful about their sexuality?  Great repressive attitude, there.
TfWIcohcaa	I personally believe that religion was created as a primitive form of government for nomadic cultures.<br>  Some believe that religions began as man's way to justify his existence and to give an understanding of how he got here, which may be true to a certain extent, but I think that "what went wrong" was the beginning of using these early ideologies to legislate behavior within a tribe.<br>  Religion may have been very effective during those times, but it is out-dated and dangerous now.|`|dIuOXR11aa	We were influenced by society through the only people we trusted (instinctively) in the defenseless  stages of becoming an adult Homo Sapien  .  That 'influence' can equate to what church had the biggest egos and the most  believers.   Why wonder what went wrong, the human race is fallible.

Each culture developed different, but similar, gods.  There were thousands of them, and they were thought to be responsible for creating the earth, and to govern thunder, lighting, rain, earthquakes, floods, wind, war, love, sun, moon, plants, animals, etc. - everything.<br>  <br>  As people began traveling, they borrowed stories and gods from other cultures.  Some people figured out that they could make a lot of money and gain power by declaring that there was only ONE God, and that his believers were special.  They slaughtered people who didn't obey them and give them their tithe money, so to gain fortune and power.  <br>  <br>  The Church compiled its own official text, claimed it to be from God, and declared knowledge to be evil, so to keep people from learning the history of it and other religions.  Therefore, many people don't know about the thousands of other gods that humans have worshiped throughout history, and all of the similarities.  For example, there are over a dozen virgin-borne, miracle-working, wisdom-teaching, crucified, resurrected, savior man-gods.<br>  <br>  Then the internet and cable TV were invented.

Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.  And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.  And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.  "Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of UNCLEAN LIPS, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts."  Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:  And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.  Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.  And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.  Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.  Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,   And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.

LVQlJ3MVaa	When you read the Bible a few things are evident:<br>  <br>  God does not want to force you to believe in him.  He wants you to choose to love him.  He does not yell out his divinity from the mountaintops.  He whispers it to your heart.  The Bible was not designed as a scientific thesis on divinity.  It is simply a historical account of a cast of thousands of deeply flawed people and their encouters with God throughout centuries.  It is from their shared wisdom derived from all of their many mistakes that we can learn God's purpose for us today.  And one of the themes it reveals is that we don't hear God by stamping our feet like a child and demanding he show himself to us.  We hear him by being still and quiet and patient and listening for the quiet whispers of the Spirit in our hearts.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church assembled the Bible.

Atheism, in itself, doesn't imply any other belief such as the pro-choice stance, feminism or the support for gay marriage. You can be an atheist and oppose all of those things.<br>  <br>  It's just so happens that atheism attracts liberal-minded people who oppose the conservative religious perspective and prefer to think for themselves.

Theism is the belief in got a- is a negating prefix like apolitical, asocial, etc.  so atheism just means that you do not believe in god.  The rest of it is unrelated to the belief in god.

Abortion, gay marriage, etc isn't apart of a religion, it's your own personal morals and ethics. Atheists believe that there is no God, once you die your dead, there is nothing else (no afterlife, etc.). It's just man and the universe. religion is merely created by people to give them hope. People that are atheist tend to start cults, because they believe there is no greater being, and it's just human nature to try and fulfill a god like status.|`|KuJcQbyeaa	There are varying degrees of atheism. It could mean that you are religiously affiliated and just not believe in God, ranging to being completely anti-religion. Atheism is not to be confused with agnosticism, which is simply living along the lines that it is impossible to know whether God exists and to not believe in any direction, so to speak.

A militant atheist is a person who has an agenda and seeks to go about destroying religion and cherished traditions just because they may have a religious connotation to them.  We have militant Christians who do the same thing with people that don't believe in Christianity, and it's just as wrong.  As a point of consideration however you need to realize this:  As an atheist, you have no authority to tell those that are militant to tone it down and knock it off because life and morality are basically meaningless, except what they mean to you.  Thus if you support atheism then support will, by default, assist the militant atheist cause as well.  As a Christian, support to Christianity will also support militant Christians, but we have the authority of the Bible to show the error of a militant Christians ways, and have a strong foundation to truly improve their outlook and the way they should be interacting with others.  Just something to consider.|`|R8sgUX5caa	Atheists don't believe in God. I was an atheist for most of my life until a few weeks ago.<br>  <br>  I won't preach to you, but I'll tell you a story.

In the novel The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky one of the characters goes mad with the idea that there is no God, because to him if there is no God everything goes. You can kill, steal and cheat and you don't have to worry about divine punishment or hell.<br>  I think there is no basis for this belief, because even if you don't believe in God, you know there are consequences to your actions. You can't harm others without expecting retribution from them.<br>  I think you shouldn't worry if you know you are a moral person. There will always be ignorant people who demonize people who have different beliefs. Being an atheist is just the belief that there is no God. And you can believe in a lot of different things to base your morals on. Not all atheists are the same, they are just people like everybody else and there are some good and some bad, just like religious people  <br>  Religious governments are some of the worst in human history.

A person of true education does not assert their values upon the world they only interpret what the world has to offer. You are in no position to make a value judgement about the way someone else speaks. If your a high school language teacher you should consider being less prejudice and learn to interpret the world you have and not the world you want. As a professional linguist at college level, I assure you that the prescriptive grammarian attitude you employ will not allow you to make a no bias assessment of your students speech.

They were all alcohol related incidents... yet I keep drinking...

For example, consider the following from the Quran:<br>  <br>  Qur’an 18:86 “(Zul-Qarnain travelled till) when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it set in a spring of murky water: near it (sun in spring) he found a People” <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/018.qmt.html#018.086" rel="nofollow">http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/018.qm...</a><br>  <br>  This verse is the clearest possible expression of the false belief that many people once held. In Muhammad's day, many people thought that the sun actually set into someplace on the earth (Murky oceans, pit, etc).<br>  <br>  I love to quote this verse (aya) because its the clearest error ever written in any religious book. You simply cant show me (I challenge anyone) any falsehood or error more clearly written or obvious from any religious text. Even the bible's funny "four corners" doesnt touch this one.<br>  <br>  Any way you pathetically try to excuse this verse can also be used to explain any error. Its the "perfect error" and I guarantee that anyone who wants to make sure the translation is correct will, with research, have no doubt about it.|`|zQtrOE6Paa	Look at the ones that already have.

Judeaism only took on its recognisable form in the 7th century BCE, Hinduism 1500 BCE. So the present religions have some way to go before they match that.

But if neither sounds true to you, you shouldn't feel compelled to follow either religion. Following a religion just because you were born into it, does not account to anything.

b4d86f4161f7fd0e73ccc2742d82adeaaa	I feel amused by their ignorance, since Evolution is not part of atheism.  Also, Evolution doesn't claim that people evolved from apes - so their comments prove that it NEEDS to be covered more thoroughly in Science classes, so people won't be so uninformed about what it actually states.<br>  <br>  For the record, I don't think Huckabee was claiming that there are only two choices - although he may not be educated enough to know that there are HUNDREDS of creation theories, and that Evolution has NOTHING to do with the origin of the earth.|`|HBp5r76haa	The truth is, evolution was never an alternative to God when it comes down to explaining the origin of life.<br>  <br>  To darkvelvetrain:<br>  you will be surprised to know that biologist is NOT a branch of science derived from believing in evolution and that a lot of biologists debate the theory.....|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Yes, the choice is yours as to which religion you believe.<br>  <br>  God, who created everything as in Genesis, or <br>  <br>  Evolution - <br>  <br>  Webster's Dictionary defines religion as follows, "Cause, principle or system of beliefs held with ardour and faith." Surely this is an apt description of evolution. Evolution is a 'belief system' i.e. a religion !<br>  <br>  Models of science are subject to change for both creationists and evolutionists. But, the beliefs that these models are built on are not. The problem is that most scientists do not realize that it is the belief (religion) of evolution that is the basis for scientific models (the interpretations, or stories) used to attempt an explanation of the present. Evolutionists are not prepared to change their actual belief that all life can be explained by natural processes and that no God is involved (or even needed). Evolution is a religion to which they are committed. Christians need to wake up to this. <br>  <br>  Evolution is a religion, not a science.<br>  <br>  <:)))>< <br>  |`|M3sVQm2Maa	Yeah, I hate when people use the phrase "believe in" in reference to evolution, as if it's a religion. It's not. And you either accept the theory of evolution, or you do not. I accept the theory, because it's backed up by evidence. <br>  And that hackneyed old line about coming from monkeys is so ignorant it's laughable. It only proves that the person saying it knows absolutely nothing about the theory of evolution.|`|7aCbdHU7aa	I think the vast majority of people who reject evolution refuse to see their faith from another side or a different perspective. Someone who says "If you want to believe you evolved from apes..." is obviously ignorant and close-minded. <br>  <br>  The only two options are "ignorance" and "knowledge". |`|UutLVO2Laa	I think they are showing just how ignorant they are, and I feel embarrassed for them.|`|VsCrYYMeaa	A lot of religious people believe in evolution.  Ok, maybe not the fundies.|`|sL0hAfcaaa	Evolution is backed by evidence. Evolution has been the backbone of new sciences particularly genetics. Evolution has gone through the rigors of peer review and has come out enhanced. It is as strong scientifically as the theory of gravity and the theory of electricity. Evolution actually has evidence to back it. After thousands of years of preachers and prophets forcing their religion on people we have still absolutely no evidence for their wild story's. Religion has failed epically. Its time we buried these superstitions and myths.|`|oPQAPfYXaa	It would appear that the atheists who responded here are in agreement as to how they feel about this sort of inane question.  This Christian - who accepts evolutionary biology as factual, would like to chime in and admit that he has to fight the urge not to bang his head against the nearest wall repeatedly when he hears religious people talking like this.|`|VRVlTVsYaa	Well after all, evolution IS just a THEORY.... kind of like the THEORY of gravity, and "germ" THEORY which states that many sicknesses are actually caused by microscopic organisms.<br>  <br>  I wish people would educate themselves on how much freaking evidence it takes to elevate an idea to the level of scientific theory.|`|74b388eca668facf7bdd1f57af916ab9aa	Its not a matter of belief.  Its a matter of accepting scientific fact.<br>  <br>  Its like saying "you can believe radiation therapy can cure cancer" or "you can believe horses and donkeys can mate and make mules".  Yeah, it happens, there's nothing to deny.<br>  <br>  In fact, an entire branch of science, biology, is based on this reality.|`|lmAhmZfzaa	I laugh at them and wonder if they chose to believe in gravity or if they sit around and pray that God doesn't let them float away.  |`|AA10293793	i think whoever says something like that does not know what they are talking about, and i certainly don't let their opinion register on my radar screen.|`|XKecXwZkaa	I pity them. Education is so important nowadays|`|4DlYbIR5aa	I really could care less what the religious think of my beliefs.  I tend to believe more in the theory of evolution because there is allot more evidence to support it than there is evidence of creation.|`|iiodVRALaa	My family whom I might add are all religious do not say that sort of thing. Instead try to pressure me into being like them and believing in what they believe in which I will not conform to. |`|2YWKeJ6Aaa	i feel funny inside.|`|RBZYVaFLaa	I say okay...because they can choose not to believe it if they want.<br>  <br>  It's not a dictatorship. |`|dlXqtD99aa	Um... God made evolution. Just like he created gravity, protons, electrons, neutrons, hurricanes, brains and other everything else that occurs naturally.<br>  <br>  He chose to start the existence of the world 6000 years ago. That doesn't mean that through our scientific measurements that we can't say the universe is 4.6 billion years old, because he INVENTED physics. He can make all of this stuff change, can we do that? Can we say, oh well protons suck, poof they're gone. No, we aren't so powerful are we.<br>  <br>  Energy/matter cannot be created or destroyed... that's bullcrap. How does any of this exist then? The only LOGICAL answer is God created it. But then who created God? You say people did. Personally I have no idea how God exists, but he does so in a realm so different than you can possibly imagine. Just think of what would happen if physics didn't exist and that's where God exists.<br>  <br>  The real question is though... If the universe is expanding... what is it expanding into?
oUNBdN87aa	<br>  Yes, without the divine, no divine purpose exists. Of course, atheist don't claim they have perceived a divine purpose, merely that they have riddled how to find personal meaning in an essentially meaningless world.<br>  <br>  Straw men can not possible provide you with any real comfort. Why do you use them?|`|KhOx6oTMaa	Someone saying they give themselves purpose is not circular reasoning at all, its saying there is no purpose higher being giving purpose, there is no purpose but what you give yourself. I don't see how you see that as a contradiction. Also, if you'd ever studied quantum physics, then you'd know that the laws of the universe aren't rational.|`|q2x13qDWaa	Nice attempt to speak the atheists' language, but you missed.<br>  <br>  Your flaw lies in not knowing the difference between a human creating a purpose for themself because they decide they want to, and a person deciding that there is a purpose set externally that they discovered.  <br>  <br>  No atheist (that I know) claims that the universe has a purpose separate from humanity that humans can discover.  They believe correctly that all people create their own purposes.<br>  <br>  It's just like a political philosophy.  An atheist or a theist can commit to one, but it doesn't mean they were created by a God.  It's still something subjective to humanity, not objective to the universe.<br>  <br>  Also, i noticed how charitable you were to theists that they only "believe they have a purpose".  In reality, most religious people are pretty (over)confident about their beliefs.|`|wwdllMzYaa	no<br>  <br>  "makes them hypocrites.....I know, the truth hurts sometimes, get used to it."<br>  thats not a nice thing to say, why do people always ruin their qs with mean, rude, comments?<br>  why cant you just ask it, and wait and actually want peoples answers and NOT judge them or form opinions BEFORE they answer?<br>  <br>  giving your OWN life a 'purpose' to live , something that shows you why YOU have made a difference here, you have mattered here, why your life was worth living, which we as humans ALL have the desire to do im afraid, is not hypocritical when believing that we are not here for any HIGHER purpose, a calling, a reason for being alive, <br>  <br>  we are alive so we give our lives reason<br>  its not the same at all as being alive FOR a reason<br>  <br>  you say theists are honest as if you admire that, well then you should not have any qualms or problems with atheists being so too|`|c995a3fd95fc91f6fb1993edc5606fb4aa	huh?

Even for a believer!!!<br>  What is a purpose without  product of purpose?<br>  How about we call it a reason, or even better you can call it the'' meaning of life''!<br>  Because without one or the other of those?, YOU don't have any excuse to exist either, now do you???<br>  Because ''god'' just don't cut it for a 'purpose to live''<br>  In fact all you really need ''god'' for?, the the never ending afterlife you all have planned for yourselves!<br>  I have my family, and my friends to enjoy everyday of my life! They are a great source of love, joy, and comfort to me!

There is no objective purpose to the universe.

I am a rational self-aware agent, and this is what I do. I give meaning to observations. I interpret events.

Unless the atheist can prove that they are a product of purpose."<br>  <br>  no it's not. if the atheist said they are a product of purpose, it would be circular logic. i make purpose, purpose makes me. it doesn't work. <br>  <br>  what we say is i have purpose because i create it, i find purpose in the real world, my purpose is what it is because of who i am, what i believe in. ex: if i am a scientist, my chosen purpose is to find a cure for cancer. my purpose does not create me. it may guide some of my choices in the future, but i am the creator in this. it's a one way street, there isn't even a roundabout, let alone circular logic.|`|I3yU4XvLaa	Your right in the end there is no purpose, it's a joke.

If you were to stop and think outside your little Christian mind for once you would be able to comprehend that the human mind is full of reason and logic and we don't need some "higher being" to tell us how to live our lives.  When you can truly let go of your slavery to religion you can truly be free.|`|eUEgi111aa	It's a fallacy if you're being a pedant, but to say 'I have purpose because I give myself purpose' is the same as them saying: 'No, I don't have a purpose, but I will make damn sure I set my own goals and make my life worthwhile'<br>  <br>  Do you understand it when put like that?|`|UDprs7hbaa	I don't think I need to have some great and important purpose.

Then this god allows the humans to multiply, then these sons of god come to earth and take any human woman and make a bunch of children....Then god says...Hey you nasty humans you. Then god brings the flood and kills everything because the humans are so nasty.....If god hadn't created a bunch of sons with human parts and no women the humans would not have got so nasty...Hence,,god is not very far sighted or god is a dunce. I choose the latter......|`|S9DRv12Aaa	I never said that there was meaning and purpose to life. All I am convinced of is that this is the only life I know for CERTAIN, and therefore I shall live it for whatever it may be worth. LIVING IS ITS OWN JUSTIFICATION, so where does the "wishful thinking" aspect of it that you accuse me of come in? Why should anyone of sound mind put non-existent and imaginary supernatural beings into life's equation? That is patently absurd.<br>  <br>  Human life doesn't have a meaning, per se. It does have a PATTERN, however, and the most "perfect" pattern is this: you are born, you are educated, you work, you marry, you have children, and you die. Inherent in the preceding statement is the imperfection of human life - deviations from the "perfect" pattern, such as being too impoverished to get a decent education and a decent job. There are millions of humans who exist within this "imperfect" pattern.<br>  <br>  Only a fool believes in impossible things like God, Heaven, Hell, and all other such nonsense and calls them "divine mysteries." The fool has no purpose other than to desperately cling to a child-Father relationship that they have never outgrown, because they actually are in fear of the very logical possibility that mortal death is the END, and that there is no "afterlife." You strike me as one of these fools. Sorry, but the truth hurts, and you'll have to learn how to get used to it.|`|rbxqgrh0aa	i think you are looking at 'purpose' the wrong way. God does not exist, there is no creator. Humans can do what they want as long is it is not against the law. Theists think that they have to serve a purpose because they believe that god created them. What a sad way to live in my opinion. Why devote your life to pure rubbish.|`|tQQ4aV9uaa	Umm, we simply decide for ourselves what the "purpose" of our lives will be.<br>  <br>  "purpose" as used here is a subjective evaluation, made by humans. There is no intrinsic dimension to the universe labeled "purpose".<br>  <br>  For example I might decide I am going to be a medical scientist, and cure all diseases.  That's a "purpose" assigned to myself, by me.  Then I work towards my self-given purpose, by studying at school, getting into the right university, studying the right courses, getting into a medical research facility, etc.<br>  <br>  Or I might decide to have no purpose, and just enjoy my life here while alive.|`|6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	I always answer "I have no 'universal' or 'predestined' purpose, but I have goals and aspirations".<br>  <br>  How's that?|`|7ylYxklsaa	Assigning one's self an existential purpose and pinning down legitimacy of an actual historical document are two different things. 'Purpose,' even in our heads, can be credible. If you set a purpose for yourself, even if it's an arbitrary, it then does become a true purpose because you make it real, and expect yourself to live up to it. Purpose is abstract and subject to interpretation. <br>  <br>  Just saying that God gave the world the Bible does not make it true. 
SM25WEnJaa	i'd say your bicurious. unless you actually have "love" feelings for your friend. then you'd be bi. i have had an experience exactly like this before, im surprised your coming out and admitting it tho. ahaha|`|IVy35SE2aa	Sounds like you are at an age where you are learning about your body<br>  and experimenting with new and different good feelings.  Nothing<br>  unusual or bad about that.  Most people have done things like that<br>  at sometime or other. The penis contains more  than a thousand nerve endings<br>  so it is made for feeling sensations. Many are too uptight to talk about it and some<br>  can't even admit it to their selves.  They feel guilty and think they<br>  have sinned so they clam up.<br>  A guy told me that if you go both ways, you have twice the chance at having a date Saturday night.|`|m9LNP93jaa	That is kind of odd but it sounds like you are bi to me. |`|AA10293793	you will like a lot of people. the question is: would you like to get into their pants?<br>  sounds like you're too young to be worried about this. could be a phase, could be confusion. could be you're gay, or even bi.<br>  don't stress it too much for now. see where life takes you.<br>  the big thing to remember is this: don't make any anouncements until you're sure, because you're likely to get a lot of hassle. and no matter what anyone tells you, there is nothing wrong with being gay.|`|6d6a921c5c0eccb75bc084215e975098aa	Ok. Way tooo graphic yuckers, your not the only one to have done things like this, but next time just tell us you've done sexual things with guys. This is called experimenting, now don't get me wrong a lot of people do this but if you liked it a lot, and you like girls but your not sexually attracted to them then you're gay which is tottaly fine.<br>  <br>  I think he's being truthful i've heard of things like this happening from my friends.|`|WmQlkCL9aa	I really doubt this is a truthful question.<br>  <br>  Because if it were then you would know by now that yesm you are gay/bi|`|BtKJQHQMaa	1--this sounds SO FAKE<br>  2--if it is real you are SO BI|`|k0CQXeTeaa	You might be, you might not be.

iMGgBH5jaa	Like any good republican... their only motivation is out of fear.. like a rattle snake, cornered.. that is the only time they will act.. and when they act they usually strike with malice and venom.. BUT the people of America chose not to succumb to fear... they decided that they would NO LONGER allow fear to guide them into the political, economic and social abyss... they faced up to their fears... and instead of voting from their blood, this time they voted from love, compassion, rationality, and a genuine desire for equality and respect. They are no longer afriad of the dark. They have the power to bring light back into their lives and cast away the fear that has darkened their great nation for the last 8 years... They are NO LONGER afraid of the DARK... They can now earn the respect of the rest of the world and finally move forward. YES THEY CAN!|`|3fa6f56441b907487541819a03872781aa	I agree that McCain and his campaign hoped for a brighter future; and I also agree that the Obama supporters feared the fact that they actually might have to work for a living as opposed to getting a free ride.

That's why I voted as I did. I don't know why everyone else voted for my candidate, but damn, I am glad he won.<br>  <br>  And if it matters, I do think we are in for a brighter future, if only for the fact that things can't really get worse than they are. I truly believe Bush is not a bad or evil man, but he and his policies have dragged the country I love through the mud, and I want something else. I think our goal should always be to make things better so that when we hand this world off to the young people who will lead some day, they don't get stuck with a crappy mess. I truly believe we owe that debt to the future, and also to each other. And that's why I invested my vote where I did.|`|dF5clN4daa	God's hand guides the heart of a king... <br>  <br>  don't think for one moment that Obama was elected because he was 'God's favorite'.

30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	Unlikely, in less educated regions where war is still devastating the population, like Iraq, Afghanistan, and parts of Africa religion is flourishing, so it's not the war it's the education that is the factor.  Through most of it's history Christianity restricted education to the clergy, this meant that the laity had no foundation to evaluate and analyze what they were being told and thus simply accepted it.  In an educated society people read for themselves, and compare what they're told with what they can learn for themselves, and contradictions need to be addressed if a source wishes to retain credibility.  In Europe the decline is mostly among Christian churches, since they are the ones who persist in trying to deny empirical evidence that contradicts their dogma, and the people are less responsive to that kind of authoritarianism.|`|641d79f1fb962fec1327d88ec4977c9daa	Having to witness the horrible things that take place in war.

No, not really..|`|MTi7r9l6aa	I'd be more confused than anything. I mean, why would Christianity be the right religion? What makes Christianity so special? Why does their god exist, and not any other equally-legitimate god? I'd be scratching my head until Jesus cast me to hell, then I'd ask Satan if I can be a staff member.|`|GHdscZ2Haa	And what will you tell YHWH when you discover that Jesus was a false messiah.   After all he failed to fulfill messianic prophecies.<br>  <br>  <br>  What will you tell Odin when you discover that you are doomed to the cold depths of Hel rather than the feast halls of Valhalla?<br>  <br>  What will you say to Osiris when you stand before him and do not know the answers written in the book of the dead?  Will you plead and beg not to have your soul torn apart?<br>  <br>  <br>  Pascal's Wager has everything to do with this.  You are assuming that either it is your religion or none.   Where there have been thousands of deities fervently worshiped over the ages.

I would explain that there was absolutely no reason for me to believe in him over other gods or no god. I'm pretty sure Jesus would forgive me. <br>  But of course none of this will happen cause it's a fairytale. Christianity along with other religions is already dieing out worldwide.

The desire for vengeance when an innocent person is harmed is natural. But our courts and our society should not function on a "gut" level.

Well, just try to know, what’s makes God as god, the Power, isn’t it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything and most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isn’t it? Isn’t it good? Ah? So, what I try to say here is, from my hard study and research effort with the help from god, I realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent and existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us and we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end and also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So we cannot get anything from nothing. & how could that be possible to be perfect in perfection always, ah…? No way has the perfection of god come first or the growth towards perfection. There is No End and there is No beginning and so the Ability is for the Love of Joy & ~ LOVE IS THE ABILITY ~ <br>  If you don’t still agree, then note this important point: - you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is good and Almighty. Simple logical prove (the evidence) for this concept. So, <br>  If you are humble, please... Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith and. Good in Bad & Bad in Good so the values are most important. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always & If you think, why so much trouble and pain in this world…? Then there is only one reason, without pain, No pleasure and without pleasure, no pain. So without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them in our development towards the perfection of God. So-so you use pain and pleasure instead of pain and pleasure use you. I mean the vision of your future should be clear & it have to pull you rather than you have to push so you must link a lot of pleasure in order to succeed in the Best job. When you feel strong enough links a lot of pleasure in your subconscious mind and your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & It is wonderful nature for us by the true God. And we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith… it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. &  If you think, even expert can be wrong then you have to make the fine research in all most everything so It is hard and some time, it is impossible to achieve so Why we need inappropriate action to find the owner of higher power? So, because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. & All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory so closely, Have a look at this world of wonders of yours and then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice and then Having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best. And most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now & try to know where you come from to have the great gift of understanding and then, have the faith to become the best winner in your life. & The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us and God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.<br>  Well, it is the time to make the great decision. <br>  Good luck. <br>  The power is focus with the great mindset <br>  If you find this usefu|`|AA10293793	depends on the circumstances. for instance, if the crime was against a child or someone who was more helpless than your average individual. if it was a repeat offense, or if it was done in a particularly nasty way. i would absolutely deal out the death penalty if any of these were the case.<br>  the only thing that does not depend on circumstances is that there should be no room for doubt. i know there is always the possibility of mistakes, but forensic science has come a long way, and so have many other aspects of criminology. in many cases it is possible to eliminate any doubt.|`|8RKwP3gpaa	I believe in the imprisonment of this person, but I don't believe in capital punishment.

iLs2wdiNaa	Well, there is such a thing as repentance, forgiveness by the Lord, and also faith. Nobody can ever understand the Lord's workings, unless it is desired by the Lord, he may reveal a part of them or maybe even nothing at all. We all live in the great mystery that is God, and if my understanding of God is correct he is INFINITE and therefore it is extremely hard for a mere human to grasp his workings. So how may an atheist understand? Through fervor, devotion, faith, repentance for his sins, and by placing his faith n the Lord. |`|uyn5d1dHaa	You allow the reader to assume Christians possess an understanding of God's nature; it seems obvious there's a great amount of arrogance contained in that statement. Who's to know the eternal mind of God? Is it not constantly said He lies outside our understanding, outside of our conceptions, and beyond our imaginations? How can Christians, even with books and prayers, possibly hope to know a creature to whom they allot so much mystery?<br>  <br>  The mind of God, regardless of His actual existence, seems unanimously "unknowable;" Christians sell it, atheists don't bite, assuming there's nothing to know; but, the fact remains. And if He's up there, how could He possibly have the right to judge somebody outside His realm? When was it ever possible, as it were, for the Queen of England to judge citizens of The People's Republic of China? Neither group can claim moral superiority over the other because of differences in culture - not to mention distance, natural resources, and age. If the Divine and Man inhabit two separate plains, I assert neither can claim dominion over the other. This would also work in the other direction, taking care of the Devil.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I consider myself and atheist because I've always been cognizant of the facts, particularly aware of truth's inherent reliability, it intricate connectedness, and absolute ease of flow. There is no fighting with the truth - it simply is, standing naked in the daylight. Christians fight far too hard to condone the dogma of their religion, fight far too hard to find verification for (not so much "in") their ancient texts. If the stories in Genesis of the Creation Week aren't twisted and contorted to match current scientific understanding, our modern technological advances are discounted out of hand.<br>  <br>  This latter point is worth exploring just a little farther. Our education systems are in disastrous conditions. Creationists, such as yourself, make personal missions of shoving Creationism down the throats of children so indoctrinated it's taken as insult when the dogma is challenged. It's saddening to realize how the evidence for evolution is so abundant and concrete as to be comparable to water's being two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen. No challenges spew from Christians on this formulation and yet evolution, despite this equality, is discounted out of hand.<br>  <br>  Nobody can know God - you're the only person arguing to the contrary. And (to play devil's advocate, neverminding the pun), if God's ways are truth, honesty, justice, equality, and understanding of the world He's "created," I would say atheists are closer to God than you seem. I'm sure that will upset you, but my atheism demands honesty from me. You and I don't agree on its importance.|`|AA12207673	Many have gone before you and asked these questions. In Proverbs it is written that a fool has said in his heart that there is no God. I don't know where you stand in your belief but I do understand habits can lead people astray unless we surrender to another person with better skills at handling life's category's.

How can we ever understand God? Assuming it/he/she does exist...there was once a french chemist that said that man would never know what those twinkling things in the night sky were. Today we know their exact chemical composition; most of it is hydrogen and helium. If something is unknown it does not mean it will always be unknown. Now, there is no shame in saying that I do not know until it can be proven as opposed to some theists who assume there is indeed a God and even assign him attributes. That is like assuming that stars were fireflies that got stuck in the sticky canopy of the sky.

Infinity is what exists outside of this. Finite life and time are both illusions. Our souls are infinite. It is not as though God has an obligation to save anyone. He does so from mercy. If he chose just one soul to save, it would be far more than anyone could expect.

And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.<br>  <br>  Rejection of Light Hardens Heart.--Pharaoh saw the mighty working of the Spirit of God; he saw the miracles which the Lord performed by His servant; but he refused obedience to God's command. The rebellious king had proudly inquired, "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? . . . [Ex. 5:2]." And as the judgments of God fell more and more heavily upon him, he persisted in stubborn resistance. By rejecting light from heaven, he became hard and unimpressible. The providence of God was revealing His power, and these manifestations, unacknowledged, were the means of hardening Pharaoh's heart against greater light. Those who exalt their own ideas above the plainly specified will of God, are saying as did Pharaoh, "Who is the Lord, that I should obey His voice?" Every rejection of light hardens the heart and darkens the understanding; and thus men find it more and more difficult to distinguish between right and wrong, and they become bolder in resisting the will of God.<br>  <br>  God Gave Pharaoh Into Hands of Self.--Every additional evidence of the power of God that the Egyptian monarch resisted, carried him on to a stronger and more persistent defiance of God. Thus the work went on, finite man warring against the expressed will of an infinite God. This case is a clear illustration of the sin against the Holy Ghost. "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." Gradually the Lord withdrew His Spirit. Removing His restraining power, He gave the king into the hands of the worst of all tyrants,--self.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bibleuniverse.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bibleuniverse.com/</a><br>  |`|JTD3M8Ziaa	Well, the god of the bible *is* a bloody-fisted genocidal psychopath...|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Fear is ultimately the most destructive motivator.|`|BU8GnAw0aa	Exactly!|`|HPn75mp8aa	Yeah, that's always struck me as being odd.<br>  <br>  Denying god is the only sin you can commit from which there is no forgiveness.

Christians find that Christianity validates their view of the world and experiences, as do atheists. In that sense atheism wouldn't need to offer anything beyond being the most enticing world view to be accepted; you are an atheist not because of any benefits or promises but because that is the world you see yourself living in. Christianity might be better, but you cannot follow something you believe to be a lie.|`|scc6dBMCaa	As others have said. Atheism in and of itself isn't something based on perks. Religions promise perks. Atheism is simply not believing in Gods and often times this accompanies but not always no belief in the supernatural at all. <br>  <br>  For me the side effect is a stronger sense of intellectual honesty. Religions have no evidence for their claims. And I am no more inclined to believe than some person down the street who wears a tin foil hate so the Gormo's from planet Zenon cannot shoot him with mind control rays.

Moving along, The universe was not made in 7 days, IMPOSSIBLE, SCIENCE SAYS THE CONTRARY & SCIENCE DOES NOT LIE. Next, Yes there is intelligent beings in the universe besides us, whoever thinks the contrary is a poor little brainwashed idiot. Next, There's no such thing as hell or heaven BUT there is one Spiritual Realm with different aspects!, it would be rather stupid to think there isn't a Spiritual Realm with all the supernatural things that happen in this world, i.e. ghosts (ive seen them trust me they exist), one thing that does not exist is death! Moving along, God is not a man or a woman, HONESTLY God CANNOT discern Good from Bad, God cannot judge, God cannot see nor hear nor demand anything from anyone, Why? Because God is the Universe. i.e. The Universe CREATED everything including us. Next, Don't you think is rather stupid to come to this earth to live by a book called the bible???? So "God" said "I'm going to create billions and billions of people and have them live by a book that I inspired"......LOL That's a ridiculous idea. "If they don't they will go to a fiery hell"! LOL SERIOUSLY PEOPLE CAN'T YOU SEE HOW CRAZY THIS IS???? If religion is "the way", WHY ON EARTH ARE THERE SO MANY RELIGIONS???? Hint : RELIGION IS MAN MADE, INSPIRED BY STUPIDITY AND IDIOTIC HUMAN BELIEFS, believe that! Conclusion : God does exist but not in the way most people think it does, God cannot discern anything. There is life after death, a Spiritual Existence is real and we go back and forth from it to here, to learn and grow spiritually. Heaven and hell are not real, just one spiritual realm with different aspects some being more pure than others.

Huh?  God has given each<br>  person in this final generation, just enough proverbial rope with which<br>  to hang themselves.

Don't swear in front of them, don't engage in acts of violence around them, but to set a good example when you're around them so that they can grow up to be productive members of society instead of exposing them to too much...bad stuff.|`|XkFwy2b2aa	Sound to me that God make good argument in favor Abortion.|`|tManvxfQaa	Mat 18:6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and [that] he were drowned in the depth of the sea <br>  <br>  <br>  You need to read it again|`|dmTVbpcWaa	Jesus told them all to “turn round and become like children,” that is, as modest, free from pretension or ambition as small children are by nature. They were not just to act like children by making an outward show of these qualities, but they were to put on these qualities, so as actually to have the same spirit that characterizes humble children. Small children have no thought of rank among themselves but view one another as equals. |`|MvZMA5BGaa	Very serious passage and a dire warning.<br>   It means this:<br>  people have a hard enough time resisting the urge to sin but warning to those that not only sin but encourage others on to do the same - God will deal with them severely.<br>  One big example of this are those who boast that God does not exist and then mock Him and gather around them as many people as possible to engage in the same practise.<br>  <br>  Matthew 18:6<br>  But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	No.  It doesn't say "be a bad example for children".  You said that, not the Bible. <br>  <br>  Jesus was speaking in terms of those that teach children things that will lead them to hell.  <br>  <br>  Every saved believer, is forgiven all sins past, present, and future, and that includes all mistakes in raising children, forgiven.  And that also includes all errors in teaching our children about the Bible, forgiven.   The verse is speaking to unbelievers, not believers.  And once a person becomes a believer, it no longer applies to them.  :)|`|JXfGHsF6aa	No, It means that there is a need of repentence and being born again.<br>  <br>  READ ALL of ....

If that happens, I don't have any interest in having anything to do with that god either, because of what he has caused to happen on this earth.

Complete in other ways too.<br>  <br>  I was in my mid-teens when I realised that faith was based upon nothing but itself, and religious beliefs were essentially no different to myths of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and other ancient cultures. Scientific ideas made it unnecessary for supernatural beings, and in fact the idea of them just complicated things beyond reason.<br>  <br>  I was a Catholic and had been very devout. As a teenager, I found the experience hard intellectually and emotionally. But I then  realised the freedom that escaping from faith gives to accept what is true (or the nearest we can get to it), and not believe in myth; I do enjoy mythology though.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	I'm about 50/50.  I am sufficiently persuaded by the evidence I have observed that there is no god as any religion has described, but I am not so presumptive as to say that no "higher power" can possibly exist.  <br>  <br>  In fact, to the extent that a "god" may be defined only as a level of consciousness that exceeds human limitations, then I believe it is only a matter of time before artificial intelligence achieves that status.|`|408d09404066a3f4b3514273ef2131cdaa	I like to call myself "nonreligious." I don't like to use the word "atheist" because it implies too much; people tend to make a lot of assumptions when you call yourself an atheist, and I disagree with atheists on a lot of questions.

However, rather than seeing lack of evidence as being inconclusive, I take the view that lack of evidence is evidence to the contrary.  I guess it depends on your personal philosophies of information theory.|`|6776aca5f3e214a39f2baaa61927b183aa	i don't know what i believe.  i really haven't given many religiouns a chance.  i grew up in a roman catholic family and went to church for the first 12 years of my life and i was baptized and everything.  but i had to go to religious school after my regular school for about 2 months and the teacher was crazy.  she was so religious and just overall mean.  she thought everything was a sin and that everyone was a bad person.  i knew i didn't want to be like her so i stopped going to church and haven't been in like 7 years.  on top of that i just don't believe in god.  i might be wrong but everything the bible says and what you hear at church is just crazy.  after history classes and science classes, i have learned that religion used to be a way to control people.  however im not bashing on christianity at all.  i think it is great that people go to church and have something like religion to support them and guide them.  i just don't believe it.<br>  <br>  i believe when we die, it's like what it was before we were born.  i think this universe came about by natural processes.  i think life is possible if given the right environment and enough time.  i don't think there is a god.  i might be wrong though.|`|XO6NQROmaa	Hi, Let me start by commending you, you must be a very wise person to ask this question... I think you are gonna find me interesting. lol I call myself a believer, I do not call myself a Christian though, because back in the history that term was a demeaning one, it meant 'little Christs,' in a mocking way. I try to  follow the teachings of the Bible though, except the sacrificial stuff in the Old Testament and the eye for eye, tooth for tooth stuff ;) I also try to celebrate the feasts, because Jesus was a Jew and He did. Also God commanded His people to celebrate the feasts throughout all their generations so He could bless them always!  So I call myself a Judeo-believer. A combination of Judaism and the acceptance of Christ in my life, along with the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (just one name for Him) and the Holy Spirit. This is an amazing life!

uenk90B9aa	Well, I do agree that you need to Google up gypsy--it's what I did for my pirate costume last year and it worked quite well in giving me ideas.<br>  <br>  Ironically, this year I'm being a gypsy too.  My tips:<br>  <br>  -Wear large hoop earrings<br>  -Long hair down and sort of raggedy<br>  -White shirt, preferably long sleeve with big poof sleeves.  If it's short sleeve, then poof sleeves are recommended all the same.<br>  -Your pink skirt should be fine, but usually I prefer if it's some darker color, like dark green, blue, or purple so it can contrast with the lighter, brighter sashes I use<br>  -Go to your local fabric store and check out the discount area.  Get some random 1 yard fabrics of various colors, preferably solid colors.  First decide whether you want to go bright or mellow and go from there.  However, if you don't want to go out, then look around your house for a bunch of scarves and tie those around your waist<br>  -Bangle bracelets<br>  -Use some fabric to wrap your head in sort of a headband<br>  -And yeah, lots of jewelry<br>  <br>  My gypsy costume is sort of a more conservative costume with lots of random fabric tied around my waist and a big long black traveling cloak that I use every Halloween.  Mainly because I hate showing any unnecessary skin, and also because it's usually quite chilly on Halloween night around here.<br>  <br>  These are pictures of part of my pirate costume last year.  The green and orange fabric, cloak, boots, and the head band idea is what I'm reusing this year.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w124/chelekat/Halloween04.png" rel="nofollow">http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w124/...</a><br>  <a href="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w124/chelekat/Halloween02.png" rel="nofollow">http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w124/...</a><br>  <br>  Have fun and Happy Halloween. xD|`|8cLR79mgaa	Traditional Gypsy wear is not what your looking for. Make it bright and flashy. Lots of layers. Peasant blouses from the thrift store and longer skirts. Wear at least three of them in contrasting colors. Fold the top one up into the belt and scarves around your waist. Lots of jewelery. Ethnic looking as possible. Materials with little mirrors sewn into them are great too. And, you must cover your hair! I always hated this detail!<br>  <br>    At your party plan to read palms. Have fun with it. Trace the lines and offer mysrerious advice!

PvgZUzHjaa	It's very hard to believe you are serious with this question.

He brought his wife to this world, a woman he had married on the other world. She is, essentially a goddess.<br>  In his present god-state, he rules our world. He has a body of flesh and bones. Since god and his wife are both exalted persons, they each possess physical bodies. In their exalted states as deities, they produce spirit children that grow and mature in the spiritual realm. The first spirit born was Jesus. Afterwards Lucifer was born along with the rest of us. So, Mormonism teaches that we all pre-existed in the spirit realm having been produced from the union of god and his goddess wife. Therefore, we all existed in spirit form before coming down down and entering the bodies of human babies that are being born on earth. During this ‘compression' into the infant state, the memories of their pre-existence is 'veiled.'<br>  God the father, who is called Elohim, was concerned for the future salvation of the people on earth. In the heavenly realm, the Father had a plan for the salvation of the world. Jesus endorsed the Father's plan. Lucifer did not. Lucifer became jealous and rebelled. In his rebellion he convinced a large portion of the spirits existing in heaven to side with him and oppose god. God being more powerful then they, cursed these rebellious spirits to become demons. They can never be born in human bodies. <br>  The remaining spirits sided with God. Since they chose the better way, when it comes time for them to live on earth, they have the privilege of being born in races and locations that are relative to their condition and choice made in the spirit realm.1<br>  In the Mormon plan of salvation there needed to be a savior: Jesus. But Jesus was a spirit in heaven. For him to be born on earth, Brigham Young the second prophet of the Mormon church said that instead of letting any other man do it, God the Father did it with Mary. He said that the birth of our savior was as natural as the birth of our parents. Essentially, what this means is that Brigham Young taught that god the father came down and had relations with Mary, his spirit daughter, to produce the body of Jesus. Though many Mormons will not entertain such incestuous thoughts about God and Mary, this is what Brigham Young taught and as far as we know, this has not been denied by the Mormon church.<br>  Nevertheless, Jesus was born, got married, and had children.2 He died on the cross and paid for sins -- but not on the cross only. According to Mormonism, the atonement of Christ was not only on the cross. It began in the Garden of Gethsemane before he went to the cross.<br>  In Mormonism, men and women have the potential of becoming gods. President Lorenzo Snow said, "As god once was, man is. As God is, man may become." In order to reach this exalted state of godhood, a person must first become a good Mormon, pay a full ten percent tithe to the Mormon church, follow various laws and ordinances of the church, and be found worthy. At this point, they receive a temple recommend whereupon, the Mormon is allowed to enter their sacred temples in order to go through set of secret rituals: baptism for the dead, celestial marriage, and various oaths of secrecy and commitment. Additionally, four secret handshakes are taught so the believing Mormon, upon entering the third level of Mormon heaven, can shake hands with god in a certain pattern. This celestial ritual is for the purpose of permitting entrance into the highest level of heaven.3 For those who achieve this highest of heavens, exaltation to godhood awaits them. Then, he or she, will be permitted to have his or her own planet and be the god of his own world and the Mormon system will be expanded to other planets.|`|w74qWx0raa	That's sad. They scared you in to picking a religion. Just better hope the Christian's are wrong unless you pick them cause then you'll go to hell no matter what you do. There a cool bunch <br>  <br>  You don't need a religion. Look around you. The earth is all you will see. Get some weights, go running, read books study nutrition and eat right. Just enjoy the life you have and don't anyone scare you with stories of hell or any of that. That's the point of hell. To scare you into believing .

I'm a Protestant Christian, but i'm not going to tell you to pick this one even though I believe with all my heart that Jesus is the Lord of all. You need to figure this out for yourself. I suggest Praying to the one true God and ask him to show you who he is, If he's Jesus or if he's not. Now don't expect? an answer the second you ask. I would research the different religions, and if you research them with the real want to find the truth, God will show you the truth.

If you decide that you don't want to believe in anything then that means there is no hell and there is no go to forgive you just have to forgive yourself. I myself don't believe in hell. Just gods and goddess's. If I live by the Pagan creed then I cant do any wrong. |`|AA11274044	You do not have to pick a religion to be saved or anything like that. You can stay spiritual, look at the world and try to find answers to the primal questions of life like who we are, where have we come from, where do we go after we die and what should be our mission in life. Always have a logical and analytical approach in getting answers to these questions and follow and believe that which will satisfy you most. Do not believe or disbelieve anything just because it is written in the scriptures or someone has said so be it any saint or prophet. It is all in the mind. If your mind is pure and happy all the time no one can condemn you to hell. Always stay happy and do good things and dive deep within you. Meditate. You will get all your answers and direction in life. |`|PeQA58maaa	Assalaam u alaikum dear , <br>  Well I suggest u to become a Muslim.As u said , its a pretty simple not very complicated and a true one.<br>  I guess Islam is the perfect religion for every1...<br>  Even u shud become a muslim if u want to.A Sunni Muslim.<br>  And u r totally right, All the Prophets including Jesus Christ ( P.B.U.H) Spread the same message of Islam.<br>  Yes , I totally agree that christians believe that Jesus Christ ( P.B.U.H ) is the God.Well I say...How come a HUMAN is a God?Isnt it??<br>  Jesus ( P.B.U.H ) never told that he was God.<br>  He submitted his Will to God, So obviuosly he was a muslim coz who so ever submits their will to God is a Muslim.as Muslims are those who submit their will to God?Right?<br>  And about Catholicism n mormons,,,I have no information about them...sry<br>  As I live in India , I know the so-called Gods of Hindus...There r MANY gods.....Each of different type....Its mythology is similar to Greeks ones....Like God of sun, god of water , god of sea n all...<br>  Buddhism?......I really dnt think that is a religion...( sorry if it sounded rude )<br>  <br>  Mustafa Muhammad ( S.A.W ) was a sunni dear, <br>  <br>  So Being a Muslim I give Da'wah to u to become one of us , Muslim<br>  We all ain't terrorist as people make us out to be...<br>  Wearing a Cap , Praying 5 times a day , Reciting Qur'an , respect elders , giving alms to poor ( Zakat ) , fasting for a month is what Islam teaches us.....Right?<br>  The Best religion of all.....<br>  Read Qur'an once and u will get to see how B'tiful it is....<br>  <br>  All the question u have regarding ur life , Answer is there in Qur'an....In Hadiths...<br>  Follow the teachings of all the Messengers , esp.that of our Beloved Prophet Muhammad ( S.A.W ) and believe me , U will never wish to convert to any other religion instead one day u will also give Da'wah to other ppl...InshAllah<br>  <br>  Allahafiz....Wenever u choose any religion inform us on here...<br>  Let Us know...|`|fsxFebCOaa	I might have one for you. It is a religion that gets knocked almost constantly and does have some imperfections, but what one doesn't?<br>  They believe God almighty is one living being. He created his son Jesus Christ, and THROUGH Jesus everything else was created. It is all stated in the bible, the OLDEST book ever to be printed, and to still  be in print. Many believe God has protected it to keep the truth alive. It was written by prophets inspired by His holy spirit, the power he uses to do anything and make his will happen. It is separate from Jesus and his father. God also created angels, as well as humans, to show him honor and worship him. He did all this out of love. He gave us this wonderful life to show us love. We were created perfect. You know the adam and eve story. But because of a rebellious angel, Satan, Adam and Eve sinned and spread sin throughout all mankind. So we begin to die and suffer from pain as a punishment. Our bodies WERE created to live forever, scientists have proven a body is self regenerating and would continue to heal itself indefinitely if not for old age. Old age comes from dying, because of sin. There is a hope for this to end, and perfection to be restored, and the earth turned back to the way it was in Eden, a paradise full of happy peaceful people. It is all in the bible, no matter what version you read. If you want a religion with answers to ANY question you have, and one with a positive outlook on the rest of your life, and want a reason to continue living, contact Jehovahs Witnesses. No joke. They have all the answers you are looking for and more. Any rumors you have heard about them are not true, except they do not celebrate holidays. But that is for a reason THEY can give you, if you take the time to talk to one.|`|jvaFz2VXaa	I think this is very much the wrong forum for this question.  I don't like to be critical, but I agree with Fool on a Hill- your remarks tend to mark you off as what he decried you as.<br>  <br>  I am a 'Mormon'- that is, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  I have searched church records for the neutral angels theory you put forth, and only found it in opinion articles that were refuted by leaders of my church.  People have weird opinions- it's part of life, and it's what makes us not sheep that weird, even stupid, opinions come up here and there- we just correct them where we can.<br>  <br>  I also agree with whoever said that we will all tell you to be a member or our religion, but that's something you can never really get away from.  I think you should be 'Mormon' because being Mormon makes me happy, I believe it to be genuinely true, I feel I have good spiritual evidence of it, and it makes me a better person.  I would like to give those gifts to you- but others would say that, while they were Mormon, they felt awful and hated it, so they left it.  See?  Differing perspectives.<br>  <br>  Here's a course I recommend without reservation- ask God.  Learn to pray somehow- but use your own words, talk to Him as He is there, and listen for His answers.  Ask Him to lead you to the truth.  I know where I think it is, but I won't hold it against you if you feel He tells you to be a Buddhist (though that might be odd, considering), Sunni Muslim, Catholic, or anything else.  He will answer you, though, if you ask sincerely.  Good luck, seek the truth, find happiness.  Peace|`|toPjIc8eaa	The God of all these religions basically ask you to do the same thing.

However, I do believe in the words of Christ and that he has told us the ways to get into Heaven and what Heaven is like.<br>  <br>  Whether you want to choose a religion or not is up to you, but do not get so lazy in your life that you follow a religion and not question. But know that whatever you question, God is still a good God.|`|uEjES9Q2aa	Well, in my opinion Shiite is a whole religion in itself; it isn't part of Islam, regardless of what other people tell you. If you want to become Muslim, become only that, and don't follow any sect because God looks at Muslims as Muslims and nothing else.<br>  <br>  Becoming a Muslim isn't an easy choice, especially during these days. Take your time in deciding your religion slowly. You'd need to understand that some traditions in some Muslim countries isn't part of Islam.<br>  <br>  By becoming a Muslim, God would remove all your previous sins, as you would be starting a new life. Like I said though, take your time slowly, and study Islam as best as you can, and even look into some uncommon books about Islam.<br>  <br>  Don't leave anything out and keep your mind open to everything. Take care, and God would chose for you what is best for you, even if it's Islam.|`|AA12346187	muslim  is  not simple  if you  look at all the  rules  you  must  follow  its  much  more  complicated than  christian.<br>  but I would  just  suggest  you  seek  God  read the  bible and  quran  if you like  but seek the  truth  of |Gods  love  for you.

Well, just try to know, what’s makes God as god, the Power, isn’t it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything and most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isn’t it? Isn’t it good? Ah? So, what I try to say here is, from my hard study and research effort with the help from god, I realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent and existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us and we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end and also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So we cannot get anything from nothing. & how could that be possible to be perfect in perfection always, ah…? No way has the perfection of god come first or the growth towards perfection. There is No End and there is No beginning and so the Ability is for the Love of Joy & ~ LOVE IS THE ABILITY ~ <br>  If you don’t still agree, then note this important point: - you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is good and Almighty. Simple logical prove (the evidence) for this concept. So, <br>  If you are humble, please... Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith and. Good in Bad & Bad in Good so the values are most important. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always & If you think, why so much trouble and pain in this world…? Then there is only one reason, without pain, No pleasure and without pleasure, no pain. So without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them in our development towards the perfection of God. So-so you use pain and pleasure instead of pain and pleasure use you. I mean the vision of your future should be clear & it have to pull you rather than you have to push so you must link a lot of pleasure in order to succeed in the Best job. When you feel strong enough links a lot of pleasure in your subconscious mind and your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & It is wonderful nature for us by the true God. And we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith… it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. &  If you think, even expert can be wrong then you have to make the fine research in all most everything so It is hard and some time, it is impossible to achieve so Why we need inappropriate action to find the owner of higher power? So, because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. & All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory so closely, Have a look at this world of wonders of yours and then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice and then Having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best. And most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now & try to know where you come from to have the great gift of understanding and then, have the faith to become the best winner in your life. & The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us and God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.<br>  Well, it is the time to make the great decision. <br>  Good luck. <br>  The power is focus with the great mindset <br>  If you find this useful|`|Jyxi74x0aa	He loves us because love is his nature; all love comes from him. <br>  He is honest because honesty is also his nature. :)|`|yLJaIASoaa	  it is part of  his  nature|`|DEpH7w4vaa	God is such a huge being and His mind and heart are so large.

He put his hand inside it and felt dampness, although the surface was dry.  He said:<br>  <br>  “O owner of the food, what is this?’<br>  <br>  The man said, ‘It was damaged by rain, O Messenger of God.’<br>  <br>  He said, ‘Why did you not put the rain-damaged food on top so that people could see it.  Whoever cheats us is not one of us.” (Saheeh Muslim)<br>  <br>  Muslim society is based on purity of feeling, love, sincerity towards every Muslim, and fulfillment of promises to every member of society.  Its members are endowed with piety, truthfulness, and faithfulness.  Cheating and deception are alien characters in contrast to the noble character of a true Muslim.  There is no room in it for swindlers, double crossers, tricksters, or traitors.<br>  <br>  Islam views cheating and deception as heinous sins, a source of shame to the one guilty of committing them, both in this world and the next. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/346/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/34...</a>|`|TYstsM7Yaa	You should be more specific in your question, umm it depends on what you are talking about.  <br>  <br>  Is it hypocritical that you will go to hell for not being religious but if religion is wrong there really is no hell then. that is sorta hypocritical|`|lB3feOAwaa	It's neither   We see what we want to see |`|ridu0Rtwaa	Research shows that the reason humans struggle with emotion to find equitable solutions is pinpointed the region of the brain called the insular cortex, or insula, which is also the seat of emotional reactions.<br>  <br>  The fact that the brain has such a robust response to unfairness shows that sensing unfairness is a basic evolved capacity. <br>  <br>  The emotional response to unfairness pushes people from extreme inequity and drives them to be fair. This observation shows our basic impulse to be fair isn't a complicated thing that we learn.<br>  <br>  It therefore fully illustrates that all humans have morals controlled by the brain and that Christians are entirely wrong to try and claim morals as their own!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>

9390fcfcbe0f7ddb8fcc0e7c0bd0d6c8aa	No one but you can know who you are in past lifetimes, so be cautious of anybody who claims they can tell you. Almost definitely people like that are either frauds or deluded, or both. You might find someone who can guide you into opening your mind and perceiving what's there about your past history, but beware of anyone who says yes you were this or no you weren't that. Only YOU have the truth about you.<br>  <br>  There are a couple of good books on the subject (and don't let the silly titles put you off): <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Guide-Past-Regression/dp/1592570658" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Gu...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Guide-Reincarnation/dp/0028638174" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Gu...</a><br>  <br>  Help is also available from <a href="http://www.childpastlives.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.childpastlives.org/</a><br>  <br>  The best way to explore your past history is to start a journal on the subject. In it, write your feelings in detail. Write down the things that feel familiar to you, no matter how odd or disconnected some of them may be. You might, for example, feel upset - or frightened - or happy - or ? - when you hear church bells, when you smell the scent of lavender, when you see a photograph or painting of a cathedral, when you hear the sound of horses on cobblestone.... Characters in history you are drawn to? Repulsed by? What you're most afraid of? What scared you as a kid? Think about how you were as a child, events that impressed you in some way, etc. Recurring dreams you had or still have? How you sense you died? All these tiny fragments of feelings are like jigsaw pieces to your past that, when you put them together, might form an outline of your previous life. Meditate, of course. Contemplate your feelings and write about this too. Suggest to yourself that you'll dream about your past life. Even dreams that seem to be about something else could hold a clue to your past.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest you also read books on reincarnation and involve yourself with people who know reincarnation is real. Some experiences you have could be extremely powerful and emotional, even painful, so, if you can, find a support group or a very good friend you can confide in.

That is the Law.|`|dNRcM3vVaa	Awesome!<br>  <br>  So I was wondering, and I've always wanted to ask.  One of the beliefs of Catholicism is that the Pope is infallible.  The Pope says that the act of homosexuality is a sin.  How do you reconcile that, personally?  I am not trying to provoke or anything, I was just raised Catholic and have since left the Church for a variety of reasons, and because I left at such a young age I never learned how that sort of thing works on a personal level.  :)  Please email me!!|`|xhr2juWGaa	Well I was Catholic for the majority of my life and I disagree with the policy.<br>  <br>  |`|e962833cd56a5c20dd31e15ec32307b9aa	I'm not Catholic, but I know several who are cool with the gays getting married.

By me, it says a lot more about the people saying those things than it says about God.  I don't have any particular problem in believing that God and all that exists in the cosmos is perfect the way it presently exists, and part of that perfection includes human beings.  |`|cXXJVz64aa	To some people he is because they created him that way.

Cain was jealous.<br>  God told Cain that if he gave excellently, then he would receive Gods approval also.<br>  <br>  Cain let the desire from jealousy rule him & he murdered his brother.<br>  <br>  <br>  McCain actually gave up an earlier release because others were POWs before he was. And McCain suffered physically because of this. They were upset with McCain for sacrificing his earlier release...<br>  <br>  And also during the POW torture of being tied behind the back, one jail overseer loosened the binds for McCain. So he didn't suffer as much pain. Later the jail overseer carved a cross in the ground with his foot for McCain. And McCain said, that they were just two Christians brothers together at that moment. (Something like that.) When McCain said this, it brought tears to my eyes.<br>  <br>  So? Obama sacrificed things too. But I haven't heard yet.<br>  McCain is a born again Christian, while Obama isn't yet a born again Christian.<br>  So that should tell you about who gave the better sacrifice.

We all have a choice in what we believe, Joshua 24:15 says Choose ye this day whom you will serve...as for me and my house we will serve the Lord. You just have to have an open heart and mind, but better to be hot or cold and not luke warm or unstable. If you even have a slight belief in God, I would just ask Him to open your eyes and if there is anything that is hindering you from believing the truth that he would remove it and open your eyes so you can see and know for sure for yourself.

First of all, bible is not a science book nor it is a history book.

It only shows that God made the universe.<br>  <br>  Then, open your heart not only your mind when you read bible. Our heart has its own mind that our mind doesn't understand it.

A lot of people feed through the Bibles' most intricate details for answers as if God just typed it up and sent it to stores a year or two ago. He didn't. It's been through the translation wringer and refers to things that were relevant then and no longer are. It's why plenty of churches embrace same-sex love rather than try to drive a wedge between these couples.<br>  <br>  So, do what you feel is right. And that can totally mean embracing your sexuality without abandoning God.|`|Ujo05WVYaa	hi!<br>  I'm a devoted Christian, and I love Jesus with all my heart, and it is God's plan for me to be a youth minister.<br>  Hun, being bi or gay is not a sin. It is a mistranslation in the Bible.<br>  The New Testament was written in Greek, and in that language there was no term for "homosexual". The word used in the original text (when correctly translated) means "pedophilia".<br>  The letters written in the New Testament were about problems going on at the time and stuff like that, and if you would research the time period back then, you would find that pedophilia WAS a problem.<br>  God made you bi.

Pray, read books on the subject of homosexuality being perfectly fine, watch the documentary For The Bible Tells Me So. <br>  <br>  Most importantly, just realize that you are normal. 10% of the people on this earth as well as members of thousands of species of of different animals and insects are gay.

I myself am also struggling with this and I haven't really done much to fight it, but I know I need to. You should check out this site. It's livehope.org. Sign up for the forums. It's a great way to talk to people going through the same thing. Hundreds of people. People through all different walks of it whether they're just starting the recovery process or they have recovered from it. Just know you're not alone. It does suck not being out, cause I'm not either and I wish I had someone physical, not just some random person on the comp to talk to about it. But it's a good place to start. They can help us in the right direction.<br>  <br>  Also, know that God says he knows every sin you've ever committed before you were born, and Jesus came to die for all you're sins. So no matter what, if you believe, don't buy in to this you're not going to heaven if you're gay/bi when you die. It's a lie.

If God doesn't accept the LGBT community, then why does it say that we are all created in the image of God and then why did He put us on the earth the way were are?

Good luck!|`|YFOpZ0haaa	Why do you like him? If you do GO FOR IT ask him out!|`|luCReaXcaa	There you go, thinking again, with no actions to show for it.  Yes, talk to him, get a conversation going with him, and ask him his sexual preferences and if he is bicurious, bisexual, or gay.  From this conversation you can allow yourself to let a bit of information loose on how you like him and would like it if he put his arms around you sometimes.  Stop shouting at him because it gives a bad impression about your personality; you may even apologize to him about your shouting. You don't mention your age nor his, so my guess is you are in the upper grades of high school.|`|3SbceHi3aa	Well making jokes about his possible sexuality is just gonna make him nervous about telling you anything.  You should just disclose to him that you are gay, that you'd appreciate it if he kept it to himself and you'd like to know if he'd be interested in going out sometime.|`|AA11747527	he could just be touchy feely.  a very friendly type of guy.  but even if he were "bi" like you say, the odds are that he is gay.  being gay is a lot more common then being bi.|`|i4Vt4YJ4aa	Why do you bother if he is bi or gay??..don't you have better things to concentrate on?|`|tECCaiWJaa	Hey, <br>  If there has been lots of signs that he is bi..........i'll have to go with you on that...he kinda sounds the type. But really there's no prob if he is. He's allowd 2 feel wat he likes....the only difference is if you have a problem with it yourself. If you don't, I think you should just talk to him about it face to face, instead of making all these jokes and comments about it. He may not feel free to tell you bout it because of all the comments, and he might think you'll take it the wrong way. Just be straight with him bout it, and be wit him all da way. <br>  Good luck<br>  =)|`|BltbPsZBaa	It really depends on the guy's personality. If he is close to you and if you think he won't mind being asked such a personal question, then go for it.<br>  <br>  However, it is better to leave your friend alone until he is ready to tell you himself. If he is bisexual, it will come out sooner or later, so be patient and let him take his time. <br>  <br>  If you put him on the spot and ask him like that, he will probably tell you the truth - and if he does turn out to be bisexual (and if he is not ready to tell anyone yet) he will feel extremely uncomfortable while telling you the truth. <br>  <br>  So, the best thing to do is to leave him alone, give him space to think about it, and let him tell you instead. After all, finding out that you are gay or bisexual is a very tough, anxious, and difficult time for people. Sometimes it is a huge relief. But most of the time it is very hard. So just be there for him when he needs you, and basically give him time.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and him!<br>  <br>  -DeathGuru.|`|tXMorxyDaa	well i wouldnt shout it out... i would just pull him a side, like you said... and say hey i want to ask you something, please dont be offended if its not true, but i was just wondering if you are in to guys or not. and if he says no, say okay i just wanted to know bcuz i see u put ur arms around guys, and if u were bi or gay, it wouldnt bother me, i just want to know... if we are good friends you should beable to tell me. sometimes people are embarressed, shy or nervous to tell others. a friend of mine is gay, we knew since like the 4th grade, and in 6th grade, she finally came out and told us... but we alreadfy knew, it was obvious she was a huge tom boy, never wore make up, she always kept her hair short, and in a hair tie, and she would always put her arm around you and hang on you, we just knew. but good luck, try not to be rude, dont spread it around if he is... this is probably a very sensitive subject for him... just keep your cool.

Wr09qsYMaa	That is normal. But the real question is when are the people being themselves. When supervised or not. We humans do not need to be supervised it is just that we have been conditioned to think so. Once that mentality is gone there is no need for supervision. Of course that mentality will never be gone and even if it is certain individuals are always going to need supervision. But all in all es you are absolutely correct. People behave differently when supervised.<br>  <br>  Without God you would *goof off huh? What does that say about you my friend? It says youshould check your morals. Those who need somebody watching to keep them in line are the real sick ones. The ones who do good deeds just to get into heaven arent really sincere. They are selfish and do not care about anyone but themselves. I believe that when I die I am going to rot (sorry for the truthful bluntness). But still I give money to the homeless, donate my old clothes, respect others, love everyone etc. I do this because of my love for humanity and I understand there is much suffering in this world. Remember when they would always ask "who stole the cookie from the cookie jar?"....it was you....you stole because noone was watching....bad bad boy<br>  <br>  <br>  "If i didn't believe in God, I would probably goof off with everyone else. Just being honest."<br>  <br>  I am not arguing. But I am stating that which ever side you are on you are wrong. It is not right for someone to be good just because someone or "God" is watching. they SHOULD be good all the time I am not saying that they are, but they SHOULD. These are the exact type of people the bible was designed for. Those that have to be controlled and maintained to prevent chaos. You would think we would have evolved past that by now.|`|xOBn4gF6aa	haha Indiana thing!! i use to live there..still go up there all the time!

If the world really functioned like that, the human race would die out as soon as our doors were closed and the neighbors weren't watching.|`|idmgvLfRaa	I get the impression from SOME believers that if they didn't think they had a god watching them then they'd be out murdering and raping.

I mean, if you do nice things when nobody watches, isn't that the true testament to your character?<br>  <br>  Think about it. If you're Christian and only do nice things because it means you're going to Heaven and because your god watches you, then how does that make you such a wonderful person? Compare that to someone who does nice things without divine supervision or the promise of Heaven. theists will donate to charity eventhough they think they'll only rot when they die (no afterlife).|`|Gsd4VD13aa	Honey, religion leads to murder and theft just as easily as atheism. Its YOU religious types that have caused most of the suffering in the world by using your religion to justify your bad behavior.<br>  <br>  So don't give me that bullshit. Go read history.

I think it's more a matter of just tensing up and trying to be sure to not accidentally make a mistake that will get you into trouble. Just being more vigilant about your own actions.<br>  <br>  Most decent people are not otherwise bad, they are just more relaxed when the authority figure isn't around.|`|NCRfZRopaa	People can behave either better or worse when someone is watching.

And to be honest, they aren't.  They're just being more careful when they know they're being observed.<br>  <br>  I worry more about the Christians who say that if they didn't believe God was watching them they'd go on a rape and murder rampage.|`|AA11043053	You're drawing too large a comparison with on-the-job behavior.<br>  <br>  On the job, people ARE watched ... and rewarded & punished. In life, there's no God to do the watching, so no one is being supernaturally watched.<br>  <br>  Consider also that Christians are over-represented among the prison populations, and Atheists are under-represented. That statistic should put nullify any benefit from believing God's going to judge you.|`|CBKjEvp5aa	Well of course I watch more closely when a cop is behind me because I have a lead foot. It's got nothing to do with religion at all, it's just by habit.

(so i guess i work best when the boss isnt around) as for the cops i obey speed limit i show no fear to cops (i guess thats why i have a few tickets here and there) i do speed f*ck why not and if there's a cop i dont lower my speed i tend to like the excitement of whats gonna happen to me if i speed it up a notch|`|LpyEAcjeaa	We work together because we must work together. Its rather obvious that a species that cannot work together for the greater good will be out competed by a species that can. <br>  <br>  People are the same way. The rules of morality that we invent are biological imperatives. I can choose to kill you if I wish, but I would then have to deal with a society that no longer trusts me to act decently. And indeed, I am no longer working for the benefit of the species. Altruism and empathy are functions that serve this goal.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, these days we are so disconnected from our roles in society, it is easy to act selfishly. We can rationalize being selfish because we don't have to look at the negative consequences. We have such a large infrastructure set up that we cannot easily see our unique role.|`|a5IodNYVaa	convincing myself that some genocidal creator is watching me, was very horrifying. and then I became smart. if god can see EVERYTHING, he must be a perv. who else could watch children getting raped for hours and days without doing anything?|`|kFpFU97zaa	You need to be supervised to be a good person? That's just sad. <br>  <br>  Secondly, it depends on the boss. If you're boss is a micromaneaging tyrant, then yes- of course you're going to make sure that when they walk by, you're doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing. But I've had bosses who were awesome, and I can assure you that people behaved exactly the same whether they were there or not... in fact, it was usually the bosses who started to goof off first.

Once in a great while people ask questions that are about facts and advice rather than just baiting each other.  It may only be about 10%, but if someone has a question, they should have resources.  I asked a question a while back about how other Pagans might go about cleansing a house of an oppressive feeling.  I got good, solid advice: everything to making sure the air filters and plumbing aren't posing a danger to recommendations of what herbs are good for cleansing and comfort.  Sometimes people get very important help.  I've seen several people seriously freaked because they think there's a demon on their chest in the night.  It's important that they learn about sleep paralysis so they can realize they're not in any danger.  And there's always people with questions like "Can someone explain Buddhism?

Most have time to work out and be social, as well.  However, when they hit the streets, they are completely on their own, especially if they have no friends or family to help them out.  It's hard to find a job if you're a convict, much less housing.  So, they return to the only life they know that worked for them in the past: crime.  In their past, crime supplied them with their basic needs and wants.  In most cases, it's a basic need to survive and be comfortable.|`|38852752ccd0ae855afeb5b23f504950aa	There are a few points to this I would like to say:<br>  1)A lot of people in prison have problems including mental health<br>  2)I think when they do go to prison they are not realizing that they are do wrong so they are realizing they need to be saved.I have noticed that because here where I live a lot of the crimes are dealt with mental illness yet they put the person in jail<br>  3)No,I don't think they do they might have meetings with church groups.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	That is your opinion and not the opinion of Christians.

That was 15 years ago and now he has a prison ministry that extends to the families of those incarcerated.

It's incredible to me that<br>  so many people think they need to jump onto either the religion bandwagon or the Science bandwagon - they don't need to choose one<br>  or the other at all.<br>  I know there is a group called "Creationists" who run about saying<br>  "the Bible states this Earth is about 6000 years old"; well, actually the Bible SAYS NO SUCH THING.  Quite the opposite, the Scriptures<br>  teach of three Earth ages; not a different Earth, not a different terrafirma, but only the AGE changed.  We are presently in the second of the Earth ages.  The third is what people normally refer<br>  to as the "eternity".<br>  <br>  This Earth is eons and eons in age; as a matter of fact, the great<br>  war that Satan caused when he rebelled wanting the throne and position of the Christ - called the Katabole in the Greek Manuscripts -<br>  that war happened eons BEFORE YOU READ OF ADAM AND EVE IN THE GARDEN.  People are not being taught the Scriptures: they<br>  are made to wear blinders to where they cannot see anything prior<br>  to about 6000 years ago, and so many critically important Biblical events happened BACK IN THE PRIOR EARTH AGE.  People squish<br>  and squash eons of time and events into a small 6000 year period,<br>  and it won't even fly in the English but in the Greek or the Hebrew, I<br>  guarantee you it won't fly.<br>  Peter speaks quite a bit in the Gospels about the prior Earth age, and<br>  that war, the Katabole, and the way that many responded to that war, is the reason we are here in the flesh today.  <br>  <br>  Biblical illiteracy runs rampant in this generation, just as the Scriptures<br>  predicted it would, but you would think the Churches would at least<br>  try to teach their congregation what the Bible actually says instead<br>  of building Million dollar museums erected to continue teaching the<br>  false junk about the Earth being that young.  I have a mammoth tooth<br>  here on my desk that goes back well over 50,000 years ago for Gods<br>  sake.<br>  I take my students on arch. digs and celebrate any find that comes<br>  from the Scientific community.  A true Christian who is literate in Gods Word, knows that there is no controversy between true Science and <br>  the truth of God's Word.|`|AA11528489	I fully agree. Indeed, the "conflict thesis" between religion and science only emerged in the 19th Century as scientists began to be accepted as professionals in their own right. Many religious people have been scientists: Faraday, Francis Bacon, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Buridan, Father Lemaitre (who proposed the Big Bang theory) were all deeply religious and even incorporated their religious beliefs into their desire for scientific truth. Religion has in fact often had a positive impact on science, and its 'negative' impact is exaggerated and skewed, since a lot of the times the reasons were far more nuanced than it just being religious opposition.|`|AA11937917	I fully agree.<br>  <br>  the only problems arise when one tries to impose dogma over science. Just as dogmatics of Galileo's time reacted negatively to his breakthroughs, today's dogmatics are fighting the same losing battle. Religion will endure, and hopefully continue to lose its dogmatic zealotry. <br>  |`|SeyaUqtmaa	I do.<br>  Most educated Christians I talk to do as well.<br>  Of course, there are things called THEORIES in science, and that can change how you fit the two together.

LUGCxeuNaa	The main reason they would want to date you is because of the opportunity to have sex. I'm not for or against losing one's virginity but it clearly isn't worth going into a relationship just because someone wants to have sex with you, well unless this is what both parties want. Also remember that not everyone that says they have sex actually does. Most of them may be lying. It doesn't exactly make those people bad people just because they want sex. They might be experimenting.<br>  <br>  Anyways it's your call. <br>  Safe sex is actually good for your health. You aren't a **** for having sex X amount of times. I wouldn't even call a person who has sex X amount of times a **** because it is a derogatory term used by ignorant and uneducated people.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  "the thing is if girls weren't so SLUTTY maybe the world would be different. ugh."<br>  <br>  Hahahah funny how I just said "**** is a derogatory term used by ignorant and uneducated people."<br>  Girls should have the right to have sex as often and as many times as they want. The media has linked women who have had sex many times as evil people. They always make it look like the girl who has sex as the bully or as the "bad guy," CLEARLY it has gotten to MANY people around the world.<br>  Women have the right to use their body in any way they want and they shouldn't be called a **** for it.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	i'm in college too and i know what you're talking about. people see college as the time to explore even more so than in hs. a lot of college freshman/sophomore are just breaking up with their hs gfs and don't want anything serious. don't worry about it. it's true some guys can't handle it but a guy that really likes you won't care. just don't lead them on|`|nVoz9g1daa	Well, do not feel bad, my friends and I are 14 and 15 and some of them have already had sex. Some of them have had it with two or three guys but I haven't. I am a virgin.  I do not want to lose my virginity at 14 i just want to be a kid.

The truth is those guys are only looking for an easy lay so even if you did sleep with them they probably wouldn't stick around long.<br>  <br>  No one is looking for a serious commitment the first two years of college so casual sex has become the norm. If you're looking for a long term thing than don't be pressured into something you're not ready for.<br>  <br>  But unless you're waiting until marriage, remember that you can't stay a virgin forever. So if you love a guy and he loves you and you've been dating for awhile go ahead, don't cling to the idea of virginity, cause that's really all it is.<br>  <br>  Your sexual status does not define who you are.|`|V09mJHI6aa	well first off most people are scared off form a virgin because they are scared that you will become too attached and to answer your other question sex became casual because people are less up tight and more open now a days. you'll find the right guy one day. and if i wasn't in a committed relationship with my gf i might help you become a none virgin but sorry i can't help you out.|`|1I9S7kduaa	I wish i was a virgin... keep yuour virginity because i wish that i could of kept my virginity for my soul mate and so many people are having casual sex because no one has morals but NEVER lose your viginity just 4 some guy KEEP IT you will be glad u did and one day you will find the perfect guy and it will just be perfect!!!|`|tuR7uui1aa	Im not that fussed that people are having sex but what gets me is that they are so freaked out when you say your not interested in it at that time.

The Catholic Church does not expect anyone to pretend anything.  All people are called to chastity.  Some are called to be chaste in marriage,  others chaste in celibacy.<br>  <br>  The early church allowed marriage of clergy,  but after the first few centuries it became disallowed.  This is not something that can never be changed.   The Pope could decide to allow Catholic clergy to marry,  but that is unlikely to happen.    In any case,  the Catholic Church teaches that people should commit genuinely to whatever life they choose.   If  a person chooses to be married,  then he or she  must restrict his or her sexual activity to the marital relationship. If one is not married,  then sexual activity of any sort is not a proper part of that person's life.<br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.<br>  Peace be with you.|`|AA12070800	Peter was married, since we know Jesus healed his mother-in-law.  Priscilla and Aquilla were named as apostles and were married.  The idea of celibacy came about much later in the church, in a time when women were still considered much inferior and in an attempt to keep men in power.|`|UmNiOF1Uaa	Oh I don't think they had to pretend.|`|DArAz67Caa	I'm sure they were well informed that lust is sin-|`|qEjTwo7vaa	During the time of Jesus, there was no such thing as dating. The social setting of the time is different from what we know today. If you are interested in someone, you go and ask the family for the girl's hand. No dating, no courtship or stuff like that. Even up to that time, women were still considered as being the husband's property, not mate.<br>  As some of the Apostles were married, Peter, for one, was married.|`|PwD3slrTaa	Dating was never practiced until about the 20th century.  It's a very unhealthy social convention, but 1 Timothy 3 tells you that it's the goal of SATAN to ban marriage, not the true church of Jesus Christ.
HD6McHinaa	Well sir that is a real big issue seeing most protestant folks still igorantly follow and obey the Catholic Church's doctrine concerning baptism.<br>  <br>  Many Protestant faiths do not realize the Roman Catholic Church changed the method of baptism as prescribed in the Bible. <br>  <br>  God said Hos 4:6  My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Please notice God said my people. He did not mention the heathern.<br>  <br>  They did this by removing the name of Jesus to be baptized in as found in Acts 2:38 to baptizing not in a singular name but in three titles of that one name as found in Matthew 28:19.  <br>  <br>  In 325 A. D.  according to the 2nd Edition of the New Catholic Encylopedia baptising in the name of the father, son, Holy Ghost was first accepted at the(Council of Nicea, 325A.D.).<br>  <br>  Also according to the 2nd Edition of the New Catholic Encyclopedia it tells us that baptism took place by immersion is evidenced by Paul’s presenting it as a “being buried with Christ”.  (Rom. 6:3-4)<br>  <br>  A few paragraphs down it says verbatum on the same page “With regard to the formula used for Baptism in the early Church, THERE IS DIFFICULLTY that although Mathew (28:19) speaks of the Trinitarian formula, which is now used, ...........<br>  <br>  the Acts of the Apostles (2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5) and Paul (1 Cor. 1:13; 6:11; Gal. 3:27; Rom 6:3) speak only of "<br>         <br>            "Baptism in the NAME OF JESUS"<br>  <br>  Futhermore on the very next page it says The validity of Baptism “in the name of Jesus” was still accepted in the age of scholasticism.<br>  <br>  It seems so strange to me that the Catholic Church and most Protestant Churches to day use one scripture for baptism while excluding the majoroity of scriptures that validate baptism is to be done in Jesus Name.<br>  <br>  Jesus said by two or three withness all things should be established.<br>  <br>  To establish a doctrine by only one scripture is contray to what Jesus told us.<br>  <br>  Sadly most of the great church reformers that founded different Protestant Churches by breaking away from the Roman Catholic Church protested most all of it's doctrines except for one. <br>  <br>  That was baptism in three titles "father, son, and Holy Ghost" in stead of Baptizing in only name wereby we must be saved....the Name of Jesus like the early church did.<br>  <br>  In fact in the bible no one was ever baptised any other way but in Jesus Name.<br>  <br>  And no one in the bible was ever baptised by saying the words over a convert in the name of the father, son, and Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  In the book of Acts Chapter 2 Verse 38 it says the following.....<br>  <br>  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be BAPTIZED every one of you in the NAME of JESUS CHRIST for the REMISSION of SIN, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  Then in Acts 4:12 it said, Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is "NONE OTHER NAME" under heaven given among men, ...........................................<br>  <br>         WHERE BY WE MUST BE SAVED. <br>  <br>  Please notice if the titles father, son, and Holy Spirit are names "Plural" ..........then baptism in Three Names would be contray to Acts 4:12 I  just quoted.<br>  <br>  Jesus told them, Mat 28:19  Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name "Singular" of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost..............................<br>  <br>  teaching them to observe ALL THINGS whatsoever I have COMMANDED you.<br>  <br>  Why did Peter and the other disiciples not baptise in the titles father, son and Holy Ghost? <br>  <br>  Could it be Peter baptised wrong?<br>  <br>  Rather I believe what Jesus told Peter after asking him who he thought Jesus was. <br>  <br>  Jesus told Peter..... Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. <br>  Mat 16:18  And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.<br>   <br>  Mat 16:19  And I will give unto thee the KEYS of the KINGDOM of HEAVEN: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.<br>  <br>  Peter knew Jesus was the only name we could be saved by...He was given this revelation of the name of Jesus.<br>  <br>  Jesus told them when they saw Him they saw the father.<br>  <br>  Jesus told them he came in His father's name<br>  <br>  I ask you this question did not the bible say in Col 3:17: <br>  <br>  And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus.......<br>  <br>  39 Years ago God gave me this revalation of Jesus Name and I could hardly wait to be rebaptised. <br>  <br>  Later I also received the baptizm of the Holy Ghost just like the folks in the bible did with the evidence of Speaking in tongues as the spirit of God gave me the utterance.<br>  <br>  For those of you who still belive baptism is not important consider the scripture <br>   1Pe 3:21  The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us......<br>  <br>  As well consider the great commission Jesus gave his disciples....<br>  <br>  Mat 28:19  Go ye therefore,|`|UHoyQr59aa	Jesus loves you! you should baptize so you can go to Heaven when you die!

He didn't say to repeat the titles. Name is singular, meaning only one name was intended. Acts 4:12 says there is no other name under heaven whereby we must be saved. Col. 3:17 tells us to do everything in the name of Jesus.<br>  <br>  Historical evidence suggests baptism in Jesus' name was universal in the first century. Using the titles didn't become universal until the 4th century.<br>  <br>  Therefore, in obedience to the command of Jesus and the example of the apostles, we baptize in Jesus' name.|`|AA10641825	.<br>  Matthew 28:19  <br>  Father, Son and his holy ghost.  <br>  <br>  In Acts 19:5  <br>  They discontinued the Father and holy ghost, and baptized simply on Jesus.

BLWxEdrMaa	Christians are admonished in a letter from Paul to Jude, I believe it was, to "keep searching and see if these things are true."  Christians aren't taught blind faith by their Bible.  I would say that since Paul himself was a scholar and Jesus spent a great deal of time studying in the Synagogues (and got to the point that he was asking questions the Rabbis who had studied all their lives were having trouble with), their Bible sets a precedent for careful individual study.  I know Paul used his knowledge of other religions and cultures to his advantage in his own preaching work.<br>  <br>  Muslims believe that Jesus was a prophet, as was Buddha.  Why would they have a problem with anyone in their religion studying other prophetic works?  As a matter of fact, Muslim people are usually so well-educated traditionally that during the Dark and Middle Ages, science and mathematics was kept alive only in the Middle East.  Greek scholars like Pathagorus would go to the Middle East or Egypt and then return with all sorts of 'new ideas' they read about there.  Then our society credited Greeks with a lot of the knowledge we have built our understandings of Math and Science on, even though it is older than their civilization by far, and was preserved and even improved upon by the people who later became the Middle Eastern Muslims we are so familiar with today.  Some of the finest Universities in the Ancient World were created and maintained by Muslim people, and that tradition is continuing today, with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and a few other countries there having a high concentration of extremely advanced Universities.  <br>  <br>  Reading a sin?  Nope, not for either of the groups you mentioned, no matter the subject matter.|`|QC7vlfPPaa	I don't believe it's blasphemy, but it's discouraged because most people are weak minded (in the eyes of religious leaders), I guess they fear the competition?<br>  <br>  "It is the mark of an educated mind,  <br>  to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it". ~Aristotle|`|buS9i5T4aa	No. The blasphemy is in criticizing a religion without reading or having any real knowledge about that religion.

Sometimes the bible has been hard for me to understand, so if you read a book by someone that has studied the bible more then you, it will help you to maybe start to understand the bible better. I don't feel like the Bible is the only book that we should read, but just make sure that whatever other books you read, it doesn't get you to stray from the Holy Bible.|`|5bkmSQ3Raa	No.  Whether you're a Christian, Jew, Muslim, Hindu or anything else, it's a very good idea to familiarize yourself with the viewpoints and beliefs of your fellow human beings.

w4qneMVraa	This concept is difficult for non-native speakers of English, because it's a weird little thing the language has.  <br>  <br>  You cannot say: "I know such a ferocious tiger eating 50 people per year..." because in that case "eating" implies a continual action.  More correct in this case would be "who eats."  The sentence put together would read: "I know such a ferocious tiger who eats 50 people per year..."  because you are then discussing the tiger's series of actions instead of a continual state of eating. <br>  <br>  Does this make sense?  I hope I was helpful.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	I don't know why. The actual sentence is a little clumsy but if, say ,the tiger is still alive and still eating 50 a year, then "eating" is correct.

n6Vmo9jwaa	Debbi Mysweetheart U know the answer urself !<br>  Muslims Parent wont accept that ! and will kick their kids outta their house !|`|5CPlAenfaa	Debbi, double standards exist in every society. To answer your question, yes I'll be VERY upset and VERY sad. The best I can do is to try and explain Islam to my daughter, and perhaps it could be something that I did wrong which turned her away from Islam. Sometimes, one's environment plays a huge role in a persons decision to own or disown something. It happens all the time. In either case, I could never disown or hate my daughter for leaving Islam. I will however, pray real hard for her. As a Muslim, I believe that only Islam is the true religion. If you're a Christian, then you may also feel that your religion is the only true religion. We follow what we believe is true, otherwise we wouldn't hold something so close to our heart if we didn't believe in it. <br>  Of course, I'm always happy to see someone converting to Islam, but so are people of other religions when they see someone embrasing their faith. Dear, it's not double standard- it's pride. I have a friend who embraced Islam a year back. Due to her financial circumstances, she's living with her parents. But just because she's Muslim, they treat her like dirt. They took away her bed, moved her to the basement, they won't let her eat at home, she has to keep her  laundry seperate, if she wants to pray she has to leave home. <br>  So if you didn't already realize it, Christian parents get really upset and disown their children too. <br>  I think if you want to address an issue, then be prepared to see it 360 degrees, because it exists in every religion. |`|lVvLw2BMaa	Salam<br>  <br>  i'de probebly talk her/him into the right path.<br>  i'll tell het why i want her to stay in Islam and why i think she shouldn't become a christian.<br>  but end of the day, they get to choose their own religion.<br>  i'll do my best to giude them and make sure that day will never come when they would want to leave Islam.<br>  <br>  peace.|`|O5Zz2CMGaa	That is really difficult to answer.<br>  <br>  I would never disown my child. Nor would i beat him. <br>  <br>  I would ask him why he decided to turn to Christianity. What went wrong? Why he does not have faith in Islam anymore?<br>  <br>  I would advice him to read the Qur'an. <br>  <br>  If he still does not listen, i would pray to Allah. I can never force anyone to believe in Religion, may it even be my own child.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, i would have to respect my child's decision, no matter what.<br>  <br>  Millie: You will disown your kids? Really. Does the Qur'an say to disown your kids?|`|I0CYUZbraa	-slap slap <br>  <br>  -kick kick <br>  <br>  -shake their head to try and put some sense into them. Lol<br>  <br>  Less slaps and kicks for the child converting to Christianity than Atheism because I believe that a belief in God is better than a belief in no God.|`|vKzGpEXZaa	I would wonder why they wanted to do it, since Christianity in many forms makes no sense to me. If they can prove to me that it makes sense to them, I'd have to accept it, but I wouldn't necessarily be happy.|`|u9sWMtSzaa	I mean lets be realistic here yes i would be very angry i would tell them to rethink themselves and make them study the quran more. if they feel christianity is still for them i would reject them.|`|4OCIoHNIaa	It better find itself another place to live, because I wouldn't accept it as my child anymore.|`|0QpCwRiMaa	there is the door.|`|uvi3Sv5jaa	Im not muslim but good question. I'd like to know the answer. |`|j03o7ObYaa	Christianity is a backward religion no heathen nation or any barbaric tribe have ever come up with the notation, that one can die for others sins.<br>  <br>  Christianity has too much flaws, it teaches the morality of sex, how to rape ones own sister as Absalom son of David did to his sister, then he raped his father's (David's) ten wives on the roof tops of Jerusalem, and countless other more profanities.<br>  <br>  George Bernard Shaw said "The Bible is the most dangerous book in the world, keep the Bible under lock and key, and do not let your children have access to it)<br>  <br>  After studying and conversing with Christians  for 18 years, I will not allow my children to follow a violent a X rated religion as depicted in the Bible. And if they did they are no longer my children.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be harsh but truth is truth|`|k74Vr1KKaa	Well if he's still a child as you said ,then he's not in a position to take such a big decision because he lacks knowledge and education,I would make him understands this. |`|K5nwQfnjaa	I would treat the decision with respect and acceptance like my family treated me when I converted to Islam.<br>  <br>  Treat people how you would like to be treated!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Above answer, premarital sex is a big sin to Christians|`|J36UpE9uaa	It would depend on the age of the child, if hes under 16 and not fully matured and understanding i would ask him why, and lead him on but then drop it, after all not until he full matures and gets through puberty, he wont understand Religion Fully.<br>  <br>  If i had a son over 16 and he told me he wanted to leave Islam to become a christian, i would be shocked, im sure anyone would if there son was changing religions, i would ask him why? listen to his explanation, and then i would make sure he was a good christian.<br>  <br>  My son cant use the excuse "you know nothing about it" i studied christianity for a whole 2 years :) <br>  <br>  I must say, i would be pretty upset though. and of course, would always be trying to get him to convert back =]<br>  <br>  <br>  Beating, kicking him out of the house is out of the question. i would never do that.<br>  <br>  especially not kick him out of the house, out on the streets, anything can happen, things that are worse than changing to christianity|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	We give our children life, nurture them and raise them in our ways but then we have to set them free. The life was a gift from us to them and it has to be given unconditionally. Your child cannot be expected to live your life. They will form their own opinions and morals based on their life's experiences. It would be nice to think that they will follow in our footsteps as we each of us believe we live the right way but the decision ultimately has the be the childs. If my daughter started showing signs of being drawn to any religion whilst young I would steer her away from it, if she did it as an adult I would wonder what holes in her life she is trying to fill.|`|6LBJgACSaa	Even though I would be really really upset. I could never hate my own flesh and blood there's no doubt about that.I would just make Du'a for them all the time.And I'll show them this video.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=aIGT3qCFxuE" rel="nofollow">http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=aIGT3qCFxu...</a><br>  <br>  Anyone that says disown, no offense but that's just sick. Not only is it sick but you will defiantly be accounted for that on Judgment day, may Allah guide us. Ameen.<br>  <br>  Not really. I often wonder about their family too and how they're handling it.|`|CQz8dMzFaa	I dont think that would happen, but if it did, I would talk to them about it for sure, and see what made them make the decision, Christians are acknowledged in the Quran, and we believe that they will also go to heaven(provided they arent sinners). The two religions are very similar, so I dont really have much against Christianity(other than the fact that premarital sex isnt condemned, or is it? Correct me if I'm wrong). <br>  Personally, seeing what the world is becoming, I'd be glad if my kids followed ANY religion at all.<br>  <br>  However, what makes you think its not 'the other way around'? There are lots of Christians who would be horrified if their kids converted to Islam.|`|2Ue9KeKUaa	I would be soooo upset if that ever happened, God forbid. To be honest, I'd be disappointed in myself more than my child, because i must have gone wrong somewhere for them to feel distant from Islam.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't disown them, never. I would question why, I would encourage them to read the Quran and pray so that they get a better understanding etc. And I would just pray hard that Allah guides them to the right path. If they are set on their decision and they have thought about it properly, then i would have no choice but to except it. My respect and love for them wouldn't be less, I would be very upset though.|`|FsYUBf6faa	hmmm well i'm 14 so i'm not exactly a parent.

Thereafter, if despite my efforts they still choose to go Christian, I will let them be ("no compulsion in religion") and simply leave it to Allah knowing full well I tried my best. Surely, later on as they learn more on and become exposed to the many fallacies of Christian doctrine, they would ultimately end up coming back to the essential truth that is Islam.

The lady truly does care about u and even though u say u will never change your religion she and all other witnesses want u to learn about wat we believe. if she keeps leaving the magazines and u read them you will probably pick up on something or see something that catches your attention and u may say this is so true or see something that u didnt know was true and want to learn more about what we believe. I noticed though that you never asked her to stop leaving the magazines remember we cant force them on you. but we really want you to read them because theres so much u can learn & knowing that your a religious person you may be willing to learn anything about god. so please keep accepting the magazines & read them-- but if ur jst not reading them and or throwing them away tell her u feel she shouldnt leave them anymore. hope i helped-- by the way im 17 and everyone is different she could be leaving the magazines at ur door still becuz of a whole different reason so to truly find out you will have to ask her. theres no harm in that shell tell u.|`|U4nC3YK1aa	I've had a lot of dealings and personal experience with JW's.

rGEZup0Zaa	In Medieval Europe, Jews were often the ones who lent money to the aristocracy, because of Christian rules against usury. This led to the association between Jews and finance. Since Jews were exempt from usury laws, many Christians developed feelings of resentment against them for the profit they made on loans to nobles and merchants, while at the same time needing their services to remain solvent. They didn't like being obligated to "Christ killers", and so negative stereotypes developed.|`|IzUh3eSHaa	Oh, that actually dates back a few hundred years.

This was usually from people who resented having to pay, but refused to admit that they needed the service they were paying for.  If a Jew was the banker or middleman, then it was easy for a bigoted person to blame the Jew. <br>  <br>  Jews have had a hard time of it, needless to say.

My Question is that during my study and now I am working in a pizza store as a delivery person which is owned by a 'Qadiani', and he is selling pork pizza. Can I work in his store because most of the pizza orders are pork pizza?<br>  <br>  <br>  Answer:<br>  <br>  Praise be to Allaah.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible for you to do work which involves carrying pork and delivering it to the people who are going to eat it. Because by doing so you are taking part and cooperating in sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<br>  "Help you one another in al-birr and al-taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression…" [al-Maa’idah 5:2]<br>  We ask Allaah to help you find acceptable work and a halaal income, for He is the All-Hearing Who answers prayers. <br>  <br>  "… And whoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).

Chicken, beef, salad etc are generally considered as Halal, if the store is operated by Christians or Jews, or the store is in US. But things like pork, beer, wine etc are Haram. So dealing with those, making them, serving them etc are Haram as well. <br>  <br>  You have to look for a job which doesn't involve dealing with Haram things. If you can't find a better job and you are in need, try your best not to deal with pork. You may help in making chicken, you may clean stuff, you may cut salad which are Insha-allah Halal. Allah helps him who seeks help from Allah. So pray to Him. <br>  <br>  If you still find yourself dealing with pork, try to estimate the portion of your work which involved pork. Let's say, you worked 8 hours a day, and you had to do pork for 1 hour, then atleast 1/8 of your salary is Haram. You have to get rid of that portion later when you are in better financial condition.<br>  <br>  Try looking in islamqa.com and Islamonline.net.|`|20a2becc5949bcaed73411cff4b0b0f0aa	If you do not accept Jesus as Lord and Savior then you are commiting the worst sin of all.

AA10553382	Because when you trying to control situations, like a fight at home, and all you do is mess things up.  You are going against God's will for man, to realize that God is the master of all things and he is the one that ultimate control over all things on this planet earth, like global warming, the weather, hurricane season, personal relationships, the human body functions, and so forth.

Moreover, it often has zero effects - people will do what they want, situations will roll out as a combination of millions of variables that are beyond our control.<br>  All we can do is act wisely on what we CAN truly influence, and leave the rest on the general order of the universe... and always hope for the best.<br>  <br>  :)|`|AA10608381	Try to emit peace, love, joy and happiness from your inner being, forget trying to control what you think is out of control when it may only be within yourself that perceives something to be out of control. All have lessons in life to learn and control is out of proportion to GOD'S will. Trying to overpower others and make them do what you want is like a dictator. GOD is the dictator of love and decision making for all. If we as humans don't listen and go outside of the realm of HIS laws which bring us contentment, we shall lose inner peace and it shall forevermore be detrimental to life.Not all things are wrong as some believe them to be. It seems as though looking through rose colored glasses is only a personal perception and concept to the one that is wearing them.......|`|5640d6b33259d7555199e00894b4c6aeaa	The minute you think you can control a situation your inner peace is destroyed, because the only thing you can control is your response to what is going on.|`|6420ae324368ce78816c15a606a85c15aa	Whenever a person tries to control situations that are out of that person's control it becomes a detriment to their inner peace.|`|AA10247918	The words "trying" and "control" are ego-blocks.  Ego desires only to keep its hold on you and your perception of the world.  <br>    What happens when we try to remember something?  The more we try, the harder it is to remember, but when we let it go, at some point, what we wanted to recall suddenly appears.  <br>     This is because there is no effort in mind.  By trying, you are shutting off your reception of inner peace.  <br>     It is not so that you have situations out of your control, for everything that you see occuring, whether with you or the world at large, is asked for at some level.  Certainly not consciously, but deep within, we all ask for this separation from the truth of who/what we really are.  <br>     You are created of peace.  It is the truth of you.  Only focus your power there, (and now is always the point of power); it is always here for you, because it IS you.  Nothing is out of your control, for there is nothing you need to control.<br>     Say this: "Let this pass from me; let it pass to my understanding that it never was."|`|AA10375363	out of our control??<br>  GOD GRANT ME THE SERENITY TO ACCEPT THE THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE(other people the goverment so on and so on)<br>  THE COURAGE TO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN( myself) AND THE WISDOM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!!!

AA11114869	Morality is a human social construct rooted in our basal drive to seek out those things that would please us whilst simultaneously avoiding those things that would displease us; in other words,... morality is rooted in self-preservation.<br>  <br>  In this, - the idea of theft, rape, murder, etc..., may seem to us as morally 'wrong', but it only seems this way because our natural desire to pursue that which would 'please' us is overridden by our desire to avoid 'displeasure', - the displeasure being that which our society besets upon when we pursue those pleasure-seeking 'desires' which our society has deemed detrimental to the survival of the group as a whole;... a typical 'herd' type of self-preservation.<br>  <br>  Morality (and all of the phenomena associated with it) is not fixed; it is mutable. <br>  <br>  One man's right is another man's wrong...<br>  One man's pleasure is another man's pain...<br>  One man's good is another man's evil...<br>  <br>  ...and one man's God becomes another man's Devil,...<br>  ... when the Devil's name is "Master"...<br>  -|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Research shows that the reason humans struggle with emotion to find equitable solutions is pinpointed the region of the brain called the insular cortex, or insula, which is also the seat of emotional reactions.<br>  <br>  The fact that the brain has such a robust response to unfairness shows that sensing unfairness is a basic evolved capacity. <br>  <br>  The emotional response to unfairness pushes people from extreme inequity and drives them to be fair. This observation shows our basic impulse to be fair isn't a complicated thing that we learn.<br>  <br>  It therefore fully illustrates that all humans have morals controlled by the brain and that Christians are entirely wrong to try and claim morals as their own!!!!|`|VmGcNErkaa	I donno I failed Moral Class...

The social rules we have to make living with other people harmonious and fairly secure.<br>  <br>  E.g. the simple social rule, do not murder. Obviously we don't want to be murdered ourselves, so the social agreement (=morality) is that no-one in society commits murder.<br>  <br>  Most other moral prohibitions are also rules which make human society harmonious and reduce conflict and acrimony.|`|c58e77e1f1e2a9a07952df86cdc7c15faa	It is a very basic structure of how we learn to think before we act.<br>  <br>  Based on past actions, observed behavior, and cultural norms, we map out a right/wrong, pleasure/pain, happiness/sadness grid. <br>  <br>  This is not absolute and is based on the society we live in. <br>  <br>  We know that our actions have consequences. <br>  <br>  We also know that there are individuals who would go outside the norms of society, so, collectively we have enacted a system of laws.<br>  <br>  Those who claim that God gives us our morality need only to see the tyranny of theocratic rule to know that scriptures are used to pervert morality to gain power over the masses.|`|fLdv5pXLaa	It is different in different countries<br>  so it is a man made concept

The books to which you refer have a title, which is way too long (something like 150 words long), but is commonly published under the title "Lost Books of the Bible", which is a bit of a misnomer because they have never been lost and were never in the Bible.

Some of the "you have heard"s are from the Lost Books.

It's all a matter of what you believe in HELL or HEAVEN is NOT REAL(in my opinoin- but to each is own) But you are right the whole damation thing proves that the whole myth has some flaws. If he loves everyone why punish them. It's Crazy... And If he truly loved us all he would not make our lives so hard or punish us in live and in death. I think its insane. If I believe the sky is purple hard enough and i am taught its purple and go to Churches about it i will REALLY think the sky is purple.. although its clearly not. Again Believe what you want.

God is forgiving and loving, just like any parent.  Hell is where people go who reject God, refuse to admit that their behavior has offended Him and refuse to change sinful behavior.  If you fail repeatedly to follow your earthly father's rules, are rude, rebellious and refuse to mend your ways, you may find yourself no longer welcomed in your fathers house.  Chances are you will then run with a like crowd of people and your life will not be a happy one.  Hell is the domain of Satan, a fallen angel.

We have the chance on earth to change our "ways" if you have heard the Gospel once the you are accountable for yourself. Hell is not a punishment for sins, we are forgiven for our sins already. If you're sent to hell its because you chose not to accept God and try and turn your life around. The "punishment" for your sins is here on Earth. When you lie and you're caught you pay the consequences, you get punished. When you murder you go to jail, you get punished. Think of it this way the judge will give a drug addict so many chances to get him/her self together after the last straw they're sent to Jail.

Consider this ...<br>  <br>  Religious people pray to fence poles and cheese sandwiches.<br>  <br>  People say they talk to aliens, people say they talk to God. The first lot are called nutters, the second lot are called religious. There's a lot of money to be made out of religion and it has become a well rehearsed play over time. Religious people also pray (talk) to fence poles and cheese sandwiches.<br>  <br>  Christians are below average intelligence and tend to be very gullible, that's why when a fence pole or a cheese sandwich has an imprint that looks like a religious face, such as God or Our Lady, millions will flock to the spot and worship. It's also known as sheep to the slaughter syndrome.<br>  <br>  All religions are just fantasy or mythology or cults, call it whatever you wish. The main religions also have magic tricks which are called miracles in Christianity.<br>  <br>  Just watch what happens when a magic trick occurs, for example, the fence pole or cheese sandwich image starts to weep. Just watch how the flock of followers behave. People find it hard to accept reality so escape into fantasy and that’s what religion satisfies.

You solved it all, Thanks|`|M1HD5yREaa	This is an article that I wrote for a writer's website last year:<br>  <br>  On the co-existence of Darwinism and God (i.e. Creationism), upon scrutiny we can presume that both can be taught/believed by Atheists and those of the Christian faith.  We can address the objections on both sides of this issue in order to formulate this hypothesis.<br>  <br>   The major obstacle for those who reject the notion of a Creator, or God would be two-fold: Firstly, a complete lack of scientific evidence; secondly, Biblical literalism.<br>  <br>   In regards to a systematic and methodical explanation of deity, it would appear that one is not possible.  The atheist or agnostic would argue that there could be no divine entity or creative-act of said God because there is no attainable scientific evidence. However, if one is to be completely objective, one must acknowledge that there are things as of yet to be discovered.   In other words, we cannot say that there is no life on other planets because we have yet to investigate all other planets.   Mars is a perfect example.  Modern science has indicated that it once housed life of some sort.  However, this was not the original belief.   The same comparison applies to Pluto, no longer considered a true planet, but now defined by scientists as a “dwarf planet”.   As new information and modern technical advances are constantly contributing to new discoveries, theories and presumptions are subject to change.   As all knowledge is as of yet to be revealed, one cannot discount the notion of a Creator-God entirely, particularly when there is so much order in the Universe.  For the believer, this order discounts the “accident” of creation.   Furthermore, if there were indeed a design, it would necessitate the existence of a designer.  In fact, science suggests that there is in fact a Creative Energy at work in the universe.  In Sacred Geometry, mathematical ratios, harmonics and proportion are found in light, music and cosmology.  These same patterns are thought to be religious symbols, and are found in everything from snowflakes to the hexagonal cells that honeybees construct in their hives.  God is seen as the ultimate Mathematician.<br>   <br>   In Biblical literalism, Genesis’ creation story is historical fact, and the science-minded individual feels obligated to reject this entirely.  While evolution teaches that man slowly evolved over millions of years, the antiquated Old Testament tale speaks of instantaneous creation of the first man, and the woman actually fashioned by Jehovah from one of his ribs.  The story places the first two individuals in the idyllic Garden of Eden, where a talking serpent tempts them to partake of forbidden fruit.  After disobeying God, their paradise is spoiled, and the two become separated from their creator.  Taken literally, the story of Adam and Eve contradicts Darwinism.  However, if taken as divinely inspired Jewish religious-myth, the two can be reconciled.<br>    <br>    As poetry, the Genesis account attempts to explain that man is a created being, but his relationship with his “Higher-Power” becomes corrupted by disobedience, pride and ego, ergo sin.  There are two different ways to translate this.  On the one hand, humans actually have a literal God to fear and worship.  Alternatively, the story could be conveying a way to raise consciousness and progress beyond our primal ways.  The scientist theorizes that man and ape evolved from a common ancestor, but must confess that our animal intelligence is far above other primates, and that our consciousness continues to evolve.  While the Christian Fundamentalist completely discounts the man-ape evolution aspect, he must accept what science has confirmed:   man’s thumbprints were here centuries before the Jewish tribes of the Old Testament existed.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	Throw out the bible, and you throw out Christianity, mate.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Because there are mountains of evidence for evolution, none against it, and ZERO evidence of any gods.
b0qKOoBRaa	Hahahha true.  <br>  <br>  But I am still a Christian.  Who ever said that faith proves anything, anyways??  If God cared to "prove" himself in a concrete manner, we wouldn't need faith.

This is clearly the case, even though the Prophet ordered simplicity in the houses of Allah, the mosques have become more and more fantastic, with golden domes, marbled floors, lavish carpets and chandeliers. <br>  <br>  Disappearance of trustworthiness, so much so that one would only be able to say: "I know a trustworthy person in such-and-such town." <br>  <br>  The increase in killing, so that the one who kills does not know why he killed, and the one killed does not know why he was killed. I was recently sent an article from the Washington Post about the rise of gang warfare. Part of the initiation ceremony was for a new gang member(some times as young as eleven) to shoot someone. The second highest cause of death from fifteen to thirty five in the US are gun related. The massacre of civilians in the Vietnam War by American troops who had little idea why they were there, and the increase of such conflicts, is further illustration of the fulfillment of this prophecy. As are the rise of insane mass murders, of children killing children, such as Jamie Bulger. <br>  <br>  The increase of the use of riba (usury/interest) so that no one will able to escape being tainted by it. This clearly the state of the world economy today. <br>  <br>  The enemies of the Muslims dividing the Muslim's wealth and lands between them, the Muslims abandoning jihad, and concerning themselves only with the worldly matters. We have already mentioned this. <br>  <br>  The increase of literacy. <br>  <br>  The decrease of religious knowledge due to the disappearance of scholars. <br>  <br>  The increase of musical instruments, and the Muslims making it lawful even though the Prophet has forbidden them. <br>  <br>  The increase of sexual promiscuity, and new diseases that people had not herd of before spreading amongst them as a consequence of that. This is clear, with the arrival of AIDS, and other previously unheard of viruses. <br>  <br>  Appearance of Dajjals (liars), each claiming to be a Messenger of Allah, while Muhammad is the last messenger. There are numerous examples of this, starting with Musailima, who arose in the time of the Prophet, just before his death, to more modern liars such as Elija Muhammad, founder of the Black American racist movement "The Nation of Islam", and India's pretender Gulam Ahmed of Qadian. <br>  <br>  Nakedness of women while still being dressed. <br>  <br>  The drinking of wine becoming common, and the Muslims making it lawful by calling it another name. <br>  <br>  Shouting in the mosques. <br>  <br>  The worst and most ignorant will become leaders and they will be oppressors. <br>  <br>  A man will obey his wife and disobey his mother, and treat his friends kindly and shun his father. <br>  <br>  Men will wear silk and gold, and the making of it lawful by the Muslims even though the Prophet had forbidden it for the men of his 'Ummah (nation). <br>  <br>  People will abandon the religion for a small worldly gain, and keeping to the religion will be like holding two hot coals. <br>  <br>  So these are just some of the numerous prophecies of Muhammad, that have clearly come true, and some have been fulfilled in this age in which we live, all adding weight to the evidence in favour of his claim. <br>  <br>  The Qur'an also provides accurate knowledge of the past. This is also information which Muhammad was unable to receive except from Allah. Some examples of this are: <br>  <br>  The Qur'an mentions about the ark of Noah: "The Ark came to rest upon Mount Judi" (11:44). Recent archeological research has discovered a boat shaped object with exactly the same dimensions as those of the Ark on Mount Judi. The Bible claims that the Ark came to rest twenty miles away on the Mountains of Ararat. This is not possible, since these mountains are a recent geological formation, and did not exist at the time of Noah. The Qur'an also refers to the flood as a localised event, destroying only Noah's people. The dates and time offered by the Bible for the flood, and its claim that it was a world wide cataclysm, has been proven false by all archeological evidence. <br>  <br>  The Qur'an describes the ruler of Egypt being addressed as "King" in the time of Joseph, whilst Moses addresses the ruler as "Pharaoh". This is a small but telling accuracy, for in the time of Joseph the rulers were from the Hykos Dynasty, and were Semites. They did not refer to themselves as "Pharaohs". The term was used by the native Egyptian dynasties that supplanted the Hykos, in the time of Moses. The Bible again proves inaccurate on this point referring to both as "Pharaoh". The Qur'an also correctly describes aspects of the ancient Egyptian religion, in particular the worship of Pharaoh as a god. <br>  <br>  The Qur'an refers to the early followers of Jesus as "Nazarenes". This is historically accurate. The word "Christian" was actually a nick name used by the Romans sometime after Jesus - Acts 11:26 "The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch." <br>  <br>  The Qur'an makes reference to a city Iram, which Allah destroyed for its evil doings. Until recently there was no record of this city, and it was believed to be only a legend. In 1973, in North-Western Syria, the 4300 year old city of Ebla was excavated. On the cuneiform clay tablets, a record was found of all the cities with who they used to do business. Among them was Iram. <br>  <br>  How and from where did Muhammed gather this information? If, as some claim, he took it from the Bible, how did he manage to correct the Bible's mistakes?|`|fce1c23a13b0b0205377eef3610bebf5aa	Ah But all of this Was Writen Down After it "Happend"<br>  <br>  Why is it so hard to believe that Ppl could LIE thousands of years ago....................|`|e825be3688c359c1a72e2a5ca484b0b0aa	Amen!!! <br>  you are beating on a dead donkey!!|`|85e9584ba23df078165adb4b1b712717aa	cool|`|AA10138269	He didn't.<br>  /|`|AA11278078	He couldn't<br>  The Quran, like the Bible was rewritten and redacted to agree with historical events after the fact.<br>  <br>  Allah...like God, is imaginary<br>  Prayer to either Muslim or Christian, is superstition<br>  Christians and Muslims alike worship equally non-existent gods|`|AA12206021	so what if muhammad made some predictions here and there, the ancient Indians and ancient Chinese could predict a whole person's future just by calculating the person's birthdate.

They also knew that Christ always did the will of His Father in Heaven, also Christ might have made it known to them after His resurrection.

Adam died because of disobedience, Christ gives life because of His obedience to the Father in Heaven|`|VRl1jENHaa	The passage (and the verse after it) reads:<br>  <br>  Matthew 26:39 He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, “O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.” <br>  40 Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “What! Could you not watch with Me one hour? <br>  <br>  What you are assuming is that, as soon as Yeshua (Jesus) prayed the words of verse 39, He left immediately and spoke with the disciples.  However, there is no indication that He did this, because the Scripture tells us He was gone long enough for them to fall asleep.  Therefore, it seems evident that there was a passage of at least 15 - 20 minutes between verses 39 and 40.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question, any of the three Apostles (James, John or Peter, per verse 37) could have heard this part of His prayer before he fell asleep.|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	It did not have to be witnessed.

hJP9y6kjaa	From a religious point of view, the Old Testament says in Genesis that God created man, and gave Man all the animals of the world and all green things and all that for food... now, ignoring the list of things Thou Shalt Not Eat (a few books later in Leviticus, if I remember correctly) that implies that the earth is ours for the taking... I don't think it is explicitly stated that we must be stewards of the earth... at least not in Genesis 1:28-29.<br>  <br>  From a purely subjective point of view, if I ever had to choose between my daughter's life and the life of any animal... or group of animals... or pretty much anything, honestly.... then my daughter lives. So to me, at least some human beings are more important than animals. Many of the rest certainly *act* like animals!<br>  <br>  From an overall perspective of life, human beings are the only ones to date who have the potential to save the Earth from asteroids and the like, and the only ones who have the potential to escape the solar system before the sun goes supernova or whatnot.... so from life's perspective, humans are probably the most important animals on the earth right now.<br>  <br>  That said, we're all in it together. If ocean-born bacteria die, then everything else further up the food chain dies too... krill, fish, whales, everything.<br>  <br>  We're all interconnected in ways that many of us simply don't have the ability to recognize....<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|AA11124121	animals cannot sin..humans can..it's as simple as that.|`|6tYQEwxGaa	I would say that anyone who eats animals (as I do) can't credibly refute that statement.|`|snj9zznvaa	religion is why we think of animals as less than humans<br>  but there is no difference between us|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Don't say that in front of my dog.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	I think that's absolute nonsense!

Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

4sUqTjc8aa	I must agree that it takes far more faith to believe that the universe was created by nothing than to believe that a supreme everlasting being created it all.|`|0c44db9bf3337a894a67a66af6d2192baa	And everything was created by magic sounds more reasonable?<br>  <br>  ------<br>  <br>  "do you really believe the earth was created by accident..."<br>  <br>  No.  In order for there to be an accident, someone must have screwed up.  That doesn't happen in order to create planets.<br>  <br>  ------<br>  <br>  "...and monkeys and humans descended from a common ancestor."<br>  <br>  We evolved from a common ancestor, yes.<br>  <br>  ------<br>  <br>  "Sorry I just can't believe such fairy tales."<br>  <br>  I didn't ask you to.|`|BIl0MOHGaa	No, I don't believe the Earth was created by accident; I have reason to accept that gravity formed the Earth from an interstellar cloud of gas and dust. Also, I have reason to accept that monkeys and humans descended from a common ancestor. In fact, I have much better reasons to accept these concepts than an ancient book of mythology.|`|84gK4XlHaa	You've clearly never taken a class in evolutionary science.  It's pretty hard to call it a "fairy tale" with all the evidence spelled out for you.  Did you know that dolphin embryos develop forelimbs like a mammal's that then recede and become flippers before it's born?  What's the point in that if evolution isn't real?

UmjJmYsjaa	EXACTLY!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I'm a Christian & i know that the bible does not teach the concept of "HELL'<br>  <br>  just read this, taken from the King James BIble.<br>  <br>  ACTS 2:31 - (KJ)"He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.<br>  <br>  Why is Jesus soul not left in Hell? Why was it there in the first place? It funny to see this in the King James but in the NEW king James Version they change it to the proper words.<br>  <br>  Acts 2:31 (NKJV) - " he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption."<br>  <br>  It changes the word to Hades. There are four more words that are improperly translated into Hell. and they are Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, and Tartarus.<br>  <br>  I ask a question about the same subject.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtNDRyJn40j6odYNp2.c_4nty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223210052AAeOpTB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  There is no concept of Hell in the Bible. I asked this question to a Baptist Minitster, a Catholic and many others. One told me that Jesus was in the Safe place in Hell..hahahahah....thats funny....<br>  <br>  well you're right God is Love.<br>  How can he torture people that didnt even have a change to get to know him, like the Pagan Romans or Celtic or Ancient Americans, like the Aztecs, Olmecs. etc....according to MOST religious doctrines they'll be in hell becasue they did not accept Jesus even though they NEVER EVEN HEARD OF HIM.<br>  <br>  If God is Justice, love, that wouldnt be love. Thats mess up. <br>  <br>  The bible does not teach the concept of hell.|`|VncSMLMpaa	You've just been hooked in on some of the scary stuff that churches try and impress people with.<br>  <br>  God wants all men everywhere to come to Him, love Him and serve Him. That is why he sent His son, the Lord Jesus Christ, so that by his willing sacrifice we might be saved. That is merciful because we are not naturally obedient to God but we must try to be so. <br>  <br>  The Bible has it all. Do read it thoroughly while you can.|`|L6E6lDGKaa	Even in the our human experience you must give up the wayward child who chooses his way over yours. That's free will for you. That's love. All of us choose our path in life. So, choose wisely.|`|Wt398Yueaa	The idea of a Hell which lasts for all eternity was created by some people who wanted to manipulate other people. A horrible idea, but it may have had its uses - in dealing with the Vikings, for instance. The combined military might of Europe couldn't stop the Vikings - so the missionaries were sent in. Before they knew what hit them, the poor Vikings had been turned into Christians. <br>  <br>  You are right, a loving God could never create an eternal Hell.|`|AA10988107	If he is not going to do such, he sure is accused of it, but I go by what<br>  is going to happen to Satan, thr false prophet and the beast, these<br>  are the worst to exist, Rev.19:20, 20:7-10; as for others they are<br>  consumed, or Rev.21:8, the second death is as much dust to dust<br>  as the first even if cremation.|`|0yTM98Odaa	I know exactly what you mean!  According to many Christians it's because he "loves us".  Another reason is "we choose hell" but again of course it is completely illogical!  <br>  <br>  Hell is not actually real!<br>  <br>  Hell comes from paganism and was put into Christianity to encourage pagans to convert and to keep people within the church!  Because lets face it when you are told if you leave Christianity you will "burn in hell", it kinda makes you stay out of fear.  <br>  <br>  God does not put anybody in hell.  I don't know what happens when we die but I believe God judges people on how they live their lives and their heart.  i don't believe in a hell.<br>  <br>  It also doesn't make sense how we are apparently sent to hell to be punished for not being perfect when we were created to not be perfect.  It is impossible for humans to ever be perfect because we all make mistakes and have our faults.  So why would God punish us for that.<br>  <br>  Nobody deserves hell, it's unjust and I don't understand why people still believe in it.|`|6jAVElX7aa	He is mercifull if you turn back from your evil ways and acknowledge Him. But if you mock or ridicule Him and His saving grace, and lead others astray, then why would He be merciful?|`|M6VcuiyDaa	Supposedly we deserve it for merely existing, something we never chose to do in the first place.<br>  <br>  The entire concept of the Christian Hell is extremely flawed and obviously invented as a way to scare non-believers into conversion.<br>  <br>  How anyone can justify such a terrible and sadistic belief is beyond me.|`|zKFSCCWOaa	And would you set your child on fire if he disobeyed you?

I go to a Unitarian church because I want to form MY OWN beliefs based on background knowledge from other religious groups because I don't belive everything I'm told! Why would you make such a generalization on a group you know nothing about, you ignominious failure of a Christian!<br>  <br>  Also, there are plenty of generalizations that I could make about the christian community. However just about everyone I know is Christian, and most of them are wonderful people so I do not judge by religion. Idk about me, I guess I'm loosely a Christian. But either way, someone's race, religion, sexual orientation or otherwise is not a reason to label them. We should all be smarter than that.|`|0I6GNzGpaa	The first one is true. <br>  <br>  Youre saying that atheists make fun of christians. But youre saying that we are scared, cant commit to anything,and have closed minds. Why should we not talk **** to you when you guys are going around saying stuff like this. Atheists arent usually the ones who go off and start arguements about religion. Believers with little faith are the ones who post questions like this<br>  <br>  If there was absolute proof then yes i would say that there is a god. Would I worship him?No. What does a god need with our worship? If he is truly a higher being he'd be content with knowing he is superior.He wouldnt need us to prove it to him.But why are you even bringing up this what if question? To me people who even have to bring up their faith have the least faith of all. You need to agrue about it.Not to prove to a non believer its true but to convince yourself it is.|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	I guess I'll start with the last question, if there was proof of a god I would believe, but you religious people have plenty of proof there is no god but keep banging your heads against the wall.

We also drive very slowly in the left hand lane!|`|kQuFzK67aa	Q: You dont believe in God.<br>  A: I believe the concept of a creator being to contradict just about everything I understand about the natural world, so yes.<br>  <br>  Q: You are scared<br>  A: Most of the time no. Obviously if I'm in immediate danger I do get a bit scared but under normal circumstances, no.<br>  <br>  Q: You dont wanted to be commited to anything<br>  A: I have a very serious girlfriend and an almost fanatical devotion to Apple computers. Commitment is not an issue with me.<br>  <br>  Q: You dont want to believe<br>  A: In general or in God? I have nothing against belief in god it just doesn't make sense to me. I belief in a great many things and in many ways consider myself an idealist because of it. I just don't belief in God.<br>  <br>  Q: You wont even listen<br>  A: I do. I do not wish to sound arrogant but I have a more extensive knowledge of the Abrahamic Faiths than many theists do. The reason is religion fascinates me and I enjoy nothing more than learning about it. I just still don't agree with many of it's core hypothesis (which is how I see any statement about the nature of the universe).<br>  <br>  Q: You dont care about Christians<br>  A: Abstractly, I guess this is true but specifically I have a great many Christian friends and relatives, as is not surprising considering you out number us (for now). They are people I care about very much. Their faith is but one part of themselves and with only one or two exceptions not the defining part.<br>  <br>  Q: You make fun of us because you think your are right!<br>  A: Not true, not in my case at least. I make fun of you because you are so steadfast in your belief (I do the same of atheists). I'm of the opinion that anyone who claims to know the truth about the universe is either arrogant, stupid or ignorant. In the third case I try to explain as best I can but in the first two I feel such people deserve to be taken down a peg. As I myself do at times.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this has cleared up some things for you. Contrary to popular belief we are not all like Richard Dawkins. While I belief there is no god and that the very concept is almost laughable I would never claim to know as there is no way to scientifically prove it.<br>  <br>  That being said, I think religious texts are fascinating and immensely enjoyable to read. They offer wonderful fables and are really engrossing myths that can be used as guides to help people live a better life.<br>  <br>  I think were people get into trouble with religion is trying to pass it off as documented fact when even a basic glance at the printed history of the bible shows it's been through so many revisions by so many different people that it's a bit like a game of telephone.
4Te5gVvDaa	Your question and details are a bit incongruous. To answer your primary question: yes it is okay to be gay. I look like a minor also and I'm going on 20 in May.

Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

Hear O' Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is One.<br>  <br>  However, for me, it's summed up by Rabbi Hillel, when asked to recite all the wisdom of the Torah while standing on one foot (by someone trying to mock Judaism).  Hillel responds, "What is hateful to yourself, do not do to others: that is the sum of the law, all else is commentary on that, go and study it."
XoNuUrYoaa	The easiest way without lying, is explaining that saying prayers aloud in public makes you feel uncomfortable.|`|qbelhflAaa	I don't think there is a way to tell them you're atheist without damaging your relationship.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that you keep it to yourself and just pretend to pray etc.<br>  <br>  But if you really want to tell them do it fast, like ripping a band aid off of a hairy leg.

My guess is they will pray anyway as it is sort of their religion and they are entitled to it. I wouldn't say anything at all unless you are really offended in which case I would refer you to what you said. If it is possible though just suck it up because it certainly isn't doing you any harm. If they actually ask you to pray just tell them your not comfortable with that and I'm and sure they will do it instead.|`|AA11336384	I know your problem.

But you could just talk to them and bring it up in a conversation. Like start talking about other religion. See what they think about it, like ask them what they think about atheist and everything...then just let them no. but also make sure that they know that you respect what they do, about praying and so. And if they are shocked in the beginning or anything...just give it some time...they might just have to get use to it...but sooner or later they will understand :D
ymqWa8GNaa	There are two sides to the understanding of willpower.  Having the Peace and Discipline necessary to yield to our Creator is a form of willpower, by being still and overcoming the desire to "be in control" as you ably describe. This is spiritual maturity.  Aligning with His will.  When we are in alignment with Him, we are growing rapidly.<br>  <br>  Wrestling with where our Creator wants us to be, rather than yielding to His will, is a willpower of the flesh, and is a fruitless struggle.|`|cfda9b5d078d37da24e0ff1809dee8d5aa	Sometimes inaction takes a LOT of willpower.|`|Q4jlkW0laa	The two aren't necessarily opposites.

6aIuZZi7aa	It is because pantheism is a relatively unknown philosophy  to many; if more people knew of the concept, then perhaps more would recognize themselves as pantheists. I am not a pantheist, but I can understand the philosophy; if anything can be defined as 'god', it is the universe, which holds power in and of itself, as it encompasses all that exists.  And Raith, it is to my understanding that pantheism is not theism, as theism is defined as the belief in deities; therefore, pantheists could be considered atheists. I recommend the book "Elements of Pantheism" by Paul Harrison for those interested in understanding pantheism.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	It's all in the numbers.|`|paRGbr7Xaa	Isn't Pantheism a type of Theism? You can't really say "theists" are more common than Pantheists since Pantheists are theists. Along with Polytheists, Monotheists, Henotheists, Duotheists, etc. They're all "Theists".

Good, lets have a dig at ourselves and be smug in our own ignorance.<br>  <br>  - Atheist<br>  <br>  we believe in stuff in the universe just happened! Mathematical impossible odds can happen because we say so. Believe in any idea no matter how bizaar but as long as it is not God. Mulitple universes? yes, no God. Parellel universes? yes, no God! <br>  <br>  Okay cue the flying spaghetti monster gag. Ho!Ho! Ho!<br>  Oh and not forgetting the unicorn, unicorn? Do we have one? Ah yes, above my post, the No.1 answer. Phew thought we were without that silly retort, now we can grin smuggingly. Okay our ignorance and lack of arguement to intelligent design is complete. If we stick our fingers in our ears and close tight our eye and chant repeatedly, "no creation, no creation, no creation" it will just go away.<br>  <br>  Ah hah, works every time.<br>  <br>  If you hear a Bible just shout, "NO PROOF!", "CONTRADICTION!", "WRITTEN BY MEN", "FAIRY STORIES"<br>  <br>  No I am not talking about evolution theory, I said the Bible!<br>  <br>  oh dear.....<br>  <br>  The the expected grand finale of thumbs down.<br>  <br>  Thank you. Thank you all. Oh, all for me? Thank you.|`|iI2oc4Ujaa	I don't believe in a god because my mind simply will not allow it. I have tried Christianity time and time again, but I have very scientific and analytical mind. Without proof, or without some hope of proof, I can't believe.<br>  <br>  Life without a god is, for me, nothing too bad. At first I felt lost and scared, because I had no proof that I would live past death, until I got into Michael Newton's theories about reincarnation. He was a hypnotherapist, a science that-- while it is indeed shaky and sometimes unreliable-- was close enough to evidence that I could believe it. Once I found that solace, it didn't bother me not believing in a god.<br>  <br>  Personally, I have a hard time imagining life with a god. Feeling spiritual connections, being able to have faith in the face of all odds... it intrigues me.|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	Why do you believe in god?  And why the one specific conception of god you believe in, rather than the thousands of other gods that humanity has invented or the different sects who believe in similar beings, but have doctrinal differences?<br>  You're asking the wrong question, doubt and skepticism is the default, you have to give me a reason to believe in god, and you should have one as well, so what is it?  Where's your evidence?|`|i9yd7F6Eaa	1. the possibility of god ever existed is way much smaller than all the odd against life formed on earth and the evolution of human being without the input of your god.<br>  <br>  2. it is an answer for you, but not an answer to me and not the answer to life<br>  <br>  3. the bible has been proven wrong -  there is nothing to believe in. god is not equal to love, but a control system <br>  <br>  4. look at the history and the history of church - do they ever tell you their dark side?|`|AA10181489	It isn't that I don't believe in God.  I don't believe it is possible for a god to exist.  That is a very important difference.  Given what we know about physics and the data we have, as well as data from the other sciences, I believe it is an incredible claim beyond reason that such a thing could exist.<br>  <br>  As to how would your life be different?  I don't know.  I have sheltered the homeless, fed the poor with my own food, and truthfully improved the human condition for a large number of people.  We are a herd animal.  Except for sociopaths, who are missing the gene for the empathy emotions, we are conditioned to feel the pain and happiness of other members of our species and other close species like puppies and kittens.  Religion seems to have only one function that I can see, that is to divide humanity into competing tribes so as to justify killing each other.  Members of a religion would of course deny this, but that is because such a statement is an affront to the tribe.<br>  <br>  The one thing that strikes me as interesting is the exceedingly low crime rate of the godless when compared to the religious.  People who are religious at the time  of a commission of a crime represent 98.8% of the criminal population, but only 85% of the population.  People without a religion constitute 0.2% of the criminal population.  The second issue is that the highly religious have a divorce rate 50% higher than atheists, who have the lowest divorce rate.<br>  <br>  I think there are two commonalities in this statistic.  The first is that an atheist does not believe they get a divine do-over and that no magic sky man will come down and fix a damaged marriage.  So they have to do all the hard work themselves.  The second is that if you do not get to see your spouse in heaven, because it doesn't exist, then you have to cherish what little time you get with him or her because there isn't a divine second chance.  A person who looks toward an afterlife would be prone to push problems into the divine future instead of solving their problems today.  I think potential criminals are let down by churches because rather than teach them constructive skills for problem solving, they are told to pray to a magic man, transferring responsibility from themselves to Him.<br>  <br>  Finally many religious ideas are immoral, if seen from outside the religious bubble.  Consider Jesus' comments.  How many tens of thousands of American women are beaten each year?  They are instructed to turn the other cheek and pray for their abuser.  Such a model of non-violence does work in certain well understood circumstances.  The model of Dr King or Gandhi is representative of those circumstances.  However, if the party doing the hitting is a sociopath it is certain to not only fail but to encourage increased abuse and the abuse of children.  It is immoral to give guidance that supports abuse, whether you give it or a god gives it.<br>  <br>  Religious ideas are often useful in well defined circumstances and they work poorly in others.  Religions were formed too early in man's existence to teach a literate people to be effective, but they did great for stone age and bronze age man.  There really wasn't any good alternatives yet.  Just read Proverbs and cringe or the really nasty psalms.<br>  <br>  Your life without god would be just like it is right now, except some of your friends might shun you.<br>  <br>  My life is full, happy and has kept many people alive and safe who are just fellow travelers in life.  I see no reason to add religious mumbo jumbo that just takes away time from being useful.  Why pray one hour a week in a group when you could actually make the world better, if not just your life.  Using the time to fix a broken faucet is time well spent.|`|TYstsM7Yaa	I don't belive in God because i think logically.<br>  Here is what i think.<br>  There is no proof of God, anyone that tries to show proof only uses the bible, I don't see any other evidence. <br>  On the other hand, if i am wrong, and somehow God is real he seems like a jerk.<br>  He allows the tourcher of his own children in hell for not following him.

Surely anyone can sell us out to another nation or to poverty and war for their own prosperity, even an American born citizen. <br>  <br>  It puts a lot of us at ease to think the guy was at the very least born and raised in America. And this is the biggest reason of concern- their loyalty. The majority of Americans support a Republic. <br>  <br>  Do you think the Chinese, Japanese, Pakistani, Afghanistan's would feel very good about someone leading them- whose concerns might not be in their best interest? I think not! Of course he says he is concerned about us- ALL politicians do.. they say a lot of things...<br>  <br>  I don't think it would make me feel any better about him- knowing he was at LEAST from America. I think I'd feel a little better if he didn't want bullets to be bar-coded, guns to be registered, felony's for people who move and don't notify the govt they'vee moved so they know where I am to take my gun. I'd feel really good if the 24% of citizens in a recent poll who didn'tt know where tax return money came from-started taking economics classes. I would feel less embarrassed about him if he didn't try to ask Russia for alliance and jeopardize our a relationship with Poland. If he didn't take the census, or raise cigarette tax 200 PERCENT!! Voting for the reparations for slavery.... the list goes on...
AA12070800	I believe in the possibility of extraterrestrial life.  The universe is so vast, we are always discovering how small our part of it is.  If there is some ultimate force that created/creates life, then it seems like great hubris to imagine we are the only ones in the universe.  It doesn't have any impact on my faith, except to remind me that we humans tend to make ourselves the center of the universe, and tend to want to shrink God down to our ability to grasp.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	Yes, they exist and they may very well be the gods of old.  It is thought that they took a creature similar to us and added their genes and that hybrid was us.  We where created as workers, once the immediate need was filled they seemed to have disappeared. .They did leave a few here and they taught us writing ,language ,math ,architecture ,philosophy etc.  They were aware that a flood was coming the intention was to just let the humans drown , but one of the aliens took mercy and instructed Gilgamesh or Noah or who ever, how to build an ark.  All the interactions with the gods &goddess or God was really the aliens.They monitor us like ants in a science project.  They will be returning .|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Of the hundreds of billions of galaxies just like ours, you can't tell me there are no other planets with life on them.

There was a phase of ascribing anything anomalous to aliens however plausible terrestrial explanations were later found to refute these claims.<br>  <br>  Suppose there were aliens who created us then logically the deity of the aliens would also be our deity. It does not change my perception of deity.<br>  <br>  When we look at archeology then we have to say that ancient science is more advanced than contemporary science. It is easier to believe that people were inspired by God as they claimed than to suppose that aliens surreptitiously direct our fate. I would prefer to think that ancient people were smart enough to make scientific discoveries and subsequently lose them than believe in aliens.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	I accept the possibility of extraterrestrial life.  I generally don't actually believe in things until I have evidence for it, and I'm seen no specific evidence for it, but that certainly doesn't mean they don't exist.  Space is big, after all.  In fact, I think it would be odder if there *wasn't* extraterrestrial life.<br>  <br>  This really has no impact on my faith.  I believe the gods and the universe develop in tandem.  I don't think the gods deliberately created humanity, and they certainly didn't create the entire universe just for our benefit.  I think there are more important things in the universe than us. ;)|`|YUAegpPoaa	I don't think it odd.<br>  <br>  I hope there is extraterrestrial life and do not discount it as a possibility. I don't think I'll get to live long enough to see it proved either way though so if I were an atheist the point would be kinda moot.<br>  <br>  I don't see how it is irreconcilable - but I don't think evolutionary theory is either.<br>  <br>  For the sake of simplistic argument if God made everything why would new life discovered 'off site' be any more unnerving then when scientists discover new species here on the earth?|`|dFBccLExaa	I accept the possibility that there is extraterrestrial life somewhere.

In the belief system I am following we do not only consider extra terrestrial life, but other plane's life forms. But seriously to quote a favorite Author (whose name escapes me at the moment)"Man would be pretty self centered to believe that he is the only intelligent life-form in the universe". That basically says it all.

There are some things that humans are just not supposed to know and I believe this is one of those things. I don't put much thought into this so it really doesn't impact my life.|`|AA10105819	As a Bahá'í, it is completely possible that there are living beings on other planets. It doesn't contradict my religion at all, so there is no reconciliation. Here is one excerpt from the Bahá'í Holy Writings:<br>  <br>  "As to thy question concerning the worlds of God. Know thou of a truth that the worlds of God are countless in their number, and infinite in their range."<br>  ~Bahá'u'lláh, Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh, p. 187<br>  <br>  Worlds of God - so there it is, even the Bahá'í Holy Writings acknowledge the very good possibility of other planetary beings.

Only here could people take the Son of God and crucify Him.

The Bible is full of all kinds of things like ghosts, witches, flashing lights in the sky, angels, and many things which are often lumped in with aliens in todays newspapers.  The Bible does not deny that any of these things exist, but it tells us that we are responsible for the consequences of what we spend our time and effort on.  1 Corinthians 10:23 - 24 on the Believers Freedom tells us<br>  <br>  "Everything is permissible"—but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is permissible"—but not everything is constructive. Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others."<br>  <br>  Maybe these extraterrestrial life exists real, maybe it does not.  Gods universe contains many things which are not known or understood by us.  I will accept Gods truth in whatever form I find it, and if I meet aliens on my front lawn tomorrow it will not give me any cause to doubt my faith in God.<br>  <br>  Science searches for signs of life among the stars.  Alien life is not one of the major concerns of Christianity.  Many people see science and religion as incompatible.  I do not.  They are concerned with different things.  The Bible teaches us about spiritual matters, and it is very clear that matters of the spirit are matters of faith, and not of knowledge.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 8:1 - 3 tells us <br>  <br>  "We know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know. But the man who loves God is known by God.<br>  <br>  We ask a lot of questions.  We find a lot of answers.  We find many more questions.  Faith is not a seed that grows through the application of cutting techniques under the microscope.  God asks us to be open to the world and to accept the Truth.  If I ever do meet another species that seeks communication and understanding with us, I will ask them if they know about God's Love.<br>  <br>  I hope this gives you some idea of how I see this issue in relation to spirituality.  God bless you!|`|JTu1cLkYaa	For the LDS this is no problem. It is in our scriptures that there are other inhabited worlds <br>  <br>  D&C 76:23 For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father— <br>    24 That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God. <br>  <br>  The reason this teaching is not in the Bible, is because the Bible is of and for this world only.|`|WjRqYf6naa	I'm open to the possibility.

1e03893bd2eeaafdc3ef879d2d82dfc1aa	For a certain few it might be the tax deduction ... but I'd like to think that's not true for the majority.  Perhaps it's because the person donating the item found it useful ... they assume soneone else will as well.  Even as an item becomes old and worn ... there are people who like to think it will still be of use to someone ... somewhere.  Of course, depending upon how old and worn ... finding that someone can be very difficult if not impossible.  Still, for the person who thinks this way about things ... it's almost impossible to throw something away.  <br>  <br>  For this reason, I understand the frustration this can cause particulary to charity shops ... because at some point ... an item does truly become worn-out ... and derves to be put to rest ... not passed along.  Rubbish is rubbish ... not useful. <br>  <br>  One other possibility ... particularly if the giver is an older person who lived in the 1930s.  Often such a person seems unable to forget that time of their life when there was a true scarcity of all goods ... leading them to find value in just about any and everything ... no matter how old, tattered, broken, etc. <br>  <br>  I know an older woman who saves milk cartons.  Once I helped clean her storage room ... and when I asked her if she'd like me to throw some away ... she was horrified.  She assured me that somewhere there was a class of school children that would need them for a crafts project.  Well ... the likelyhood of that -- especially connecting the two -- was next to nil ... but she truly believe that someone would need them. <br>  <br>  As for donating solied dipers ... lets just assume that person is a wee tad off normal.  ;-)  Some of the other details came in as I was answering ... we might include a couple of those in this catagory too. <br>  <br>  Still ... I believe you.  I've given time to a local charity shop ... and I saw things arrive that I just otherwise wouldn't have believed unless I'd witnessed it with my own eyes.|`|KR3AYA7faa	Oh Hyacinth!

nQEiNGkeaa	Not sure about Best Senses' advice.<br>  I live in the U.K. in the South West. Whilst it is true that we have become more accepted here, I still wouldn't walk around holding hands with my partner unless I was in a gay friendly area. Soho in London use to be the red light district but now has more gay bars and clubs and is well policed and never had a problem there when holding hands or kissing. Brighton is thought to be the gay capital of the U.K. then you have Canal Street in Manchester. Those are the areas I have been to and feel safe in. <br>  <br>  Like everywhere in the world we have homophobic people and hate crimes do happen but they are few. Just take care where ever you are but like I said, if you are in a gay friendly area you will never have a problem. If you visit London, go to the Astoria Nightclub on the weekend just off Oxford Street / Piccadilly. Brilliant night out. There are loads of bars around the area that are totally gay friendly. The smaller the city you visit the less clubs there are. But even somewhere like Cheltenham near to where I live has some good gay bars and clubs.  <br>  <br>  Just to correct some one else, we have civil ceremonies not gay marriages but they do give us the exact same rights as married straight couples.<br>  <br>  If you want more answers from U.K. people, try asking the question a bit later on as it is now 4.00a.m. over here.

AA11202852	No doubt you're in a tough spot, but the best advice always is be true to yourself. If you come out as an atheist, you will make your mom cry. But she won't stop loving you. Continuing to take communion will be hypocritical, so you need to decide what your priority is right now: keeping peace with your parents, or making a risky declaration of who you really are.<br>  <br>  This is never an easy choice, and folks in this forum can't give you the definitive answer. Either way you go, there will be turmoil. Which do you think you can handle? <br>  <br>  I understand your dilemma, and I will tell you from my own experience that it won't be easy, but the people who love you will still love you, regardless of your choices. The ones who reject you didn't really love you in the first place.|`|hiCSVwchaa	If you think they'll understand, just tell them.<br>   <br>  If you don't think they'll understand, there's no reason you have to tell them right away.<br>  <br>  Maybe bring up a conversation about other religious beliefs/non beliefs?|`|bkav003oaa	Honestly tell them your feelings. <br>  <br>  Be prepared for some shock and more than likely a serious conversation. <br>  <br>  You may even be able to overcome your objections to belief in God.|`|IwXuWX05aa	You asked the same question two times.

However, they typically will turn on the heat and try to force you to convert.<br>  <br>  My advice is to keep a fairly low profile until you're out of the house.  You can show a disinterest in religion, but don't "drop the bomb" unless you have to.  Eventually, they might let off pushing you to church.  Unfortunately, you live under their roof and under their rules.<br>  <br>  Of course, please ignore my advice if you feel I don't know your personal situation.  It's true.  You're the best one to judge your own parents and their reaction.<br>  <br>  In either case, good luck.|`|k9bqzT15aa	No such thing as a atheist. For although they new God, they did not honour him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. So they are without excuse. What sort of church do you go to?  Why do you reject what Jesus did for you? Do you relise what you are doing? Who are you listening to? Turn back to God while you still can and experience his love and forgiveness. You are precious to him and his love is steadfast and true. Come back into the light and enjoy him forever. I will pray for you. Do you know Jesus? If you did you would not do this. Do your parents understand the gospel? What turned you away from the truth?|`|1Ms1QqPTaa	hey idk, but in the meantime I would pass at communion.

You won't lose sleep by telling them truth. If they can't respect you for being honest with them, than something is wrong with them anyway.

M8X0dIOZaa	When Adam and Eve first sinned God killed a ram and used the skins to make clothes for Adam and Eve. This was introduced to illustrate to mankind that because mankind sinned they had to cover sin and that required a sacrifice. For the illustrations purposes that was a ram (sheep species). Adam and Eve's sons, Seth and Able, understood this concept, they sacrificed rams to God to express that they understood they could not be in Gods presence if their sin was not covered... the ram was the covering. Later God ordered Abraham to sacrifice the only son he had fathered with his wife Sarah. Abraham believed God's promise that through his son Isaac God would make a great nation so he supposed that even if he killed his son as a sacrifice God would raise Isaac from the dead. Isaac didn't understand at the time what was going on but submitted himself to his father and allowed himself to be bound and put on the alter. At the last moment God stopped Abraham from killing his only son and provided a ram to be sacrificed in Isaac's place. This introduced the idea of God providing a sacrifice that would cover our sins so we would not be separated from God forever. Once the Israelites were a nation God instituted laws for them in the wilderness and instructed them on how they would worship Him with a temple and the sacrificing of lambs (rams, sheep...etc) The temple, the ram (lamb), all of that is a picture of what was to come. It was the illustration to explain the reality to come. Jesus later described himself as the sacrificial lamb, the lamb who is sain. When Jesus died on the cross He became our sin-covering, just like the clothes God made for Adam and Eve, so we could be in the presence of God once again.<br>  <br>  As for why a lamb and not a goat or cow? Well, it was God who decided what animal to kill to clothe Adam and Eve when they were banished from the garden. It's a lamb because that was the first animal ever killed.|`|mzYHpBm6aa	A jewish rabbi explained it to me this way. In the time of moses the people viewed God as like humans. They believed that by taking food and burning it completely till the smoke rose upward to heaven that they were feeding God.

The belief was that like humans, if God was not fed he would become mean and irritable. |`|6tVMvbiiaa	A repentant sinner would bring a sacrifice to the priest.

It shows how the LORD God Almighty tries to show mankind how they should behave and they frequently do exactly the opposite. However, there are some that remained faithful to the end.<br>  <br>  The LORD God has a perfect right to say that people should not worship idols and false gods. The nations around about the Jewish people were really bad and sacrificed their children to the god Molech<br>  and there were all sorts of dreadful things went on. God did not want His peole to get involved with such things yet they were wayward.<br>  <br>  I think you should realise that God wants all men and women everywhere to come to Him, He does not want any to perish. Through His grace he sent the ord Jesus Christ, His son so that if we believe and are obedient we will have salvation. <br>  <br>  None of us are perfect and the LORD God realises this, so especially does Jesus because he had human nature and we are told that "He was tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin." We are not condemned for doing the wrong things sometimes.

FULFILLED PROPHECY<br>  <br>  Fulfilled prophecy is something that sets the Bible apart from every other religious book. There are 26 other religious books that people of faith believe are divinely inspired (the Vedas, the Bhagavad-Gita, the Mahabharata, the Upanishads, the Qur'an, the Book of Mormon, the Tripitaka, etc.). Of these twenty-six books, none of them, not a single one, contains any specific, fulfilled prophecies!<br>  <br>  The Bible, however, is filled with hundreds of specific, detailed prophecies that were written hundreds of years before their fulfillment! In fact, an amazing 27% of the Bible (more than 1 out of every 4 verses) contains what was predictive prophecy at the time that it was written. And the authors of the Bible did not just predict some vague things like Nostradamus or Jeanne Dixon (who by the way, have proven to be wrong over and over again), they were very specific. Consider some of the more than 100 different and very specific prophecies made concerning the Messiah, who the Old Testament prophesied would come.<br>  <br>  The Old Testament foretold, hundreds of years in advance, very specific details about: the Messiah's ancestry, that He’d be born of the seed of Abraham (Gen. 12:1-3, 22:18), of the tribe of Judah (Gen 49:10), of the house of David (2 Samuel 7:12f), etc. The city in which He would be born (Micah 5:2), that He’d come while the temple was still standing (Malachi 3:1), that He would be born of a virgin (Isaiah 7:14), that He would perform miracles (Isaiah 35:5-6), that He’d be rejected by His own people (Psalm 118:22; 1 Peter 2:7), the precise time in history when He would die (Daniel 9:24-26; 483 years after the declaration to reconstruct the city of Jerusalem in 444 B.C. This was fulfilled to the very year.), how He would die (Psalm 22:16-18, Isaiah 53; Zech 12:10), that He would rise from the dead (Psalm 16:10; Acts 2:27-32), and there are many more. All of these prophecies and hudreds others have been literally fulfilled.<br>  <br>  The skeptic says: “Maybe Christians inserted those prophecies back into the Old Testament after Jesus lived.”<br>  <br>  Not a chance. How do we know? There exists today hundreds of manuscript copies of the Old Testament that predate the time of Christ’s birth. These ancient copies of the Old Testament, dating back to the third century B.C., verify that these prophecies concerning the Messiah were already in place. In 1947 a shepherd boy tending his father’s sheep in Qumran, north and to the west of the Dead Sea in Israel, made an amazing discovery while looking for a lost sheep. There in Qumran, in a hillside cave that had laid untouched for nearly two thousand years, he discovered an ancient collection of hand written copies of the Old Testament. These scrolls had been hidden in caves by the Essenes, a Jewish sect living in Qumran, 2,000 years ago. These scrolls and writings (now known as the Dead Sea Scrolls) represented every book of the Old Testament except the Book of Esther, and are considered one of the greatest discoveries in modern times. It’s manuscript evidence like this Isaiah scroll that dates back to about 100 B.C. that proves, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the Old Testament, and its many prophecies concerning the Messiah, was finished long before Jesus was even born.<br>  <br>  The skeptic says: “How do you know that the Dead Sea Scrolls date back to before Christ?”<br>  <br>  Teams of scholars determined the scrolls age by examining 1. The pottery that housed the manuscripts 2. The weave and pattern of the manuscript cloths 3. The form of the characters 4. The spelling of the words 5. The coins found alongside the manuscripts.<br>  <br>  The skeptic says: “Perhaps Jesus was not the Messiah, but just accidentally or even deliberately set out to fulfill these prophecies.”<br>  <br>  First, it’s hard to think of any person deliberately setting out to fulfill prophecies that would result in a short life and an excruciating drawn out death on a cross. Secondly, how does a man deliberately choose the lineage he is born into, the time period in which he is born, -the city in which he is born? Was the fulfillment of these prophecies an accident? Peter Stoner, a mathematician, and Professor Emeritus of Science at Westmont College, in his book Science Speaks (Moody 1963) calculated the odds of a single man fulfilling just eight of the prophecies that Jesus fulfilled as the mathematical improbability of 1 in 10 to the 17th. That is a HUGE number. One in ten to the seventeenth power. That's a one with seventeen zeros after it (100,000,000,000,000,000). If we had 100 quadrillion 1” x 1.5” tiles we could cover every square inch of dry land on planet Earth. The fact that these prophecies and hundreds of others have been fulfilled, even though they were spoken hundreds and even thousands of years before their fulfillment, is strong evidence that a God, who is all-knowing and all-powerful, orchestrated the Bible’s co|`|raFYuWouaa	Just believe in god and do not question his or hers doings I know it is hard to grasp but this is what God asks of us.<br>  God is cruel and heartless sometimes and has a very sick sense of humor but trust in God and believe in God and try to be the best person you can be in this life and you will be forgiven of your sins if you ask.|`|vDr5aROwaa	I do believe that you shouldn't have a problem believing the bible, being it is God's inspired word.

He loves the people.  But he really does not like thier actions.)  He warns against it in Luke 12, and criticizes the Pharisees and religious leaders in Luke 11 for hypocrisy.<br>  <br>  5.  God is not mean and vengeful.  He is just and powerful, but He is loving and merciful.  Yes, those who do wrong in the Bible get what their deeds deserve, like Jezebel and Ahab, but remember people like the widow whom God empowered Elijah to help.  She was going to die from lack of food, but God saved her!<br>  <br>  6.  He loves the people more than anything.  So much that He gave Himself for them.  But when they reject Him, He has no choice.  He cannot let anything unholy into His Heaven, and He is the God of Justice.  But salvation is offered so freely to anyone who chooses to accept it!  Even you!<br>  <br>  7.  But your mom would ground you for stealing something from the store or punching someone at school (or at least, she should; it's proper discipline).  Not to say that Hell is just discipline to make you learn your lesson, but Hell is where you must go for being unholy and unrighteous.  Do you know something?  Hell was never designed for humans.  It was designed for Satan and his demons, but when humans took on the sin nature, they were seperated from God, and they couldn't be reconciled until Jesus came and paid the price for our sins.  "Jesus told him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me." (John 14:6)  There is no other way to Heaven, and all other ways lead to Hell.

Obviously, God is.  Honest.  Stop and look at it for a moment.  Yes, God loves everyone, and yes, there is a hell.  Evidently, these two concepts are not mutually exclusive to God.  <br>  <br>  God does love us and has given us rules to live by.  When we break any of His rules (Laws) that is sin.  Every human has sinned.  No human is "good."  All of us are sinners.  Because God is perfectly holy, He can tolerate absolutely no sin in His Presence.   The only way we can come into His Presence at all (as in going to Heaven) is to be completely sinless.  The only way for a human to do that is to accept jesus' work on the cross, and have His righteousness credited to our account and our sins credited to His.  He has already paid for them on the cross.  We need to repent and accept that and trust Him and follow Him.  <br>  <br>  There is not a single thing (other than accepting Jesus' payment for our sins) that will make a human 'good' enough to come into the Presence of God Himself.  It's only humans that think humans can be 'good.'  <br>  <br>  God does love us so He has made a way for us to live|`|bTA5ndeMaa	We are taught that God is love.

HJ9eOk37aa	First of this is cantonese.<br>  <br>  Time really flies. In a blink of an eye I'm celebrating my third anniversary with my boyfriend. Thinking back to how it all started, it felt like a dream. I enjoyed spending my days with him and I feel very lucky.<br>  <br>  But for some reason, no matter how sweet and devoted he is or how stable the relationship is, sometimes I worry about some dumb things.<br>  <br>  How can it not work? Sometimes things like relationship can change in an instant. This is true even for other couples, no matter how long they've had a relationship.<br>  <br>  At one moment everything's fine. Suddenly he cheats and before you know it, you don't want to date anymore (break up). <br>  <br>  But my boyfriend says that could not possibly happen to me.<br>  <br>  I hope so too..|`|7w1kjPCiaa	The time passes well quick, transfers the eye on with the boyfriend third anniversary.<br>  Knows returns by knows starts to have already the matter, seems a dreamland .<br>  With every day all crosses in once well is happy<br>   I to think oneself has a percentage misfortune.<br>  But is does not know a solution,<br>   but even if family several sweet, relationship several stable, has several single-mindedly, some several Zhong Yi everybody ..... <br>  Sometimes I can know bury d silly wild.<br>  Is exactly possibly not work, the sentiment is already wild, sometimes really is may the speech change changes.<br>  Looks other people, even if the racket tows for many years to be able to separate<br>   the sudden speech not to clamp, but sudden speech Zhong Yi left second, does not want to pat suddenly<br>   tows the boyfriend speech, possibly can have o suddenly is on my body <br>  I all hoped… <br>  <br>  I think its quite beautiful...<br>  This is a direct translation, so it may not make much sense.|`|0470cad9084f88d5c0e2e1fe219220d5aa	It’s not Mandarin, it’s a Cantonese writing which google or any other Chinese to English translate function can‘t do. Most Chinese don’t even quite understand most part of this article if they aren’t Cantonese. And sorry, I’m not Cantonese neither. I only can guess…<br>   <br>  The first paragraph is easy to understand.<br>  “Time goes by fast. It’s the third-year anniversary since we have been dating. It’s like a dream to me when I think of everything about him since day one. He makes me so happy every day just being able to be with him. I truly believe I’m a lucky person.”<br>  <br>  Second paragraph is difficult to understand by non-Cantonese. Just my wild guess.<br>  “However, I wonder if I really know him at all. I wonder if our sweet relationship is stable, if he’s willing to be Mine only, if he’s willing to make a commitment. Sometimes, I feel so silly when I have this kind of thoughts <br>  It probably won’t last as I wish. Things change, so does love. Just looking at people around me, some couples had been dating for years and yet broke up all the sudden. Some of them were out of boredom, some were out of cheating, or just tired of dating the same old person.<br>  However, my boyfriend assured me that it will never happen to us.<br>  Oh, how I wish!"
AA11172694	In 1604, King James I of England authorized that a new translation of the Bible into English be started. It was finished in 1611, just 85 years after the first translation of the New Testament into English appeared (Tyndale, 1526). The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants. Its flowing language and prose rhythm has had a profound influence on the literature of the past 300 years. The King James Version present on the Bible Gateway matches the 1987 printing.

Read up on the Canonization of the New Testament and you will see why those books were not included.  You said that "Jesus is your best bet,"  but then you recomend the book of Judas.  There is definitely a contradiction there.  Jesus lived 2,000 years ago, and you say that he was the first man.  Why does that make sense?<br>  Garbage in garbage out.  I highly advise that you watch what you put into your brain.  Read the good stuff: the Canonized Bible.  Those other books were left out because they were inconsistent, not old enough, and/or lacking evidence to prove there authenticity.

Do you believe God is holy?<br>  I believe all of the Gods and Goddesses are Holy, but not perfect. Perfection means that there is no change; no change means nothing could be created, as creation involves change/chaos. Not even the Gods themselves would exist without it. So nothing can be perfect, per se. I do believe they're the closest thing TO perfection, though.<br>  <br>  2. Do you believe God can be surrounded by sin?<br>  No. There's no such thing as 'sin'; Humans have the will to do something bad or not. Doing something bad will, however, create Isfet, (or that which is bad in the world), and you'll get the same in return. Isfet can affect the Gods but not in the same way as with us Humans, and they're not constantly 'surrounded' by it. <br>  <br>  3. If not then how will you be able to be with God when you die?<br>  When I die, I will go to the Hall of Two Truths, where my heart will be weighed against the Feather of Ma'at (Ma'at is balance, order, truth, and what's good in the world. The feather is Her symbol). If my heart weighs less than the feather, I will be going to the Duat (a place like Heaven) where I can live eternally and become an Akh (or blessed dead/ancestor). If my heart weighs more, however, my soul will be devoured by the monster Ammit and I will exist no longer.<br>  <br>  4. Would you trully like to know how?<br>  I already do. I believe that where you go after you die is connected to what religion you follow. So while I'm going to the Duat, Christians will be going to Heaven or Hell, etc. But no matter what I believe all Gods are part of one higher power. God is everywhere. You don't need to believe one certain thing or another to feel the Divines presence and love!<br>  <br>  May the Gods/God bless you.|`|51609c1cabd0614657114700e575555baa	Would a believing non-believer not be a believer?<br>  <br>  besides that, are there real non-believers?

AA10213963	The Qur'an speaks about the basic dignity of all human beings. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) spoke about the equality of all human beings, regardless of their race, color, language or ethnic background. Shari`ah recognizes the rights of all people to life, property, family, honor and conscience. <br>  <br>  Islam emphasizes the establishment of equality and justice, both of these values cannot be established without some degree of tolerance. Islam recognized from the very beginning the principle of freedom of belief or freedom of religion. It said very clearly that it is not allowed to have any coercion in the matters of faith and belief. The Qur'an says, (There is no compulsion in religion) (Al-Baqarah 2:256). <br>  <br>  If in the matters of religion, coercion is not permissible, then by implication one can say that in other matters of cultures and other worldly practices it is also not acceptable. In surat Ash-Shura Allah says to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), (If then they turn away, We have not sent you as a guard over them. Your duty is but to convey (the Message)…) (Ash-Shura 42:48). In another place Allah says, (Invite (all) to the Way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious. Your Lord knows best, who have strayed from His Path, and who receive guidance) (An-Nahl 16:125). <br>  <br>  Further, Allah says to the Believers, (Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and beware (of evil): if you do turn back, know then that it is Our Messenger's duty to proclaim (the Message) in the clearest manner) (Al-Ma’idah 5:92). <br>  <br>  One can also cite Allah's words: (Say: 'Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger: but if you turn away, he is only responsible for the duty placed on him and you for that placed on you. If you obey him, you shall be on right guidance. The Messenger's duty is only to preach the clear (Message)) (An-Nur 24:54). <br>  <br>  All these verses give note that Muslims do not coerce people; they must present the message to them in the most cogent and clear way, invite them to the truth and do their best in presenting and conveying the message of God to humanity, but it is up to people to accept or not to accept. Allah says, (And say, 'The truth is from your Lord, so whosoever wants let him believe and whosoever wants let him deny’) (An-Nahl 16:29). <br>  <br>  As for being anti-semetic, Arabs are semites too. I am an Arab and Muslim, being anti-semetic would be anti-Myself? Muslims are anti-injustice. When we see the state of Israel practicing gross injustice against Palestinians and lebanese we abhor it and condemn it. We don't over look it, as it must be addressed. <br>  <br>  The path of Islam of that of moderation -middle path.  The Almighty says: "And thus have we willed you to be a community of the middle way." The Prophet said:“ The religion is easy and whosoever will deal with religion harshly, it will defeat him.  So be straight, follow the middle course, give good news and seek help by moving in the morning or the evening or part of the night .” (Al-Bukhari 38) <br>  <br>  Muslims have to follow the middle path, the path that has no extremes or excesses. You can't be a true Muslim and be radical in your belief. <br>  <br>  In interesting story that illustrates this:<br>  Anas reported that three persons came to the wives of the Holy Prophet to enquire about acts of piety of the Prophet. When they were informed of them, they considered them little as it were and said: I fast all the day long and will not break. And another said: Where are we in comparison with the Holy Prophet while Allah has forgiven his past sins and what will be in future. One of them said: as for me, I pray all night long. And another man said: I keep aloof from women and shall never marry. Then the Holy Prophet came to them and said: Are you the persons saying such and such things? Behold! By Allah, I fear Allah more than your selves and I am most dutiful among you to Him, but still I keep fast and break it, and keep up prayer and keep awake at night and take wives, So whoever turns away from my way is not of me.

In the UK the clerics pick on young muslim males who live in deprived areas where jobs are hard to find and brain wash them into doing their vile acts. It is never the clerics that commit suicide it is always their disciples. We had bombing in the UK from the IRA supposed Christian committing atrocities but this all stopped when prosperity came to Ireland. Maybe the way to stop terrorism is to invest in jobs and futures instead of wasting money on armaments.

Cowardly according to who? Getting on an airplane and flying it into a building is a lot of things. Horrible, cruel, fanatical, monstrous...but not particularly 'cowardly'. Cowardly would have been to do it by remote control, or leap out with a parachute before it struck.<br>  <br>  As for 'what it is' that makes them do things like this, I would say rage and feelings of impotence. Not sexual impotence, but powerlessness. When you're angry at a person or a group (or a nation) and you have no political or other means to strike at them, what do you do? You use violence. <br>  <br>  Personally, I would take all violent extremists of ANY culture and throw them all into a pit together and let them kill each other. But you asked why they do it, so I thought I'd answer you.<br>  <br>  P.S. It's also not 'indiscriminate'. They're VERY specific about what people they target. They simply don't care about our definitions of 'innocence'.|`|er93Xxwkaa	hmmmm could this have anything to do with it?<br>  <br>  The Qur'an:<br>   <br>  Sura (2:191) - And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution [of Muslims] is worse than slaughter [of non-believers]<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (2:244) - Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (2:216) - Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (3:56) - As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (3:151) - "Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority."  This speaks directly of killing Christians, since they believe in the Trinity (ie. what Muhammad incorrectly believed to be 'joining companions to Allah').<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (4:74) - Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (4:76) - “Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah…”<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (4:89) - They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (4:95) - Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward,- <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (5:33) - The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (8:12) - I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (8:15) - O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (8:39) - And fight with them until there is no more persecution and religion should be only for Allah<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (8:57) - If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (8:59-60) - And let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip (Allah's Purpose). Lo! they cannot escape.  Make ready for them all thou canst of (armed) force and of horses tethered, that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of Allah and your enemy<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (9:5) - So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (9:14) - Fight them, Allah will punish them by your hands and bring them to disgrace...<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (9:20) - Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah's way are of much greater worth in Allah's sight. These are they who are triumphant.  The "striving" spoken of here is Jihad.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (9:29) - Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (9:30) - And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may Allah destroy them; how they are turned away! <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (9:38-39) - "O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place"  This is a warning to those who refuse to fight, that they will be punished with Hell.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (9:41) - Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah! That is best for you if ye but knew<br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (9:73) - O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (9:88) - But the Messenger, and those who believe with him, strive and fight with their wealth and their persons: for them are (all) good things: and it is they who will prosper. <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (9:111) - Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Qur'an: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah? then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (9:123) - O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (21:44) - We gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers until the period grew long for them; See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? Is it then they who will win? <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (25:52) - "Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness, with the (Qur'an)."   "Strive against" is Jihad, obviously not in the personal context.  It's also significant to point out that this is a Meccan verse.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (47:4) - So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners,<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (47:35) - Be not weary and faint-hearted, crying for peace, when ye should be uppermost: for Allah is with you,<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (48:17) - There is no blame for the blind, nor is there blame for the lame, nor is there blame for the sick (that they go not forth to war). And whoso obeyeth Allah and His messenger, He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow; and whoso turneth back, him will He punish with a painful doom. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (48:29) - Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard (ruthless) against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (61:4) - Surely Allah loves those who fight in His way <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (61:10-12) - "O ye who believe! Shall I lead you to a bargain that will save you from a grievous Penalty?- That ye believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that ye strive (your utmost) in the Cause of Allah, with your property and your persons: That will be best for you, if ye but knew! He will forgive you your sins, and admit you to Gardens beneath which Rivers flow, and to beautiful mansions in Gardens of Eternity."  This verse was given in battle.  It uses the Arabic word, Jihad.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Sura (66:9) - O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. Hell will be their home, a hapless journey's end.|`|f8822d00ffd9a02b698a5cf7420d4c92aa	YOU, sir, are gobbling up the propaganda the American goverment is feeding you.

That verse was only applied when the Prophet(PBUH*) was alive because people were trying to kill him and the idol worshippers of Arabia were worshipping false Gods.  That rule does not apply today.  The terrorists think they will get into Jinnah if they kill innocent people.  Muslims are only commanded to kill if it is in self defense, they are at war, or if the state of Islam and the people are threatened and if they are oppressed like Palestine.  What the terrorists are doing is NOT Islamic and is not obeying ALLAH's(SWT) laws.

I do not say someone who is not willing to entertain other ideas because you can have situations where unknowledgeable people present ideas and wise people do not listen to them, so I say that it truly stems from a person who believes things or really knows things but according to a limited and shortsighted analysis. <br>  <br>  That can apply to anybody about anything. If you adopt evolution with a small view then you may be close minded, if you adopt a religion with a small view then you may be a close minded person as well. Both will argue for their point of view but both will be arguing and disputing without understanding the wider implications and coincidents. <br>   <br>  I  find that this is the characteristic most noticeable in people who I might tend to view as a little closeminded, people who adopt things easily because it sounds right or based on authority only and become the fiercest defenders or opposers of things. To me this qualifies as close minded because what you have adopted has been adopted upon a very small view of the matter which does not properly take in to acount the breadth of the matter, the wideness of its meanings.

No one can interfere in this.<br>  But for the sins (harmful acts) he has committed to other human beings God will forgive only if the harmed person forgives him for the mistake.  Someone else can bear our sins in not logical. Then everyone will do sins and ask someone to bear the burden for him. In the Day of Judgement only Truth & Justice will prevail. Even if a thorn has pricked someone's foot, he will be rewarded for the pain he sufferred due to that. If someone has done a small good deed like feeding a hungry dog, then he will see the reward for this action in the next world. This sounds logical.|`|e21192e41fa3fc6489a5a65c532632feaa	That's contradiction. According to Christians vengeance will only be if one doesn't believe in Jesus. The Christians teachings seem to suggest that once you have accepted Jesus as your saviour, then all will be forgiven. It therefore means that, yes, I can repent just when I am seconds away from death and all my sins will be washed away.<br>  <br>  This is the christian teaching. I am no Christian, though.

Remember how the other thief was taunting Jesus and the first thief basically told the  other guy to shut up because Jesus was Christ and he was on the cross not because of something bad he had done but because of him being our savior? Well Jesus told the "nice" thief that he would see him in heaven.<br>  <br>  This is how it went<br>  Luke Chapter 23:<br>  <br>  41     And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. (this is from the believing thief "the nice one")<br>  42     And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. (also from the believer)<br>  43     And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. <br>  <br>  <br>  See, he trusted Christ just before his own death and Jesus forgave him and told him that he would be in paradise (heaven) with him.<br>  <br>  <br>  (I'm sorry that I don't really know why your question was deleted.

Pero siento que tenemos el poder de controlarlo, solo es cuestion de concentrarse dentro del sue?o y hacerlo sin miedo, lo he logrado muy pocas veces... y las pocas veces que lo he logrado e intentado volar pero no puedo elevarme ja ja ja.... nadamas siento que me caigo.....

Capialism is the driving force behind the wars the U.S. is involved with in Iraq, to take control of the oil supply in the mid east. Blood for oil. The teachings of God and Christ are anti-life.

The transfiguration shows that Jesus is the divine Word who was made flesh.<br>  <br>  John 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. <br>  <br>  2. Exodus 33:18-23  Moses said, "Please show me your glory."  19  And he said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name 'The LORD.' And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.  20  But," he said, "you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live."  21  And the LORD said, "Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock,  22  and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by.  23  Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen."<br>  <br>  Exodus 34:29  When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand as he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God.<br>  <br>  3. Mount Sinai (Horeb), sermon on the mount, mount of olives<br>  Deuteronomy 11:29  And when the LORD your God brings you into the land that you are entering to take possession of it, you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.<br>  <br>  4. Moses represented the Law and Elijah represented the Prophets while Jesus said that He came to fulfill the Law and the Prophets.<br>  <br>  Matthew 5:17  Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<br>  <br>  5.

Racionalmente le das órdenes, pero tu cerebro no las obedece. Es como si existiera una gran distancia entre lo que quieres y lo que consigues. Existen ocho reglas fundamentales que el cerebro cumple escrupulosamente y que tenemos que tener en cuenta a la hora de producir cualquier cambio. <br>  <br>  1. Todo pensamiento o idea produce una reacción física<br>  Todos los pensamientos afectan a todas las funciones del organismo. Los pensamientos de preocupación desencadenan cambios en el estómago, que a la larga pueden derivar en úlceras. Los pensamientos de ira aumentan el nivel de adrenalina a la sangre, produciendo diversos cambios en el cuerpo. Los pensamientos de ansiedad y miedo aumentan la rapidez del pulso. Todas las ideas que tienen un fuerte contenido emocional casi siempre alcanzan el inconsciente (la mente del sentimiento). Una vez aceptadas, éstas ideas continúan produciendo la misma reacción corporal una y otra vez. <br>  <br>  Es necesario, por lo tanto, romper ese círculo por algún sitio si no queremos caer una y otra vez en las mismas respuestas psicofisiológicas. <br>  <br>  2. Lo que se espera tiende a hacerse realidad<br>  El cerebro y el sistema nervioso responden a imágenes mentales, ya sean imágenes internas o externas. Las imágenes formadas se convierten en pautas fijas y el inconsciente utiliza todos los medios de que dispone para llevar a cabo su plan. Preocuparse es una forma de programar respuestas físicas que no deseamos y el inconsciente actúa para que se cumpla la situación representada en las imágenes. "Las cosas que temía han acabado por sucederme". <br>  <br>  Muchas personas padecen ansiedad crónica, que es simplemente una expectativa mental inconsciente de que va a ocurrir algo terrible. Por otra parte, todos conocemos personas que parecen tener una magia especial. Parece que la vida les colma de bendiciones sin motivo aparente. De ellos decimos que tienen suerte. Lo que parece buena suerte es en realidad expectativa mental positiva, una honda convicción de que ellos merecen que todo les salga bien. Nos convertimos en lo que pensamos. <br>  <br>  Nuestra salud física depende en gran medida de nuestra expectativa mental. Los médicos reconocen que si un paciente espera seguir enfermo, lisiado, paralizado, desvalido o incluso morir, tiende a hacerse realidad la situación esperada. <br>  <br>  3. Al tratar con tu mente o con la otra persona, la imaginación es más poderosa que el conocimiento<br>  LA IMAGINACION ANULA FACILMENTE LA RAZON. Este es el motivo por el que ciertas personas se precipitan a ciegas hacia actos o situaciones irracioriales. Los crímenes violentos originados por los celos casi siempre tienen la causa en una imaginación hiperactiva. <br>  <br>  Muchos se sienten superiores a los que pierden sus ahorros en manos de timadores o siguen ciegamente a demagogos. Se ve fácilmente que estas personas sobrepasan su razón. A menudo estamos ciegos ante nuestras propias supersticiones, prejuicios o creencias irracionales. Las ideas que contienen una fuerte emoción, como la ira, el odio, el amor a nuestras creencias políticas o religiosas, son difíciles de modificar mediante el uso de la razón. <br>  <br>  4. No se puede estar de acuerdo y al mismo tiempo tener ideas opuestas<br>  Se pueden almacenar muchas ideas. La regla hace referencia al reconocimiento de una idea por la mente consciente. Muchas personas intentan obtener ideas opuestas simultáneamente. Un hombre podría creer en la honestidad y esperar que sus hijos sean honestos, y no obstante embarcarse en prácticas comerciales levemente deshonestas. Puede intentar justificar sus actos diciendo, "Todos mis competidores lo hacen, es una práctica "aceptada". Sin embargo, no puede eludir la tensión y su efecto sobre el sistema nervioso, originada por sostener ideas opuestas. <br>  <br>  5. Una vez que una idea ha sido aceptada por la mente inconsciente, permanece hasta que otra idea la reemplaza<br>  Esta regla va asociada a la siguiente: cuanto más tiempo permanece una idea, mayor es la resistencia a que se la reemplace por otra idea nueva. <br>  <br>  Una vez que una idea ha sido aceptada, tiende a permanecer, y cuanto más tiempo actúa, más tiende a convertirse en una forma habitual de pensar. Así es como se forman los hábitos, buenos o malos. Tenemos pautas de pensamiento y acción. Anótese bien: "TODA ACCION VA PRECEDIDA DEL PENSAMIENTO". Si queremos modificar nuestras acciones, tenemos que empezar modificando nuestros pensamientos. Aceptamos ciertos hechos como verdaderos. Aceptamos que el Sol sale por el este y se pone por el oeste, incluso cuando está nublado y no podemos verlo. Tenemos muchas pautas de pensamiento que son incorrectas y sin embargo se han fijado. Existen personas que en momentos críticos beben whisky, fuman o consumen calmantes para rendir con eficiencia. Todo eso es incorrecto, pero la idea está ahí y resulta una pauta fija de pensamiento. Habrá oposición a reemplazarla con una nueva idea. <br>  <br>  6. Un síntoma inducido emocionalmente, si persiste lo suficiente, tiende a causar cambios orgánícos<br>  La ciencia médica reconoce que más del 60 % de las enfermedades humanas son psicosomáticas. La función de un órgano o de una parte del cuerpo se ha perturbado por la reacción del sistema nervioso a ideas negativas que sostiene el inconsciente. No se quiere decir con esto que toda persona que se queja de una enfermedad está enferma emocionalmente o es neurótico. Hay enfermedades causadas por gérmenes, parásitos o virus. ?Somos un conjunto inseparable de mente y cuerpo! Si temes continuamente que tu salud se debilite, sí hablas constantemente de tus nervios de estómago o tus migraftas debidas a la tensión, a la larga pueden producirse cambios orgánicos. <br>  <br>  7. cada sugerencia llevada a la práctica disminuye la resistencia a sucesivas sugerencias<br>  Cuanto más tiempo dura una tendencia mental, más fácil es de seguir. Una, vez que se forman los hábitos se vuelven más fáciles de seguir y más difíciles de romper. <br>  <br>  Cuando el inconsciente ha aceptado una sugerencia, se hace más fácil que acepte nuevas sugerencias y las lleve a la práctica. En ello se basa la publicidad y el márketing. <br>  <br>  8. En lo concerniente a la mente inconsciente y sus funciones, a mayor esfuerzo consciente menor es la respuesta del inconsciente<br>  ?La "Fuerza de Voluntad" no existe en realidad! (en muchas ocasiones). Si padeces insomnio has aprendido que "cuanto más te empe?as en dormirte, más te mantienes despierto". Al tratar con el inconsciente tómate las cosas con calma". Hay que saber dar las instrucciones al cerebro para que entienda exactamente lo que deseamos de él. El cerebro no entiende el lenguaje consciente, ya que utiliza un lenguaje que no está basado en palabras, sino en la estructura que tiene el pensamiento. Por eso no sirven todos esos libros de autoayuda en los que se trata de realizar autoafirmaciones. Esos libros te recomiendan frases del estilo: "Soy capaz de sentirme bien". Si pensar eso así funcionara, no habría problemas psicológicos. El cerebro no entiende ese tipo de frases. El cerebro funciona por estructuras. Decir "Soy capaz de sentirme bien" llega a nuestra parte racional, pero no hace que cambiemos nuestra forma de sentir. <br>  <br>  Saber cuál es la estructura que hace que nuestro cerebro entienda nuestras órdenes, es un Informe que te enviaremos próximamente, dentro del Boletín gratuito "Psicología Que Funciona", del que ya eres suscriptor, y que se titula "Como Alfred Hitchcock supo entender el funcionamiento del cerebro mucho antes que la mayor parte de los psicologos"|`|0a110fb21ffd22489607d6e60e86bfb5aa	primero: en todas las civilizaciones a habido gente o personas con mas intelecto que otras, llamese sabios, profetas, escribas,<br>  segundo cuando se escribio la biblia (que fueron libros robados de otras civilizaciones, que ahora seria largo de explicar), nunca dijero que vivian en el cielo sino en las alturas que es diferente.|`|3zLLkLORaa	Excelente Reflexion....<br>  SALUDOS....|`|9dd298b6194a53be20e42df0d539aaa0aa	vaya ,,vaya,,,la yegua balla saltando la baya,,,no digo yo,,no es la tierra la mala ,,es la raza la bruta,,disculpame,,pero eso me inspira tu especulacion ,tan falta de mente,,,|`|nPCCRXBsaa	como sabes que eran analfabetos? no lo eran  la biblia ense?a que Jesus subio a los cielos en espiritu te aconsejo que leas la biblia|`|1df231fa879969ea6fef90142fb77048aa	he ahi el dilema. por ahi an de andar algunos libros que estan ocultos . y quizas esten en el Vaticano. pero  por alguna razon no  quieren que el publico sepa. pero si a de a ver mas  libros. acerca del senor Jesus.|`|29d0a3ee8a7e69fd7eaad2dd2b4506b4aa	Unos pecadores escribieron la biblia? no entiendo.

Además, la Biblia ha sido modificada para hacerle decir lo que cada religión quería que dijera. Una de las supresiones más importantes fue la de las palabras de Jesús cuando dijo que no se necesitaba ningún intermediario para llegar al Reino de los Cielos , pues cada uno saldría por sí mismo de acuerdo a sus obras.

Die Auferweckung des Lazarus zum Beispiel k?nnte damit zusammenh?ngen, das eben jener durch ein Gift in einen Scheintot viel und Jesus kannte eben das Gegenmittel (war neulich sogar auf Phoenix zu sehen). Der Brennende Dornbusch hingegen war etwas, was sich die Menschen damals nicht erkl?ren konnten. Heute wei? man, dass es sich dabei um eine spezielle Pflanzenart handelt, die sich so fortpflanzt.<br>  <br>  2) Theologie<br>  Man muss einfach an manche Dinge glauben, so kann die "Speisung der 40.000" bis heute nicht eindeutig erkl?rt werden.<br>  <br>  Der Glaube in unserer heutigen Zeit wird oft von der Wissenschaft ersetzt, wir wissen heute viel mehr als die Menschen vor 2000 Jahren. Dennoch gibt es nach wie vor ungekl?rte Ph?nomene, die sich nicht erkl?ren lassen und eine Frage ist nach wie vor ungekl?rt: Gibt es Gott?<br>  Solange nicht das Gegenteil eindeutig bewiesen ist, muss man davon ausgehen, dass es ihn gibt!|`|11574b6ef141722dcfebf33b966d6af8aa	Es mag ihn vielleicht gegeben haben.

Mal ins Lateinische, dann vom Lateinischen ins Deutsche..und immer so, wie die "hohen Prediger", sprich Bisch?fe und P?pste es zur jeweiligen Zeit gebraucht haben.<br>  <br>  Dann wird geschrieben, dass Jesus sterblich war und deswegen nicht zurückkommen kann. Was war mit seiner Auferstehung? Wer aufersteht und gen Himmel f?hrt, kann ab und zu auch mal wieder "runterkommen"..<br>  <br>  Ich streite nicht die Existenz des Jesus ab, aber ich bezweifel, dass er Gottes Sohn war.<br>  <br>  Wer an Jesus und Gott glauben will und glaubt verdient meinen Respekt.

Und viele fühlen sich durch Erlebnisse, auch kleinen, in ihrem Glauben best?tigt.|`|Bi4OCxHKaa	Gab es nunJesus oder nicht? Es gab ihn.<br>  <br>  Jesus (Jeschuah Bar-Mirjam aus Nazareth in Galil?a) ist kurz vor Ende der Regierungszeit Herodes I. (37-4vC) als Sohn des "tekton" (= lat. faber = Handwerker, Bau-, Holzarbeiter) Joseph und seiner Frau Maria geboren und w?chst in Nazareth in Galil?a auf. Die Berufsbezeichnung des Vaters wird auch für Jesus verwendet. Wenn die Mk 6,3 genannten (Jakobus, Joses, Judas, Simon) seine leiblichen Brüder sind (wofür historisch alles spricht), so war er der ?lteste einer gro?en Geschwisterreihe. Nach dem relativ frühen Tod des Vaters versorgt er die Familie nach jüdischer Sohnespflicht durch Ausübung des ererbten Berufes (d.h auch: er kann in dieser Zeit nicht heiraten), bis er - von dieser Pflicht frei - zu Johannes dem T?ufer an den Jordan zieht. Nach der Taufe durch Johannes zieht er, alsbald zusammen mit einer Gruppe von M?nnern und Frauen ("Jüngern"), unter denen er zw?lf M?nner analog zu den zw?lf St?mmen Israels bzw. den S?hnen Jakobs besonders herausstellte,  durch Galil?a, vor allem die Orte am Nordwesten des Sees Genezareth (Kapernaum dürfte eine Art fester Aufenthaltsort gewesen sein, das auch "seine Stadt" genannt wird: Mt 4,13; 9,1). Dabei weicht er auch ins heidnische Nachbargebiet aus (C?sarea Philippi, die Gegend von Tyrus und Sidon, Dekapolis, das ?stliche Seeufer) und kommt zu Wallfahrtsfesten nach Jerusalem. Wie oft letzteres geschieht, d.h. wie lange Jesus ?ffentlich t?tig war, ist ungewi?; eher - wie nach Matth?us-Markus-Lukas - ein einziges Jahr, als - nach dem Johannes-Evangelium - drei bis vier Jahre. In besonderer Weise spricht Jesus dabei die Bettelarmen, die Z?llner (Kollaborateure mit der r?mischen Besatzungsmacht, die aus der religi?sen Gemeinschaft der Juden ausgeschlossen waren), die Sünder, die Kranken und Auss?tzigen an. Er führt durch seine Lehre und Praxis die Verlorenen Israels wieder zusammen und spricht ihnen k?nigliche Würde zu.<br>  Er hatte die elementare jüdische Bildung, die auch in dem armen Galil?a selbstverst?ndlich war. Ob in seiner Familie davidische Herkunftstraditionen überliefert waren - und evtl. eine darin begründete bzw. darauf ausgerichtete st?rkere religi?se Erziehung stattfand - ist ungewi?. Jedenfalls stand die Familie messianischen Aufbruchbewegungen nahe oder war mit Tr?gern solcher Bewegungen sogar verwandt (Johannes dem T?ufer). Im Laufe seines ?ffentlichen Wirkens predigte Jesus sowohl in Synagogen wie unter freiem Himmel und schlie?lich im Tempelvorhof von Jerusalem. Er wurde alsbald nicht nur von seinem engsten Anh?ngerkreis "Rabbi" (Meister, Lehrer) genannt (was damals noch ohne formale Ordination h?ufig vorkam).<br>  Wenn er sich in den 20er Jahren (des 1. Jh.) der Bewegung Johannes des T?ufers anschlo?, so trat er damit in das Umfeld einer radikal tempelkritischen und zugleich gegen die herrschende Obrigkeit gerichteten Bewegung (die nicht etwa ein Einzelph?nomen in Pal?stina war). Der T?ufer verkündigte seine Sündenvergebung angesichts des bevorstehenden Gottesgerichts v?llig abgel?st von den Sühnem?glichkeiten des Tempels in Jerusalem. Jesus versch?rft dies noch durch seine im Bewu?tsein der g?ttlichen Vollmacht, die ihm eigen ist, ausgesprochene Sündenvergebung jetzt und hier - statt am Jüngsten Tage durch Gott. Für diesen Zuspruch braucht Jesus weder Taufe noch ?hnliche Riten, nicht einmal ein Sündenbekenntnis; allenfalls antwortet er damit auf einen Schrei ("Sohn Davids, erbarme dich meiner!"). Zudem tritt bei Jesus neben das Motiv der endzeitlichen Sammlung und Vers?hnung Israels bereits die Erfüllung der Prophetie der V?lkerwallfahrt zum Zion (Jesaja, Micha), d.h. er bezieht stellenweise Nichtjuden in das umfassende und universale Liebesangebot Gottes ein.<br>  Er erregt durch sein Leben und seine ?ffentliche Lehre Aufmerksamkeit und Widerspruch in h?chstem Ma?e. Seine Familie m?chte ihn anfangs schützen, indem sie ihn für unzurechnungsf?hig erkl?ren lassen will (Mk 3,21). Nach seinem Tode geh?ren nicht nur seine Mutter, sondern auch seine Brüder und andere Verwandte zu seinen Anh?ngern - Ausnahmen davon sind nicht bekannt. Mit Pharis?ern verschiedener Gruppen (vom Land und "aus der Stadt" Jerusalem) diskutiert er mit jüdischer Sch?rfe über sein Programm; d.h. er würdigt sie des Disputs, da sie einander nahestehen. Zeloten nimmt er in Einzelf?llen in seine Jüngerschaft auf. Sadduz?ern und der ihnen nahestehende Tempelaristokratie verweigert er das Streitgespr?ch. In jeder Hinsicht bewegt sich Jesus im Horizont des damaligen (sehr vielf?ltigen) jüdischen Glaubenslebens.<br>  Als ?lteste Jesustradition erkennen wir: die Seligpreisungen der Armen, der Hungernden, der Weinenden (Lk 6,20f), den Kamelspruch (Mk 10,25), den Spruch von den Ersten und den Letzten (Mk 10,31; Mt 19,30 und 20,16; Lk 13,30), die Erz?hlung vom reichen Mann und armen Lazarus (Lk 16,19-26) sowie - in gewisser Weise - das Magnificat (Lk 1,46-54) und die überlieferungen, die Jesus als Freund der Z?llner und Sünder, als "Fresser und S?ufer" bezeichnen (Mt 11,19Q/Mk 2,15/Mt 21,31f), das Jesuswort bei der Tempelreinigung (Mt 21,13) und der Kern von Mk 2,23-27 (?hrenausraufen am Sabbat), das Vaterunser und wesentliche Teile der Bergpredigt.<br>  Jesus wirkt als Rabbi, der zugleich "messianischer Prophet" ist. Er hat das Bewu?tsein einer ganz unmittelbaren Verbindung zu Gott, den er famili?r "Abba" (V?terchen) nennt. Zugleich redet er ganz zentral vom "K?nigtum" Gottes (Reich Gottes, griech. basileia, hebr. "malkuth ha-schamaijjim"). Aus diesem doppelten Verst?ndnis bezieht Jesus sein Bewu?tsein einer messianischen Bevollm?chtigung. Den Titel "Messias" kann er nicht unmittelbar aufgreifen, da er im zeitgen?ssischen Judentum in vielerlei Variationen schillert. Er füllt ihn also gewisserma?en durch seine Praxis und seine Worte auf - und er widerspricht nicht direkt, als er vor Pilatus gefragt wird. In seiner Verkündigung spricht er oftmals von sich selbst als dem "Menschensohn", offensichtlich in Bezug zur Danielapokalypse (Dan 7,13). In jedem Falle war er anders "Messias" als es dieser Titel vor seinem Auftreten und Tod ausgesagt h?tte. Nicht etwa nur "die Juden" (die es so pauschal gar nicht gab), sondern sowohl seine Gegner wie seine ersten Jüngern und Anh?nger h?tten sich Messias-Sein anders vorgestellt - auch wenn die messianische Deutung von Jes 53 schon üblich ist. Sehr stark greift Jesus aber die jüdische Erwartung der "messianischen Zeit" und des "messianischen Kahal" (der zum Messias geh?renden Jüngergemeinschaft) auf. Stellenweise erwartet er von seinen berufenen Jüngern auch eine st?rker verdichtete Ethik des Gottesreiches als von den Menschen allgemein.<br>  Das entscheidende Ereignis seines Todes bahnt sich an, als er - vermutlich im Jahre 30 oder 33 nC - zur Passahwallfahrt nach Jerusalem kommt.In dieser Konfrontation mit "Jerusalem" erwartet Jesus offensicht eine entscheidende Wende, zu der sowohl ein eingreifendes Handeln Gottes wie zugleich ein m?glicher M?rtyrertod geh?ren kann. Im Hintergrund seiner Verhaftung in Gethsemane, die  zur Vollstreckung des Todesurteils führt, steht die Beunruhigung der Tempelaristokratie wegen der radikalen Tempelkritik (Austreibung der Wechsler und H?ndler) und ihre Angst vor einem antir?mischen Volksaufruhr zur Festzeit im Hintergrund. Formal befestigt wird dieser Argwohn aber durch die Anklage vor der r?mischen Milit?rbeh?rde, Jesus trete als jüdischer K?nigspr?tendent auf, der die Alleinherrschaft Roms gef?hrde. Eindeutig belegen sowohl die Kreuzesinschrift (INRI) wie vor allem der Kreuzestod selbst, dass die Verhandlung gegen Jesus in der Verantwortung durch die r?mische Milit?rmacht stand. (Kreuzigung ist eine rein r?mische Form der Todesstrafe; kein jüdisacher Gericht ist dazu berechtigt oder bevollm?chtigt.)<br>  Jesus ringt mit der Tatsache des bevorstehenden Todes und mit der für Juden sch?ndlichen Gestalt des Kreuzestodes. In dem "Mein Gott, mein Gott, warum hast du mich verlassen?" ist aber auch der weitere Wortlaut von Psalm 22 einbegriffen. Insofern schlie?en menschliche Verzagtheit (Bewu?tsein des Scheiterns) und Todesangst einerseits und Aufsichnehmen des Todes am Kreuz "für andere" andererseits sich nicht aus.<br>  Die Jünger fliehen angesichts des Todesurteils über Jesus; einige Frauen aus dem Jüngerkreis bleiben und stehen "von ferne" in Sichtweite des Kreuzes.<br>  Aus dem Kreis dieser Frauen, die auch am ersten Tag der Woche zum Grab Jesu gehen, ragt - wie schon zuvor in Galil?a - Maria von Magdala als erste Künderin der Auferstehung (?Apostolin der Apostel“) hervor. Andere Frauen sowie die Mutter Jesu geh?ren zu diesen ersten Zeugen, deren Worte Petrus, Johannes und die anderen Jünger dazu bewegen, sich an das leere Grab zu begeben. (Sp?ter tritt Petrus als formal zust?ndiger m?nnlicher Zeuge st?rker hervor als Maria Magdalena.)<br>  Die Botschaft von der Begegnung mit dem Auferstandenen greift auf die jüdisch-eschatologische Erwartung der Auferstehung der Toten zurück. In Verbindung mit der pfingstlichen Geisterfahrung wird sie zu dem gro?en, die Mission der Kirche initiierenden und begründenden Glaubenserlebnis, von dem die gl?ubige Christenheit bis heute getragen wird.<br>  Die Auferstehung selbst entzieht sich - ebenso wie das Glaubensbekenntnis zu Jesus als dem "Sohn Gottes" und Erl?ser - jeder historischen Analyse und damit auch jeder historischen Beweisführung pro wie contra. Es ist aber festzuhalten, da? die jüdische Auferstehungserwartung ebenso wie die apostolische Auferstehungsbotschaft und vor allem ihre Folgen (Glauben, Ausbreitung der Kirche) historische Tatbest?nde sind und da? die frühchristlichen Zeugen (bis hin zu Paulus) ihre Begegnungen mit dem Auferstandenen eindeutig von Tr?umen, Visionen, Auftreten eines Totengeistes, subjektiven Vorstellungen (Einbildungen) oder der Wiederkehr von Versstorbenen unterscheiden und absetzen.<br>  Der historische Befund widerspricht, sofern man geschichtliche Plausibilit?t im gro?en und ganzen in das Nachzeichnen der Jesusgeschichte einbezieht, in gar keiner Weise der doxologischen Proklamation, mit der die Kirche in Liturgie und Gebet sowie in den altkirchlichen dogmatischen Bekenntnissen (der Konzilien) von Jesus, dem Messias, ihrem "Kyrios" spricht, der in ganzer Niedrigkeit ("bis zum Tode am Kreuz") Mensch wurde und zugleich als der "einziggeborene Sohn" die ewige Herrlichkeit Gottes offenbart ("Wer mich sieht, sieht den Vater", Joh  14,9)|`|d9e03544880f6c3ce906def42351fdb8aa	Ich m?chte zu den Ausführungen meines Vorredners noch hinzufügen, dass manches, was Jesus zugeschrieben wurde, letztlich Mythen waren, bzw. aus verschiedenen Elementen von sp?teren Bibelautoren zusammengesetzt wurde.

Das wird sowohl von zeitgenoessischen juedischen als auch roemischen Schreibern berichtet, weshalb es als gesichert angesehen werden kann.<br>  Ob es den kerygmatischen Jesus (kerygma=griechisch Verkuendigung) gab, der Wunder gewirkt hat und auferstanden ist, weil er als Sohn Gottes die Macht dazu hatte - das muss man im Glauben selbst entscheiden!

Weniger in dem Sinne, dass der Mensch nicht von sich aus "gut" sein kann.<br>  2. Ja das tut er. Aber das reicht nicht. Der Mensch an sich ist so gut wie immer Egoist - und wenn nicht im Handeln, dann doch in den Motiven (wenn er ehrlich zu sich selbst ist).<br>  3. Weil Christus uns zum einen trotz unserer Fehlerhaftigkeit den Weg zu Gott freigemacht hat und wir uns nichts mehr verdienen müssen und k?nnen.<br>  4. Ja, es HAT Sinn. Mehr als alles andere.<br>  <br>  Nachtrag: Was das Christsein von allen anderen Glaubensrichtungen (es ist n?mlich keine "Religion") unterscheidet, ist die Einzigartigkeit des "Liebe-Gnade-Modells". Nirgendwo sonst hat GOTT alles N?tige getan - nirgendwo sonst muss und kann man sich den Himmel nicht verdienen.<br>  Christus ist deswegen nicht austauschbar, weil er eine Person ist, die mit uns Beziehung lebt (so wir denn wollen).

Der Buddhist ist also aus selbstgef?lligen Gründen gut (einem guten Menschen widerf?hrt etwas Gutes), der Christ, weil er Angst hat vor dem Sch?pfer zur Rechenschaft gezogen zu werden.<br>  Es ist egal, wem du folgst, solange es gut ist. Und nebenbei, Buddha lebte ein halbes Jahrtausend vor Christus und ist also weniger "modern" als es Jesus ist. Nebenbei ist Jesus sehr "popul?r", weil seine Leidensgeschichte viel emotionsgeladener ist als die vieler anderen Religionen. Das macht diese Person und den christlichen Glauben sehr eindrucksvoll. <br>  Ich finde nur den Buddhismus intelligenter, weil er nicht lehrt, das etwas anderes falsch sei, sondern Toleranz und Mitgefühl allen gilt.|`|bWuo8K0Vaa	Alle religonen sind ja sehr aehnlich ich finde ich kann nicht schlechtes an den Budismus oder an dem Christentum erkennen.

Darwin brought in a beer keg, and while his men were getting drunk he combined the bones together, stained them with chromic acid and an iron solution to simulate old age and tossed it into the pit and covered it up with dirt and rocks. Then when they wanted to do the carbon dating he smashed up some rocks and said they were fossilized bones from the skull and it made it look like it was millions of years old. Finally Darwin was able to get his research grants approved with this proof of a missing link. It was so successful that Darwin did the same things with Nebraska Man, Java Man, Ocre Man, and Neanderthals by mixing skulls of primates and other animals, as long as he smashed up rocks that were millions of years old, and call them fossil fragments he was able to fool the carbon dating tests. This set the standard for modern Evolutionary Scientists who now use particle accelerators to age fossils that they created out of clay to resemble real fossils, and the radiation speeds up the half-life of carbon atoms so they look like they are really old. Then just discredit other theories as pseudo-science, and launch smear campaigns against the scientists who support other theories to discredit and disprove them. In between doing all of this Darwin was busy sucking the dick of many primates as a way to relax and get in tune with nature. Modern Evolutionists do the same thing, although some of them prefer to get sodomized in the anus by wild baboons instead.
AA10929952	Very good question and right place to shoot. I have doubt whether you will get right answer but I will try to give an outsider view.<br>  <br>  I am a rich man today. Just twenty years back, I had few hundred rupees in my pocket. Today, I have lacs.<br>  <br>  Your both arguments are correct. <br>  <br>  USA is rich because people waste so much. If people do not spend money lavishly no country or society can grow economically. It is a simple law of economics being taught by developed country to the world. Consumer spending power is directly proportional to country growth. Rich people must spend a lot. When as a human you spend, decisions on right thing remain difficult. Waste has to be the part of the whole system. <br>  <br>  Second statement is also true. You waste so much because you are rich.Only rich can afford to waste. Poor people or starved nation can never waste, because they do not have it. Waste is a very natural process. If you see every human or living being on this earth starts day with lot of waste. The quantity of waste is again directly proportional to the richness of individual. So this stands logic.<br>  <br>  Enjoy with all your waste. But only thing to be cautious is to have proper waste management so that it does not create problem for earth.|`|22870b9fa74667f35d8c85caa8621251aa	because you are greedy, do not give charity, take from others and this make you able to save|`|AA12116844	When you are rich, you will have different priorities of life, food and shelter will be taken for granted, lots of upgrading in the quality of life there will be great waste of materials and food.<br>  <br>  When you are poor, every grain counts, every scrap of junk can be used to construct a shelter. <br>  <br>  There are many poor people still in the US but still to a comfortable level compared to the thrid world.<br>  <br>  My conclusion, USA is rich enough to afford high wastage.|`|e177612658f5405a12bbe253aab12df5aa	usa isnt rich by a stretch were so far in debt its ridiculous

ZGYlyqQvaa	L'islam distingue deux types de prophètes, les prophètes envoyés et les prophètes inspirés (nabis) qui sont beaucoup plus nombreux (ils seraient 124.000 d'après la tradition). <br>  <br>  Mahomet est bien s?r le plus important des prophètes puisque c'est lui que Allah a choisi pour transmettre le Coran, mais il n'est pas le seul prophète de l'Islam.

Ceux qui croient et qui ne revêtent point leur foi de l'injustice, ceux-là jouiront de la sécurité ; ceux-là sont sur le chemin droit.<br>  83. Tels sont les arguments de l'unité de Dieu que nous fourn?mes à Abraham contre son peuple. Nous élevons ceux qu'il nous pla?t. Ton Seigneur est sage et savant.<br>  84. Nous lui donnames Isaac et Jacob, et nous les avons tous deux. Antérieurement nous avons déjà dirigé Noé. Parmi les descendants d'Abraham nous dirigeames aussi David et Salomon, et Job et Joseph, et Mo?se et Aaron. C'est ainsi que nous récompensons ceux qui font le bien.<br>  85. Zacharie, Yahia (Jean), Jésus et Elie, tous, ils étaient justes.<br>  86. Isma?l, Elisée, Jonas et Loth, nous les avons élevés au-dessus de tous les êtres créés.<br>  87. De même, parmi leurs pères et leurs enfants, parmi leurs frères, nous en avons élu un grand nombre et les avons conduits dans le chemin droit.<br>  <br>  Tous les prophètes musulmans avant Mahomet sont évoqués dans la Bible. <br>  <br>  Pour les musulmans, Mahomet est le dernier des prophètes, il est le "sceau des prophètes".<br>  <br>  Jésus, un prophète musulman<br>  Jésus est le plus important prophète après Mahomet. L'Islam reconna?t l'immaculée conception mais ne reconna?t pas en Jésus le Fils de Dieu. La mère de Jésus est également très importante pour les musulmans, d'ailleurs elle est la seule femme dont le nom est cité dans le Coran.|`|7IoU7tYHaa	je ne connais pas désolé je crois qu'ils sont mort !!!!!!|`|Xqu3682haa	il y a exactement 352 prophètes<br>  et plus de 300 000 messagers<br>  le premier prophète est Adam<br>  le dernier est Mohamed "saaw"|`|xRaGyugTaa	jesus , mohamed sala lahou alayhi , salah , moise , ibrahim , chouaibe .................|`|1vKaFVuDaa	De mémoire (je joue le jeu sans moteur de recherche ni regarder des bouquins):<br>  Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Mo?se, Josué, Samuel, David, Salomon<br>  Isa?e, Jérémie, Baruch, Daniel, Ezékiel, Zacharie, Nahum, Jonas, Michée, Habaquq, Abdias, Jo?l, Malachie<br>  Elie, Hulda (prophétesse)<br>  Jean le Baptiste, Jésus<br>  Mohammed<br>  Zarathoustra<br>  Siddartha (Bouddha)<br>  Je suis un peu fatigué, ma mémoire fait défaut|`|37109e48291b8595bb8bb40afdb514e1aa	jérémie <br>  Ezéchiel  <br>  Daniel  <br>  Osée  <br>  Jo?l  <br>  Amos  <br>  Abdias  <br>  Jonas  <br>  Michée  <br>  Nahum  <br>  Habacuc  <br>  Sophonie  <br>  Aggée  <br>  Zacharie  <br>  Malachie|`|bb447d298156dfcc043d21616d5b2c76aa	nous sommes tous prophètes|`|d93cc96110b28b55f2d0e0047588416aaa	jesus.mohamed(s) .isàak.joseph.jacob..elias..ayoub.....et plein d'autres|`|dae1c65184018bdc6425b4a10ccd4bdbaa	J'ai l'impression que les prophètes prennent une place qui ne revient pas et dont ils n'auraient pas voulu de leur vivant.|`|f3428ab5e18f11c27b17d4e281a07008aa	Ben tiens ils sont beaux les prophètes.|`|f6b641c666b4fcf5fee0f2c8ebfc48f1aa	jesus mahomet moise|`|leT0Cc51aa	Moise, abram, Josué etc<br>  Jésus, après vient les faux prophètes<br>  bien qu'avant Jésus, il y avait aussi de faux<br>  c'est la Bible qui le dit<br>  donc un faux prophète qui travaille pour le diable qui est le père du mensonge<br>  va faire mentir Dieu , il a tout intérêt<br>  si il vient après de dire que la Bible a été falsifiée<br>  comme si Dieu pouvait pas garder sa parole<br>  <br>  amen|`|1vZKW9xIaa	salut à toi  il y a eu plusieurs prophète de adam à noés<br>  <br>  voici ceux que je connait le premier adam_idriss_noé_hud_salih_loth_abraham_i... le fiils d'abraham_jacob_joseph_chu'ayb_job_ du'l-kifl_moise,et,aaron_david_salomon_e... , et , elisée_jonas_zacharie et jean baptiste_jésus fils de marie_le dernier mohammed paie et salut à tous les prophète de l'islam|`|Xx92cUjiaa	mohamed,jésus,moise,abrham,ismaeil,yousè... y en a de 1000lié.|`|llAFW8Xzaa	yen a bcp vu ke je suis musulman ! ya mohamed iisa mousa nouh ibrahim ...|`|fnfg5q63aa	- Matsya. <br>  - Kurma<br>  - Varaha<br>  - Narasimha<br>  - Vamana<br>  - Parashurama<br>  - Ramachandra<br>  - Krishna <br>  - Indra<br>  - Varuna<br>  - ma?tre Kong<br>  - Lao Tseu<br>  - Siddhartha Gautama Shakyamouni<br>  - Ramanuja<br>  - Zarathoustra<br>  - Jésus<br>  - Nagarjuna (le deuxième bouddha)<br>  - Vasubandhu<br>  - Mani<br>  - Mohammed<br>  - Asanga<br>  - Dharmakirti<br>  - Chandrakirti<br>  - Dignaga<br>  - Padmasambhava<br>  - Sri Shankaracharya<br>  - Lama Je Tsongkhapa<br>  - Sri Ramakrishna<br>  - Ma Ananda Mayi<br>  - Kabir<br>  - Surdas<br>  - Mirabai<br>  - Ramana Maharishi<br>  <br>  et j'en oublie sans doute un grand nombre|`|99dc54285ff2056fb9997c88a16f3caaaa	Ce n'est pas une question, c'est un ordre !

No. Not all men are so obsessed with sexuality that they have porn on their computers. Men in general don't just walk around thinking about sex 24/7. Neither do women. Generally if they do there is a problem.<br>  This behavior is indicative of pedafiles and molesters. Some guys enjoy looking on occasion but they have it set up where their significant other will not find it. It is not in open view unless.... he lives alone and doesn't care. There are Christian men.. Fathers.. Business men.. Entertainers... and many others who are curious. That doesn't necessarily mean they have or have had porn on their computers though.|`|3258b0d138f1fd6d0fa97770247cade2aa	Yes,it is normal.|`|ca016b7b2afefe660b431a14cef4e910aa	NORMAL!!!!men AND women do it!!who don't like to peek at hot stuff anonymously????My husband and i both check it out.|`|y8Kzqx6kaa	Not quite, is at least 60-70%.

Z0aaEDSTaa	Yo tambien soy hombre.  Dicen las que saben de orgasmo femenino (como mi esposa), que es la cosa más grandiosa que puede suceder. Que empieza como una sensacion de pesadez en el clítoris, luego sigue por toda la vagina, y poco a poco va controlando todo el cuerpo. Que es casi como el estornudo mas delicioso que existe, guardando las distancias del caso en esta comparación. Que poco a poco esa pesadez se va haciendo mas grande, y mas grande, y mas grande haste que de un momento a otro se convierte en un vertigo alucinante que la hace sentir totalmente liviana, con una sensación de voluptuosidad en los genitales que deseas que nunca acabe, que la hace sentir maravillosas cosquillas, vertigo, somnolencia, en fin, que es lo más rico que pueda sentir dentro de su cuerpo y que al final siente que vas a estallar de placer, pero sin dejar de sentir dentro de su cuerpo la grandiosidad del orgasmo. <br>  Para provocar un orgasmo sabroso. el hombre tiene que ser instruido lo suficiente para poder ser paciente, complaciente, generoso y eficaz, y pueda trabajar a la mujer con cari?o, mimos, caricias, palabras lindas y sobre todo, saber donde y cuando hacerlo para que disfrute del viaje a la luna mas increible que existe. <br>  Te lo dice un viejo que disfruta con su esposa de orgasmos increibles despues de muchos a?os de matrimonio. Ah... esa es otra, los orgasmos que provoca la persona amada son definitivamente EXTREMOS!!!<br>  Que opinas?<br>  Zadkiel|`|A5YG1T9gaa	Ya lo has experimentado?  Pues es indescriptible.

Y digo que no interviene la voluntad porque se produce espontáneamente ocurriendo en cualquier momento del acto y también puede suceder durante un sue?o o la observación de alguna escena erótica..|`|gwwqOGV8aa	Creo que de la unica forma que podria describirlo es diciendo: es como morir y renacer al mismo tiempo.

eCsSDRHWaa	@ Mounira <br>  C'est quoi ces arguments balancés au hasard ?<br>  C'est pas les amish, mais les mormons.<br>  D'autres part, c'est pas les évangélistes mais les évangéliques et ?a m'étonnerait qu'ils soient polygames, a moins que tu parles de sectes minoritaires. (je suis moi-même évangélique)<br>  <br>  D'autre part, le voile des bonnes soeur n'a rien à voir avec le voile islamique, puisque le voile islamique est obligatoire. Le fait d'être bonne soeur est un engagement personnel.<br>  <br>  @ chocho<br>  Apparemment tu ne sais pas pourquoi les archeveqeques ne se marient pas. Ca n'a rien à voir avec la Bible et d'ailleurs les pasteurs protestants se marient. Alors que le voile islamique est décrit dans le coran.|`|5ae80228f5c8f59cb10a3a96e703cc23aa	Tout d'abord, une musulmane se voile parceque Dieu lui commande de le faire. Il y a un verset dans le Qur'an qui dit de dire aux femmes des croyants de placer leur khimar au dessus de leur poitrine  (ce mot fait alusion au voile que portaient les femmes DéJá a l'époque sur leur tete). Il faut bien comprendre que ce genre de commandement, étant celui de Dieu, est tout comme Ses mots, universel et éternel. Ni la place ni l'heure n'importent. <br>  Le voile est aussi une facon pour que les pieuses se fassent reconnaitre dans société, pour que les gens sachent a partir de leur tenue vestimentaire (ainsi que les hommes qui laissent pousser leur barbe et s'habillent aussi modestement) qu'elles appartiennent aux croyants. <br>  Le voile (hijab) est autant un vetement qu'une attitude. Il faut garder sa pudeur, essayer de faire de son mieu pour adhérer aux qualités d'un bon croyant, comme la patience, la rigeur, le savoir,  aider les gens dans le besoin etc.<br>  Quand de nos jours les gens sont jugés pour les marques de leur jeans, le prix de leur montre ou la rondeur de leur fesses, ca donne une sorte de pouvoir que d'avoir le choix de montrer son corps a celui qui le mérite (son mari) et a ceux qui connaissent la personalité et les qualités de cette femme. <br>  La femme voilée revendique son droit d'etre un etre humain qui doit etre jugée pour ce qu'elle a a dire et non pas pour son tour de poitrine. C'est pas une blague ce que je dis.<br>  <br>  Les hommes qui ont des épouses voilées sont tres fieres d'aimer une femme qui revendique son droit et qui le fait par amour envers Dieu, c'est pas compliqué tout ca, meme tres beau. En plus dans une société oú les muslumans sont regardé d'un drole d'oeil, c'est plus dur, mais la recompense sera doublée si Dieu le veut.<br>  <br>  La polygamie est permie dans l'islam sous de strictes conditions et c'est pour ca qu'elle se fait rare. <br>  <br>  Les femmes: 3. <br>  "Et si vous craignez de n'être pas justes envers les orphelins,il est permis d'épouser deux, trois ou quatre, parmi les femmes qui vous plaisent, mais, si vous craignez de n'être pas justes avec celles-ci, alors une seule, ou des esclaves que vous possédez. Cela afin de ne pas faire d'injustice (ou afin de ne pas aggraver votre charge de famille)."<br>  <br>  Les Femmes :129 ? Vous ne pouvez pas être équitable dans une relation polygame, vous avez beau essayer. ?<br>  <br>  Le verset sur la polygamie fut revelé parcequ'il se trouvait qu'il y avait beaucoup de femmes veuves et avec des enfants qui n'avaient plus rien apres une bataille. Vous avez une meilleur solution pour elles quand le nombre d'hommes dans une société dimunue autant?<br>  Il ne faut pas oublier que le verset qui suit montre bien qu'un homme aura beaucoup de difficulté sinon de traiter équitablement plus d'une femme donc ceci lui est déconseillé. Personellement, je suis 4 femmes a moi toute seule lol, non mais je veux dire que je pense que pour une homme, une femme est assez de boulot comme ca : ) Et puis le jour du Jugement il faudra qu'il rende ses comptes devant Dieu alors attention...!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bonne journée!|`|8Kg5T9hWaa	La religion musulmane est-elle la seule ou des femmes se voilent ?<br>  <br>  Pourquoi les bonnes soeurs catholiques sont-elles respectées et admirées pour leur spiritualité (cu que je trouve bien, que ?a soit clair) tandis que les femmes musulmanes qui ont choisi de porter le foulard sont sans cesse indexées et regardées avec mépris pour leurs choix spirituels ?|`|OoBIOT9Paa	Personnellement, je suis de mère musulmane et d un père reconverti à l Islam mais je ne connais pas vraiment  la religion mais je peux te dire que la polygamie est très rare de nos jours en tout cas en France et elle est même interdite dans certains pays arabes comme la Tunisie, pour le voile ce serait parait il pour protéger la femme, certains me disent qu il n est pas obigatoire dans la religion musulmane d autres disent le contraire, moi je pense que le port du voile est complètement inadaptée à notre époque et surtout en France et ?a me fait de la peine quand je vois des gens qui revendiquent absolument le port du voile en France et que des femmes se sont battues en Algérie pour ne plus être obligées de le porter.Mais si tu as le temps documente toi et tu verras que c est malgré ces 2 points une très belle religion avec un message de tolérance, de pardon et de paix malgré ce que les extrémistes veulent nous croire ...|`|s762Ycg4aa	je préfère la polygamie que le fait qu'un homme trempe sa femme,car chez nous les musulman si l'homme trempe sa femme ,alors sa femme deviens harame pour lui ,il lui est interdit de touché a ?a femme donc vous voyez pourquoi dieu a rendu illicite la polygamie <br>  en plus comme je lé dit plusieurs fois on est 1 homme pour 5 femme je crois donc ce nombre va grimper<br>  pour le voile ne dite pa n'imporet quoi svp ,il est obligatoire il est ecrit dans le coran|`|fnfg5q63aa	c'est bien entendu totalement en contradiction avec les lois de la république.<br>  Il est anormal que la loi ne soit pas appliquée...<br>  <br>  Espérons que dans les mois à venir notre gouvernement décide enfin de faire appliquer toutes les lois de la république avec rigueur..|`|2b27c4496c4784176510cc9ec0ab88abaa	Le voile n'est pas une obligation mais seulement une interprétation...en plus il est porté pour protéger les hommes du péché (discour de Tariq Ramadan).;je sais pas pour vous mais moi des cheveux ne m'ont jamais éxités !!!!|`|5a4b1e5f8f05d02c6f8b46d26c6a79ccaa	euh la femme voilée, c'est dépassé, regardes il existe des bonnes soeurs qui sont voilées, et pourtant elles ne sont pas musulmanes. Et la polygamie, comme le voile, ne sont plus suivies, par la majorité des musulmans aujourd'hui. Moi en tout cas mon mari n'a qu'une femme.<br>  <br>  (les amish, et certains évangélistes SONT polygames. Réveilles toi.....)|`|994c504bab4fc949b214cf414e709a52aa	Je n suis pas musulmane, ma connaissance de ce texte est tres limitée. Maintenant j'ai un peu cherché, ce que signifiait cette histoire de voile!<br>  Et j'en ai conclu deux choses:<br>  1/ le fait que les femmes aient à être voilée depend de la comprehension du texte... Certaines interpretations disent qu'elles doivent juste couvrir leurs attrait, de couvrir leur poitrine (= faire preuve de pudeur). D'autres qu'elles doivent se couvrir tout court (= voile). Le voile complet depend aussi d'une interpretation: les femmes concernées sont elles celles du prophete ou les femmes en generales... bref, tout depend de l'interpretation. <br>  2/ Qu'il faut revoir les choses dans leur contexte. Au moment où le Coran a été ecrit, les femmes n'avaient aucun droit. La polygamie existait à fond, les femmes etaient repudiées dans raison, jetées à la rue et contraintes à la prostitution, donc à l'exhibitionnisme, pour survivre. Les femmes mariées restaient à la maison et ne sortaient pas.<br>  Dans ce contexte, le Coran a fait enormement pour le droit des femmes. Il leur a donné la dignité, un mot à dire, un statut, des droits, la possibilité de sortir sans être agressée... en celà il les a enormement protegées.<br>  Maintenant, la situation ayant changé, on y voit plutot des regressions, mais à l'origine ce sont de grands progres... Le probleme avec le Coran, c'est que les ecrits ont été dictés par Dieu lui même et ne peuvent donc pas évoluer... la seule chose qui evolue, ce sont les interpretations...<br>  Quand au fait que les choses doivent être interpretées, qu'elles n'y soient pas dites explicitement, c'est le propre de toutes les religions...|`|a4cbe0af078feafd3b84b60d06dbc3a4aa	avant en france les femmes se voiler la tete puis portaient des chapeaux mais les musulmanes que je connais ne portent pas le voile, alors qu'elles sont pratiquantes, leur mère elles portaient le voile, c'est culturel<br>  après pour la polygamie cest principalement des femmes africaines qui en font les frais pas seulement musulmanes d'ailleurs animistes et chrétiennes aussi. <br>  je ne sais pas ce qu'en pense les musulmanes maghrébines, tiens je leur poserais la question|`|rwUREDe3aa	Nous non plus, mais ca n'a aucune importance. Vote Sarko, il va t'expliquer.|`|20cb9585f390234a7fd6b3a59f5edb09aa	c'est vrai que souvent la religion musulman est mal comprise meme dans les pratiquants.ce qui se termine par un non respect de la vie de la femme.j'ai dit souvent.j'ai pas dit tout les musulmans.tout comme il y a certain débordement dans les autres religions.mais disons que nous faisons plus attention à la religion musulmane car elle fait partie de la france maintenant ,ou du moinscommence a en faire partie.et je ne comprend pas ce que viennent faire les bonnes soeur dans l'histoire.?a n'a absolument aucun rapport.les soeurs sont entrées dans un ordre.les femmes musulmanes sont des citoyennes.|`|30osOw14aa	Contrairement à ce que beaucoup pensent, la femme est "cachée" comme tu dis pour être protégée. Qui mieux que Dieu sait comment sont fait les hommes?!<br>  <br>  Le voile à été demandé par la Bible "Que les femmes se voilent et que si elles ne veulent pas le faire alors qu'elles se rasent le crane. Mais si cela est une honte pour elles d'avoir le crane rasé, qu'elles portent le voile" . Jusque là, c'était par soumission à la volonté des hommes. Dans le Coran, Dieu demande au femme de continuer à le porter.<br>  <br>  Un homme qui sort avec sa femme voilée n'est PAS honteux d'elle, au contraire, il est très fier d'elle! C'est un trésor pour lui qu'il faut préserver. Je remarque que les non-musulmans ont très difficile à saisir ce concept...<br>  <br>  Il faut rajouter que le port du voile n'est pas un emblème politique, une mode ni même une coutume! Si il est porté par obligation, son sens religieux se perd. Mais les femmes qui sont obligées de le porter ne sont qu'une petite partie d'entre-elles.<br>  <br>  Pour ce qui est de la polygamie: Lorsque la religion Islamique est née, la polygamie existait et en exagération! L'Islam de la pas abrogé mais l'a limité. Il est même difficile d'être un bon musulman lorsqu'on est polygame car Dieu demande d'être équitable envers les femmes que l'homme épouse (ne pas chérir une qu'on aimerait plus que l'autre par exemple) et que c'est une chose extrêmement difficile. De plus, lors du contrat de mariage musulman, la femme peut tout à fait stipuler qu'elle ne souhaite pas que son mari ait d'autres femmes et ce dernier, se devra de respecter le contrat. C'est d'ailleur ce que le prophète (PSSL) a fait stipuler lors du mariage de sa fille afin qu'elle ne souffre pas d'une éventuelle injustice.<br>  <br>  Pour ma part, c'était bien clair entre mon mari et moi que c'était hors de question. Donc, la question ne se pose pas.<br>  Ha, et que je n'oublie pas de te dire: les épouses doivent avoir leurs propres appartements. Ils peuvent être dans la même maison mais séparés distinctement. Donc, inutile d'avoir plusieurs épouses et de dormir tous ensemble!<br>  <br>  Lorsque l'on arrive, un temps soit peu, à essayer de comprendre le pourquoi du comment, tout devient très simple, crois-moi...<br>  <br>  En espérant avoir un peu éclairci les idées noires que tu t'imaginais.|`|5nEM9A6uaa	C'est un commandement de Dieu, comme la Vierge Marie, les musulmanes s'y conforment!|`|IJocNAQYaa	Je laisse la parole aux femmes musulmanes pour te répondre.<br>  Dieu merci, elles sont à la hauteur !!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|RkF0EsQmaa	que preferes tu? : que ta femme soit voilée ou violée?|`|UmpiQY9Caa	le port du voile est une prescription religieuse, c'est aussi un choix vestimentaire en accord avec le foi, et qui permet à une femme musulmane qui a décidé de le porter, son choix de ne pas montrer ses charmes à tout le monde.<br>  <br>  La polygamie a certaines conditions :<br>  - faire preuve d'équité <br>  - avoir l'accord de son épouse<br>  - ne pas chercher à avoir des épouses parce qu'elles vous plaisent, ou pour des raisons "purement" perverses <br>  - avoir les moyens de subvenir à leur besoin <br>  si ceci n'est pas rempli une seule suffit comme c'est le c'est pour la plupart des musulmans.<br>  <br>  quant à l'excision et le mariage forcé ils n'ont rien à voir avec l'Islam|`|cGKNmuV5aa	La femme en islam, la polygamie etc..cette page y répond clairement, si tu ne comprends pas, je te répondrais.<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-fraternet.com/femme.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-fraternet.com/femme.htm</a>|`|xRaGyugTaa	moi je suis musulman et je t assure que ma religion est vraiment pleins d amour et de pays avec des règles  comme porter le hidjab
EoDeSDnmaa	I believe rap has absolutely no social redeeming value at all. It panders to the least common denominator in people. Rap has sent the women's equality movement back a 100 years,desensitized our youth to filthy and vulgar language and led many into believing that violence is acceptable behavior. Its a shame many of our teens look up to the rappers instead of people like Colin Powell,Clarence Thomas, and countless other positive role models.|`|xEt2x4R1aa	the lyrics are.

There will always be music that isn't to your liking or is just not grade a material. Don't judge a genre by a few songs. Rap is a musical form of poetry. It's a way for people to express themselves. So to say rap is crap is to say freedom of expression is crap. If you don't like the song, change the station.

What is sad is that these complications can be prevented. The problem is that many people do not have access to health care. Publicly funded clinics supposedly for poor people WILL turn people away if they cannot pay. They are not supposed to, but they do all the time. Sometimes people cannot afford the food and supplies needed for self-care. Small stores in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods often do not offer low fat or sugar free foods. We need a better health care system.|`|e23f4d1ba94f320e86e52a117ab0427faa	I'm guessing that you've lived in a first world country all your life.  Most third world countries, don't have any equivalent to medicaid.  There is no social welfare net to protect them.  Medical care is expensive, when you make less than $1 a day.  These areas are often war torn areas, with unexploded ordinance lying about.  A small wound becomes infected and because of lack of medical care the whole leg must be amputated.  Poor nutrition while a woman is pregnant, or drug and alcohol use, can produce birth defects.  I could go of indefinitely.<br>  <br>  I don't know how old you are, but if you're old enough to get out on your own, travel to another country, and get a broader idea of what is going on.  Most people in the USA never leave it, that leaves them very shortsighted when it comes to world issues.

ac6fdfe97aa4555bd44a607d64c03df4aa	In Islam we do have the death penalty, as well as other forms of punishment, and we do carry out these punishments whenever they are needed. We make no apologies for doing so, however, it is imperative to understand that we do have a justice system complete with courts and juries. These laws and punishments are for both our personal as well as the community's benefit. When carried out as intended, a truly Islamic State will rarely witness a repeat offender, which not only ensures the peace and harmony of the community by stopping potential tragedies, but also saves that community billions of tax dollars. Think of these laws as preventative measures. If you know that if you murder a person, you too will die, this makes that person think twice. in America, if you murder a person, you get a gauranteed place of residence, an excercise yard, AND access to a library. The actual punishment of execution may not come for eight to twelve years if at all. Besides the billions of dollars that law abiding citizens must shell out to provide these comforts (comforts that millions in the world will never know) where's the incentive NOT to commit a crime? Recidivism (repeat offenders) show that America's penal system does not work. In fact, America is the number one murder capitol in the ENTIRE WORLD, but you won't find that on the tourist brochures. Many Christians, but not all, will cry out that this is unjust and barbaric<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  After all, this is the message of the All-Wise and all-knowing God whose wisdom and knowledge are far beyond the ultimate in human thought and progress.|`|e3b5fb4c3b0b1f53173bf382245aab25aa	There is no mercy in Shariah Law.|`|1fed4a470ce857eb2b8ac16ef8dd4db2aa	Haha no you'll get beheaded real fast.

AA11173807	Lesbians and bisexual girls are better tolerated than gay men because of the roles that society gives to each gender. Social rules for a straight relationship dictate that women are supposed to be passionate, emotional, sensual, while men are supposed to be strong, bold and powerful. In a lesbian relationship women remain sensual and passionate. Where as in gay relationships society believes that the men have lost there strength and power by giving it to a man just as a women would be expected to do in a straight relationship.|`|e66c71f0c50e7672789a78265879bdc5aa	Well, it doesn't always happen like that.  I lost two jobs for being an openly bi woman, and my lesbian wife got bashed on the street.  Our sisters get discriminated against in marriage laws, the military, religion, employment, etc.  Sometimes two-woman couples get stared at like they're a wet dream come to life, or otherwise objectified.  So I can see where you're coming from, but if you get closer to the experience, you'll find it's not any easier for one gender than another.  LGBT women and men just have somewhat different challenges sometimes.|`|AA10293793	here's my take on this (i have asked that question myself many times). I'll make a few operational generalizations. please take them to mean "most of the time" not always and not everyone. also, this is my opinion, not a statement of fact.<br>  <br>  <br>  sex is generally not a big issue for women - by which i mean, we don't usually spend every leisure moment thinking about it. women tend to see it as a more private thing, they think of sex mostly as it relates to themselves and whoever they're involved with.<br>  for men, it's a different story. there are even some statistics that show men think about sex every 5 minutes! men see anything sexual as an issue. even things that are really none of their business. and since the women are worried about other things, men end up being the "authorities".<br>  <br>  now, here comes the main point:<br>  most men are homophobic. even many of the ones who think they're not will say "i say you can't hold it against them, but you have to admit it's not normal", or things to that effect.  I've spoken to men who are accepting of gay love, as long as it doesn't involve sex. how's that for ridiculous? I don't know why... maybe just because they were brought up to know about being "men".  therefore they say gay couples and their skin just crawls, because they see in gay people all the things they were taught to find grosse.<br>  however, i have been told (by men) that every straight man alive fantasizes about having sex with more than one woman. hence, when they look at lesbians and bisexual girls, what they see is their fantasy. they'd love to get into the bedroom with them and join in.|`|DsfYdl36aa	I agree with Jayelle because she points out that a lot of guys (my self, also, to my shame) would or have in the past, looked at two gay girls and objectified them. Of course, that is wrong, and I can only assume some chemical or hormone on my body is the culprit.<br>  <br>  I would bet most Lesbians, Gays, Transgendered folks, and bi-sexual would want to live in relative peace and anonymity, like the rest of us. But! If I see two hot girls making out on the dance floor, I know they are exhibitionists, probably, or really passionate. Either way...|`|UJkGrLXYaa	I think that lesbian and bisexual girls are only better tolerated than gay guys if they are hot. Older, butch women are not tolerated nearly as well as teenage lipsticks... probably has something to do with guys thinking they might have a chance to join in on a 3-some. However, in a lot of ways gay guys are more tolerated--for example, there have been more tv shows featuring gay men than gay women.|`|acdbdebb3cdc310232197bb9df8ff76faa	b/c that's just the way it is and we're not gonna change it!|`|f132cbb00041baab410a089ee4cd5544aa	Because nearly every straight male has the fantasy of himself in a lesbian threesome.  Or he thinks that their problem is that they just haven't had the right manlovin' and he can "convert" them.<br>  <br>  And without question, they're pleasant fantasies.  ;-)<br>  <br>  Don't you have them?|`|1RhGMbHraa	Well I dunno but I think its because of two possible reasons (the only 2 that come up to my mind):<br>  <br>  1-You can't really differentiate a straight girl holding her friend's hand form a lesbian girl holding her lover's hand. Girls are socially accepted to be hugging and stuff like that, since women represent tenderness and males have to represent the strong part.<br>  <br>  2- Women are more commercial than men. Haven't you noticed how many commercials have an almost naked woman depicted just to promote a product. An in porn..I read that lesbian porn is more popular than gay porn.<br>  <br>  But that's just my point of view o.o|`|AA11323392	as long as you don't resent homosexual men.... I'm a gay woman, and I don't have a problem with straight men enjoying lesbian fantasies if they also respect gay men. It's the ones who think they're being open-minded about lesbians but who are disgusted by gay men that I find scary.|`|AOutT1Ebaa	I feel lesbian girls are better tolerated by society because girls are the feminine sex, and girls being with girls is very feminine. Men can understand a women loving another women because men understand what attracts her to women.<br>  I also think most men have a fantasy about two women together.

Enfin, comme je venais de lire l'ancien testament (qui n'est pas mal non plus dans le genre) ?a ne m'a pas empêcher de me convertir...<br>  <br>  Je pense que si Dieu accorde cela à un musulman c'est parce qu'il lui fait suffisamment confiance pour savoir si ce qu'il fait est bien ou mal. Je trouve que si chacun était à sa place, il n'y aurais pas de problème de société comme maintenant. Le problème c'est que les hommes ont abusé de leur pouvoir. Ils entendait ce qu'ils voulais bien et décidaient de choses pas très bien. Ils ont clo?tré leurs femmes, les ont soumises et c'est une chose que nous refusons de vivre actuellement!<br>  <br>  L'homme musulman se doit de respecter sa femme, de la protéger, de la rendre heureuse.

La grossesse et l’accouchement sont donnés comme des raisons supplémentaires pour aimer et apprécier les femmes <br>  <br>  L’homme et la femme ont des devoirs et des responsabilités comparables et les deux font face aux conséquences pour leurs décisions et de leurs actions morales. <br>  <br>  Nulle part le Coran ne mentionne que les “hommes sont supérieurs aux femmes”, ou que l'homme doit battre les femmes etc..à moins que le texte du Coran n’ait été pauvrement traduit en fran?ais. <br>  <br>  Le Coran indique clairement que la seule base de supériorité est la piété et la droiture, non le genre, la race, la couleur ou la richesse.<br>  <br>  Sinon dis moi pourquoi dans les pays non musulmans à la maison, en pleine rue, par temps de guerre ou de paix, des millions de femmes et de jeunes filles sont quotidiennement victimes de violences. <br>  <br>  Les statistiques sur la violence varient considérablement de pays en pays : selon l’ONU, en Grande-Bretagne, 30% des femmes subissent des abus par leurs conjoints ou ex-conjoints. <br>  <br>  Au Nicaragua de 28%, au Bangladesh de 47%, au Canada de 29%, dans le Sud et le Sud-est de l’Anatolie (Turquie) de 58%, en Australie de 23%, au Cambodge de 16%. <br>  <br>  En Suisse, lors d’une enquête représentative, une femme sur cinq entre 20 et 60 ans a indiqué avoir subi de la violence physique ou sexuelle par son partenaire ou son conjoint.<br>  <br>  Aux USA Jusqu‘à 70% des femmes assassinées le sont par leurs conjoints masculins alors que 700 000 femmes sont violées ou victimes d’autres formes d’agressions sexuelles chaque année. 14,8% de ces femmes ont moins de 17 ans. <br>  <br>  En Russie, 14 000 femmes ont été tuées par leurs partenaires ou proches.<br>  <br>  Enfin en  France, entre 50 000 et 90 000 femmes ont été violées, et de nombreuses victimes n’ont pas dénoncé leur viol alors que d'aprés un rapport gouvernemental une femme meurt tout les trois jours!!<br>  <br>  Bon je vais m'arrêtter là parce que j'ai le vertiges avec ces chiffres!|`|8dCTrCgDaa	Ma réponse sera à la fois une question.<br>  Les musulmans qui ont la conception basse et animale de la femme savent-ils aimer ?<br>  Est-il vrai que le Prophète avait conseillé de battre la femme?<br>  Les termes changent avec les époques et les gens qui lisent les écrits d'antan.<br>  Dans la bible "battre" signifie parler sévèrement, agresser verbalement.<br>  Le lecteur du coran devait se replacer dans le contexte Mahoméen, avant d'interpréter les paroles qui y sont.<br>  Ne mettez pas ces ouvrages dans les mains de n'importe qui.<br>  Donnez-les aux vrais musulmans qui respectent les femmes, qui les considèrent comme leurs semblables, pas à ceux qui n'arrivent pas à s'assumer parce que eunuques cérébraux...et  physiques. <br>  La femme doit être respectée.On ne l'a bat pas, on la cajole.<br>  Ou alors ne vous mariez-pas.|`|FgCkUSw3aa	as-tu bien interprété cette sourat?|`|GBHF4116aa	quand on lit le Coran il faut bien le comprendre!! <br>  salam|`|GctkWyD0aa	Non en fait, fais juste comme il est ecrit dans la Bible, l'homme quittera son pere et sa mere et il s'attachera a sa femme... et les deux ne formeront plus qu'une seule chaire! <br>   conclusion aime ta femme et ne la tape pas, sinon u n'aimes pas et tu tapes ta propre chaire lol.... epui grossomodo faite L'AMOUR!!!PAS LA GUERRE|`|GfDrI9cRaa	Cette question est pertinente et il faut au contraire remercier celui qui l'a proposée à notre réflexion.<br>  IL faut tout d'abord dire un mot du contexte historique :  quand l'Islam naquit en Arabie qui était à l'époque polythéiste , les femmes étaient effectivement battues.Mais ce n'était pas une coutume exclusivement arabe puisqu'elle  existait également chez d'autres peuples .<br>  Le Prophète Mohammad n'éleva jamais la voix contre une épouse et encore moins la frappa. Après son exil (hédjir) à Médine , il y trouva les mêmes habitudes de brutalité envers les femmes ; ce qui le décida à établir le "qisas" qui permettait à la femme battue de battre à son tour et publiquement ,son mari .<br>   Bien entendu cela ne fut pas accepté de bon coeur et la tension alla en augmentant ,car le qisas dura 3 ans. A un moment donné la situation devint intenable et c'est à ce moment-là que descendit le verset coranique sur l'autorisation de battre sa femme dans des conditions très particulières.<br>  Peut-on dire que Dieu a désavoué son Prophète ? pas du tout ; mais la société d'alors avait besoin d'un certain temps de mutation ; il fallait donc attendre que les esprits évoluent. La mesure d'interdiction prise par le Prophète était donc en avance sur son temps !<br>  Mais il faut bien remarquer qu'une autorisation n'est pas synonyme d'obligation religieuse ; or tout ce qui n'est pas "fardh" peut-être aboli. Tout au plus la mesure entrait dans ce qui était permis; mais là aussi, ce qui est permis peut être interdit quand l'intêret public l'exige. <br>  IL faut donc comprendre que le Coran n'avait  fait qu'une concession provisoire imposée par la coutume et le contexte historique , mais assortie d'une très forte réprobation.<br>   Le Prophète renonca momentanément au qisas mais n'abandonna pas la partie; il temporisa en attendant une situation plus favorable pour ne pas mettre l'ordre social en péril.<br>  Cela nous amène à dire qu'on ne peut pas bien agir contre la volonté d'un peuple qui n'est pas encore m?r pour accepter les mesures nécessaires à sa transformation.<br>  De cette histoire ,nous pouvons tirer une le?on de politique sociale qui doit inspirer nos législateurs lesquels ne doivent pas confondre vitesse et précipitation dans tout ce qu'ils entreprennent en matière sociale.<br>   Il m' a été donné de voir des femmes couvertes sur tout le corps de bleus consécutifs à des coups de batons ou de lanières de cuir.<br>   S'il existe une loi qui interdit la maltraitance des animaux , peut-on rester insensible devant les violences corporelles infligées aux femmes ?<br>  <br>  Aujourd'hui, la maltraitance des femmes doit être interdite et une éducation des hommes doit impérativement se faire dans ce sens , car   LE  CORAN  N'EST   PAS  UN  TEXTE FIGE , il est  VIVANT  et doit  être ainsi compris dans un monde en perpétuelle évolution voulue par Dieu .<br>   L'ijtihed des savants musulmans est plus que jamais interpelé.|`|ae04071dd5960f81a5626c5f10f2d95eaa	il ya question et question...il y a fa?on de poser une question et fa?on....celle la est la pire. pour te répondre je vais poser des question du même genre...<br>  1.es t il normal de diffuser sur les écrans de télévision des femmes nues et des êtres humains qui s accouplent comme des animaux...comme c est le cas sur des cha?nes de télévision de pays très catholiques?...<br>  <br>  2.es t il normal de voir des femmes se prostituer et défiler pour revendiquer leur désir et liberté de vendre leur corps comme c est le cas dans bien des capitales et villes de province occidentales?<br>  <br>  3es t il normal de voir des jeunes filles afficher leur liberté sexuelle et avoir des amants sans compter avant de vivre plus tard comme épouse et mère d enfants qui ne sauront jamais quel  est leur vrai père biologique?<br>  <br>  4. es t il normal de voir l homosexualité portée a son apogée et des hommes se marier entr eux ou des femmes entr elles?<br>  <br>  5. es t il normal de voir des couples homosexuels accéder au droit parental et avoir le droit d adopter un enfant qui appellera maman un autre homme  ou papa une autre femme?<br>  <br>  6. es t il normal que l infidélité dans le couple soit banalisée a ce point que rares sont les couples occidentaux qui dépassent vint ans de mariage ?<br>  <br>  7 es t il normal que la perversion sexuelle atteigne un tel niveau que la pédophilie soit devenue une véritable calamité sociale dans certains pays très catholiques?

Un de ces styles est connu comme un style sautant. Ce style a causé l'utilisation générale de lourds murs et de jetées à la place des murs clairs et des colonnes qui avaient souffert pour soutenir des toits de bois. Un autre style utilisé dans Auvergne est la structure Byzantine.

Im Gegenteil: Der Islam unterstützt sportliche Aktivit?ten. <br>  Es gibt auch im Islam mystische Richtungen, wie etwa die Sufis. Solange sie nicht gegen Anordnungen des Koran versto?en, gibt es gegen sie ebenfalls keine Einw?nde. Der Mensch ist nicht nur ein k?rperliches, sondern auch ein geistiges Wesen. Er soll also auch entsprechend sowohl seinen K?rper als auch seinen Geist fit halten.|`|k1HE3INSaa	Nimm dir Koran in die Hand und lese.

Dafür sind die Sufis vielerorts nicht erwünscht oder ausgeschlossen. Doch beweist dies, dass auch Esoterik ein Weg zu Gott sein kann - auch im Islam.<br>  Das islamische Mittelalter war sehr liberal; aus dieser Zeit stammen viele Literaturen über Mystik und Esoterik im Islam. Auch fromme Dichter, wie Hafis, verschrieben sich dem "unrechten" Weg.<br>  Du siehst, es hindert dich garnichts daran. Ich glaube kaum, dass dich Gott deshalb nicht mehr lieben wird, wenn du ihn auf andere Weise suchst.

YrrtMS5Taa	Yes I have.<br>  <br>  It is VERY normal for people in their teen and young adult years to question their sexuality. <br>  What should you do? Think about it. Decide if you really are interested in this girl or if you're just curious about what it would be like to do certain "things" with a girl. If you're really interested in her, why not just ask her out? Take her aside and tell her "I've never been with another girl before, but I feel really attracted to you and wonder if you would go to a movie with me this Friday? (or other suitable date)" <br>  Despite what many Christians will tell you, your sexuality is not a choice. You are born that way or you aren't, end of story. Good luck, I hope everything works out for you!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and, no, don't look at porn. Plenty of completely straight women are turned on by lesbian porn, you will only end up even more confused than before.|`|gQZZWHHkaa	Funny you should ask becuase I was just about to ask the same,but yes as of right not especially. I have friend whom is a girl and knows I'm gay. We were texting and she's like "I actually like you a little." I had a moment of happiness of a second where I was like "I like her too," but the thought flew out of my head in seconds and I don't even know why but then I was thinking and it occured that I just never was affectionate with women ( had two girlfriends before admitting I was gay). And now I have someone saying I fake being gay for attention...|`|94AXTlL2aa	follow your instincts, don't go against the current of what you are feeling, that will only bring regret.<br>  <br>  um... jesus will not hate you jesus loves everybody.<br>  religious nuts and homophobes will hate you but you just have to believe in karma and that one day, all their hate will come back to bite them in the ***.<br>  <br>  i think that everybody gay and straight have asked themselves that questions..like about their own sexuality i have asked my straight guy friends and they said that yeah, they have thought about it.|`|o3SB4H11aa	Yeah, i doubt it all the time.

It takes time to figure it all out.|`|DzuMRuDfaa	Sexuality is an extremely confusing and difficult topic for some people- included me. I'm still not exactly sure what to call myself, but I lean somewhere on the gay end of the spectrum. I asked questions on here about what I should do about it. Most people said, "Don't label yourself," or "Go with flow."<br>  <br>  If you're interested in another girl, then "Go with the flow" or explore your feelings- and by that I don't mean, "go have sex with every girl you're attracted to." Just be yourself and don't shut down or dismiss your feelings. It will only make you feel worse!|`|yyDvNEJ8aa	yeah i doubted it. i wanted to make sure i wasnt limiting my self to one gender , so i started to look at girls in another way, but i wasnt so into it. so im just straight now.<br>  <br>  its okay. i bet every girl does it. just to make sure of them selves.<br>  just go with whatever you want to do. if you realize your into this girl, then maybe you should try to work something out.|`|aJB1OPoFaa	yes yes and until now I'm still confused and I hope GOD can answer me.
2TavF36Daa	Yes, by all means. True Christians give up religion for a personal relationship with Christ.<br>  <br>  Religion is man's attempt to make things right with God. It is not what God wants from man.<br>  <br>  So, yes. Go ahead and feel free to give it up....|`|ZH58ckgjaa	The purpose behind Lent boils down to getting rid of something that will tempt you and distract you from concentrating on God.<br>  <br>  Have you ever had a bad habit  that took a long time to get rid of, and you needed some assistance and guidance alon the way?

Im sure you were trying to be funny.|`|jard50Yiaa	Lent, in some Christian denominations, is the forty-day-long liturgical season of fasting and prayer before Easter. The forty days represent the time Jesus spent in the desert, where according to the Bible he endured temptation by Satan. Different churches calculate the forty days differently.<br>  <br>  The purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer—through prayer, penitence, almsgiving and self-denial—for the annual commemoration during Holy Week of the Death and Resurrection of Jesus, which recalls the events linked to the Passion of Christ and culminates in Easter, the celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  In Western Christianity (with the exception of the Archdiocese of Milan which follows the Ambrosian Rite), Lent begins on Ash Wednesday and concludes on Holy Saturday. The six Sundays in Lent are not counted among the forty days because each Sunday represents a "mini-Easter", a celebration of Jesus' victory over sin and death.<br>  <br>  In those churches which follow the Byzantine tradition (e.g. Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholics), the forty days of Lent are calculated differently: the fast begins on Clean Monday, Sundays are included in the count, and it ends on the Friday before Palm Sunday. The days of Lazarus Saturday, Palm Sunday and Holy Week are considered a distinct period of fasting.|`|DArAz67Caa	only catholics strictly follow lent-----I am no longer a catholic----so I need not worry----I usually gave up sweets when I was a young girl----however--

Just because you are a good person and die young has nothing to do with God, just being a good person isn't good enough to get into Heaven. You only get to Heaven through Jesus. |`|TYstsM7Yaa	When someone dies young it is often, because well they happend to die. Depends on each case.

One wonders if people are really too dense to understand what you're getting at in these questions or if they are consciously or subconsciously obfuscating. <br>  <br>  Ok guys, here's the deal. Basically, the woman is being punished here for marrying a guy (likely unknowingly) that is impotent. Her first husband, the one who put her in this situation (along with Muhammad, the law-decreer) cannot save her from it. How pathetic to make a woman frantic to stick one man's penis inside of her and have him ejaculate so that she can be with the man she really wants. That is really tragically unfair. Make the man have to take the penis and ejacula- he's the one that caused the problem to begin with (along with Muhammad, the law decreer, let's not forget). Oh, but he would then  be thrown from the top of a mountain for being a homosexual as per "Allah's perfect law". My bad.|`|bfWcfCKXaa	Well, this is easy in Christianity. The second husband is unlawful because there is and can be only one spouse for life - the first one. If you divorce and remarry, you commit adultery. Period. The second marriage is not recognized by the Church as lawful. and in the Catholic Church, you would be barred from the holy sacraments until such time as the second marriage union is dissolved.|`|whkC5077aa	No, the procedure is, if the husband divorced his wife for the third times, then they cannot be together again until the woman got married to other man, normal or not and divorced, then only he could take her back as his wife or remarried her again.|`|CRypMJAzaa	I don't understand what someone's personal life has got to do with a question...As shown by muslims above.<br>  <br>  I guess he should have massaged himself with the black seed oil-the cure all remedy for the islamic world, because there was no Viagra available, or did that not work either.|`|02I8uxdpaa	love for all hatred for none|`|c1Mq2ejmaa	well who the f marries the same person three times?|`|h6vqu7mjaa	[2:230] If he divorces her (for the third time), it is unlawful for him to remarry her, unless she marries another man, then he divorces her. The first husband can then remarry her, so long as they observe GOD's laws. These are GOD's laws; He explains them for people who know. <br>  <br>  In other words, if the couple reconciles after the first divorce and wish to be husband and wife again, they can re-marry. This is allowed for two divorce only. If the couple divorces third time they have to observe God's commandment in 2:230 (quoted below.) God makes it not-so-easy for the couple to divorce. This law serves as a deterrent for those who want a divorce for the third time and they would be very careful to take this step. <br>  It is not lawful for a woman to divorce her husband and remarry here former husband until there is full consummation Allah knows best.|`|Ztiy3jjwaa	The concept of halalah, where the divoree of three times (Talaq-e-Mugallazah) is required to marry another man and have the marriage consummated as a precondition for her to revert to her husband is expressly mentioned in the Qur'?n (Baqarah: 230) and Ahadith Bukhari.<br>  The concept of halalah is:<br>  :  The husband should understand the implications of three divorces and exercise restraint.<br>  : If he does not contain himself, he cannot be given an unlimited right of divorce.<br>  : The institution of halalah is to protect a woman against the abuse of divorce.<br>  There is absolutely no dignity or honor for a woman if she can be repeatedly divorced.<br>  Husband must understand that he is restricted to the number of divorces, and be advised that divorce is the most abhorred thing.<br>  The incident of the wife of Rifa'ah Al-Qurazi who was previously married to Abdul Rahman Ibn Zabeer is recorded in book of Hadith and in Bukhari.|`|mVSC9aKoaa	Punishment for 3 divorce.|`|287ae5682476df003fc4d95ff463997aaa	Because after the third and final divorce a man gives to his wife she is unlawful to him until she has married (with consummation) and been divorced by another man.  <br>  <br>  And the woman cannot just marry a random guy with intent to divorce him... marriage must be with intent to actually live a married life with him.  If then he divorces her she would be able to marry her previous husband again.

This is not to defend the present-day political view called Creationism which asserts that the Bible says that the universe and living things were created in 24-hour days a few thousand years ago, but you should know that, in fairness to the Bible record, the Bible clearly allows an indefinite amount of time for the creation of the universe in its opening words in Genesis 1:1, "In [the] beginning God created the heavens and the earth. "<br>  <br>  In verse two, if plainly says that 'darkness' was over the earth, not the universe or heavens, since the stars were created in verse 1, possibly taking billions of years. <br>  <br>  The following four "days" do not use the Hebrew word for "create", but "make", and apparently deal with the clearing of a cloud cover at the earth, 'making' first diffused light, then sun, moon and stars visible in the "heavens," that is, the sky, (Matthew 6:26; 2 Chronicles 2:6). To this day most of the planets have cloud covers. And Gen. 2:4 clearly shows that the "days" were not the 24-hour variety, calling all seven "days" ONE "day". <br>  <br>  So Gen. 1:1 covers the formation of the visible universe, including the sun, earth, moon and stars, when it says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." The creative "days" all cover the detail of the preparation of the earth and its atmosphere for human habitation.<br>  <br>  Regarding intelligent design, some common-sense questions. For instance, a bird called the Blackpoll Warbler has been tracked flying from Alaska to New England and then out over the Atlantic, catching the Jet Stream back to South America, then flying back all the way to Alaska every year.<br>  <br>  If somebody asked US to construct a flying machine that can fly from Alaska to New England to South America and back unaided, could we? But suppose they also asked us to make it weigh less than one ounce, like the bird. Could we? And nothing may touch it to build it--it must build itself, because that is what the Blackpoll Warbler does in its egg, doesn't it? Feathers, dual TV cameras, flight computer and all. From a speck in an egg. Would we even try? Could the US government? The entire University system, with an impressive array of bright students, knowledgeable professors and able administrators? All those advanced human brains combined, connected together by the Internet? No? So how much sense does it make to say that blind, unthinking Chance just "accidentally" did so through blind, unthinking evolution? <br>  <br>  My young school friend pointed out that since we have about 100 trillion cells in our body and each has about 5 feet of DNA, that makes about 100 trillion times 5 feet, or 100 billion times 5000 feet (about a mile), or 100 billion miles of perfect code that is required to make us a body that works. Since the characters (the "letters") that that code is "printed" in are actually the size of molecules, that makes a lot of "typing" to give us a body. Could we type that much without making a mistake, since any mistake would cause a genetic weakness or birth defect? Could blind chance? <br>  <br>  Another thing. Ever tried to swat a fly? Not necessarily easy, right? Know why? It has to do with the fly's navigational system. It has a single vibrating rod in its abdomen, and as it changes direction in flight, it senses the changes in the vibrations of that rod and is able to dodge you, fly and land upside down and backwards. What would the Air Force pay to have flying and navigational systems that good?<br>  <br>  How did the fly manage to evolve such a system? Even if it evolved the vibrating rod, what good would it be without the nerves to send the signals from the rod to the brain? And the section of the brain to interpret the signals? And the correct instructions to interpret them? And the correct instructions to the part of the brain that controlled the wings as to what to DO about those signals? All AT THE SAME TIME. Wouldn't that be a remarkable coincidence? I ask people, "Could YOU sit down, right now, and write the code for such a set of instructions? And if your ten billion well trained and coordinated neurons put together can't do it with an education and a computer, is it really sensible to think that flies did it by themselves?"<br>  <br>  The fly has a complete navigational system that is self-constructing (in its egg), self-reproducing, self-programming, self-correcting, that can fly upside down and backwards, avoiding dangers and locating and recognizing fuel (food), that requires even MORE entire, completely developed systems that even large groups of highly educated humans cannot or are only now beginning to be able to copy (and only by intelligent design), all microminiaturized into a space smaller than the head of a pin, with the code for it in characters that are the size of molecules (I wonder how many characters per inch that works out to? Pretty hi-tech data storage). <br>  <br>  So I ask people, "In your experience, how many complete flying and navigational systems do you know of that have happened completely by accident, with no intelligent thought or design?" "Did you ever read the story of all the thought and work needed to design and build a flying machine, as told by the Wright brothers themselves? So how scientific is it to say that it just happened by blind accidents in the case of the lowly, incredibly complex fly?"<br>  <br>  This isn't defending the horrible things that have been done, like the Inquisition, and unscientific things taught, like a 7,000-year-old earth, by very fallible people supposedly in God's name...<br>  <br>  Best regards,<br>  Mike|`|AA10988107	WHY NOT FACTS?<br>  <br>  Gen.1:1,2 [ all exist ], how old is it?

The more ancient Egyptians, from research I have done, and sculptures and displays I have seen were easily dark enough to be considered black today.

Modern biochemistry, the study of life at the molecular level, has revealed some of that intricacy. It has also raised serious questions and doubts about Darwin’s theory.The components of cells are made up of molecules. Cells are the building blocks of all living creatures. Professor Behe is Roman Catholic and believes in evolution to explain the later development of animals. However, he raises serious doubts about whether evolution can explain the existence of the cell. He speaks of molecular machines that “haul cargo from one place in the cell to another along ‘highways’ made of other molecules .?.?. Cells swim using machines, copy themselves with machinery, ingest food with machinery. In short, highly sophisticated molecular machines control every cellular process. Thus the details of life are finely calibrated, and the machinery of life enormously complex.”<br>  <br>  Now, all of this activity is taking place on what scale? A typical cell is only one thousandth of an inch [0.03 mm] across! In that infinitesimal space, complex functions vital to life are occurring.Little wonder that it has been said: “The bottom line is that the cell—the very basis of life—is staggeringly complex.”<br>  <br>  Behe argues that the cell can function only as a complete entity. Thus, it cannot be viable while being formed by slow, gradual changes induced by evolution. He uses the example of a mousetrap. This simple apparatus can function only when all its components are assembled. Each component on its own—platform, spring, holding bar, trap hammer, catch—is not a mousetrap and cannot function as such. All the parts are needed simultaneously and have to be assembled for there to be a working trap. Likewise, a cell can function as such only when all its components are assembled. He uses this illustration to explain what he terms “irreducible complexity.”The irreducibly complex cell is a major stumbling block to belief in Darwin’s theory. In the first place, evolution cannot explain the leap from inanimate to animate matter. Then comes the problem of the first complex cell, which must arise in one fell swoop as an integrated unit. In other words, the cell (or, the mousetrap) must appear out of nowhere, assembled and functioning!|`|QLDMmp6Taa	No.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Who created Humans.? People may say The Big Bang.

Hadiths have been narrated by close companions of the Prophet ( peace be upon him ) of his sayings and practices. The companions of the Prophets ) peace be upon him ) were very pious and the best of Muslims among us. <br>  Time and time again we are told by Allah swt in the Qur'an to obey the messenger ( peace be upon him ) and that he is the best example for mankind to follow. To obey the Messenger and follow his examples of how he led his life in accordance to the command of Allah we need authentic references to abide by the rule of Allah. The Qur'an and the Messenger ( peace be upon him ) were sent as a guidance to mankind. We have the everlasting Qur'an but we do not have Prophet Muhammad ( saws ) with us today but we do have genuine recorded hadiths of his sunnah. The Qur'an and sunnah go hand in hand and complement each other, to fully implement what Allah commands us to do. The Qur'an tells us to pray and perform hajj, but it doesn't mention how to perform these acts. This is where the role of the Prophet (saws) comes into. Without these hadiths we would not know what his sunnah was. <br>  Authentic hadiths have been thoroughly checked and verified and by the grace of Allah hadiths still remains today for Muslims to follow with the Qur'an.

Afro centrists claim the Ancient Nubians/peoples of Kemit were the Ancient Egyptians AGAINST DNA(haploid) Testing and anthropological measurements of the MAJORITY of the mummies and Modern Egyptians.Egypt Arab Semitic White annexed part of Nubia in 1520 B.C.(remainder modern day Sudan). The war in Sudan is in part because the indigent Black Sudanese feel the immigrant Arab Semitic Whites are spreading too fast and will annex the rest of Sudan to Egypt.The Janjaweed are Black Sudanese whom have sided with the Arab Semitic Whites, accepting, Islam, learning Arabic,and Arab culture. They are killing other Black Sudanese, their own ethnicity, and are considered traitors by the Black Sudanese, as they are.1/2 of Sudan is Arab Semitic White and Sudan is part of North Africa(1/3 of Africa-Arab Semitic White). Berbers and Moors are Arabs with 8-15% Black heritage. Hamites are around  50-50% mix.Egypt is and has been 65% Arab Semitic White, 30% Black(mostly Nubian, some Nilotics, Black Arab mix-Berbers, Moors, Hamites, and 5% all other ethnicities. Ethiopia is Black, but 1/3 of its population is Arab Semitic White-models Iman(Somalian) and Lila Kebede(Ethiopian), both, have Arab Semitic White fathers. Like any other ethnic group(i.e.-Indo European Aryan White-Germany-there are other ethnicities living among them , including Blacks-that does not mean Germans are Black or that Blacks are Indo European Aryan Whites, yet that is what many would have people believe about the Arab Semitic White ethnicity(that the Black Nubians in Egypt are Arab Semitic Whites or that Arab Semitic Whites are Black).Blacks and Arab Semitic Whites are two different ethnic groups(no, it is not the same situation as in the Hispanic classification(not an ethnicity)).<br>  <br>  King of London-Arabs are NOT Mongoloid, though part of the Middle East lies in Asia, and technically, Arabs could be called White Asians, and Arabs are NOT Black, although part of the Middle East lies in NORTH AFRICA(1/3 of Africa), so Arabs could be called White Africans-Arab Semitic White, NOT, Black none the less . North Africa is Arab Semitic White, NOT, Black-no Black DNA(haploid markers) in Arabs. <br>  <br>  BEFORE the Ancient Egyptians, the pre Egyptian peoples were Black, but Arab invasions around 5,000 B.C. drove most of them out out and assimilated others.The fact stands-the Ancient and Modern Egyptians are Arab Semitic White, NOT, Black Nubians-people of Kemit.Blacks have the advanced ancient Nok(in present day Nigeria) kingdom to be proud of.|`|8auEgQf2aa	Egyptians no Ethiopians yes<br>  Arab is not a race its like Hispanic its a culture/language group they can be of any race people....<br>  Egyptians are predominately of South West Asian decent (Arabian Peninsula) mixed with Southern Europeans and Indigenous North Africans (Black).|`|kqMDzJw0aa	The original Egyptians were Black.

AA11780840	Give them a call and provide him or her with your cell phone number and inform her that you will be out of town. That you will not have access to your home phone. and that if you do not pick up on your cell have her leave a message and you will get back to her ASAP... Then give the interviewer the date you will be back... Life happens... I am sure he/she will be understanding it is not like he/she expects you to wait by the phone for her call. You don't even need to let him/her know its vacation just that you will be out of town.... Don't worry about... Be upfront and say Hey I just wanted to give you my cell number where you can reach me....If he/she does ask say you where you are going then tell him/her you will be vacationing but I am sure he/she won't..<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you get the job...|`|U8oR3VU6aa	I would leave her my cell number. Being absent right at the time the job is supposed to be available sends a negative message. Forward your voice mail or leave her your cell number. Or depending on how important this job is to you, postpone the fun and sun until you have secured the position. If you start telling her you will be on vacation at the time the job is available tells the interviewer the job takes a back seat to your personal plans.|`|J1kJb98Maa	a new boss does not want to hear about vacation and to get in touch with me and blah blah blah sounds like you are a complication more than a asset <br>  make it easy for them or they will find some who wants it more|`|sXnoIFRsaa	Your cell phone number should have been on your contact information.<br>  It is the one you always answer so that is the contact number you should call or e-mail her and give her that number|`|wch6Ojd7aa	It does seem unprofessional. <br>  <br>  This is what I would do:<br>  <br>  If your cell phone number isn′t on your contact info, tell her the one she has on your resume is out of order at the moment and provide her with your cell #.<br>  <br>  If she happens to call and needs you to go down there for another interview or something, tell her you had to go out of town unexpectedly and you can shorten your vacation a few days or tell her when you′ll be available.

zxTlB4gbaa	Of course Hollywood should have more curvy actresses. It would be nice to see them, regardless of race. Camryn Manheim is one who comes to mind for me, as well as Rosie O'Donnell, Roseanne Barr, and of course Marilyn Monroe. Every woman is not a size zero, and the sooner that we see fuller figures, the better!|`|0rDDPTi5aa	Yes, they should have more naturally curvy white women like the ones you mentioned.  If you look back at older movies, most women, black and white, were more curvy, not fat, but with natural curves.  Like someone said Marilyn Monroe was a sex symbol and by no means skinny.   I think it was after the model Twiggy came out in the 60's, that the whole stick thin, androgynous look got popular.  It needs to change because it has a unhealthy affect on young girl's self image.|`|7a15c276d2782ca7df8dc93ccf72655caa	I agree.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	Yes! Angelina Jolie is built well in my opinion...but yeah.

I veri vip segnano la storia del cinema, o della tv, della società. Non sono stelle comete. Come ad esempio Virna Lisi. Lei ha iniziato da giovane, però anche adesso ha mantenuto la sua fama, ed è kmq tutt' ora molto brava, usa la testa su tutto (anche nelle interviste, non si vanta, è una donna modesta e riservata). Oppure, anche se ora non c' è +, anche Audrey Hepburn, che era eleganza e stile senza spogliarsi (come fanno molte adesso) ed è tutt'ora una vip, una star. <br>  I vip sono le stelle, quelle vere.

When that lady killed her family, did she do it because god commanded her to? Or because it follows the guidelines in the bible? IF yes, then her religion would have been relevant. Not to mention Islam is not just a religion, but a political system as well.<br>  MOST of the time, when a Muslim commits a crime, they do it for religion( suicide bombers, honour killings). If it was not a crime committed for/about religion, then religion is not relevant. <br>  I can think of plenty of crimes where the person was a Christian/Jewish/Whatever, religion was involved, and you can bet religion was mentioned in the media.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	When IJR first heard the story of the capture of John List, a man who murdered his family and was on the run for many years, they made it very plain that he was a Christian man.

AA11476749	Because of the Fall of Mankind, there are all sorts of problems caused by/through genetics.  We possess a sin nature, and we are responsible for what we do in it, regardless.<br>  <br>  Just as a kleptomaniac can (and should) control their impulses to steal, so should the homosexual, the thief, the drunkard, the junkie, the womanizer, the nymphomaniac, etc.<br>  <br>  What you fail to understand is that believers follow what is written in the Bible.  We believe it is true, because of the changed lives we have personally experienced, and seen in others.<br>  <br>  If God has said that a certain behavior is sin, no amount of "absolute and irrefutable proof" will change our minds, because we will agree that there is a "reason" for our sinful behavior.  Whether a person choose to act on that nature or not is the issue.  Sin remains sin, no matter how we try to dilute it.<br>  <br>  EDIT (responding to Hmmm):  <br>  <br>  I have read Matthew 7:1ff.  Apparently, you feel I have judged.  I did not judge anyone.  I merely stated what the Bible states about sin.  I sin, as do you, along with everyone else.  Homosexuality is no bigger sin in my eyes (or God's for that matter) than theft, adultery, drunkenness, etc.<br>  <br>  The difference is whether or not one's sins have been pardoned by Jesus Christ.  If one faces God on the Day of Judgment without that pardon, they are doomed.  It doesn't matter if they were gay or not.<br>  <br>  I fail to see how anything I said can be considered judging.<br>  <br>  But, even if I DID judge, there are qualifications within the passages there.  Here is but one:  "...the measure you use, it will be measured to you."  (Matthew 7:3)  I will be judged by the length I have judged.  <br>  <br>  There is a further qualification that I have yet to mention.  Here it is:<br>  <br>  The Greek word that is translated "judge" there is "krino," (Strong's #2929) and means "to distinguish, i.e. decide (mentally or judicially); by implication, to try, condemn, punish..."<br>  <br>  So, when Jesus was speaking of not judging someone, it was about condemnation. In other words, we don't decide who is going to hell. That judgment is left to Him alone.<br>  <br>  Now, another passage, I Corinthians 2:15, that has more to do with discernment. The Greek word is "anakrino," (Strong's #350) of which "krino" is a root. The implications are different, though. It means "to scrutinize, i.e. (by implication) investigate, interrogate, determine..."<br>  <br>  This has to do with observing facts, and making a determination.<br>  <br>  In some of the other cases, Paul does use "krino," especially with the man who did the horizontal polka with his father's wife. He further qualifies that the judgment is so he can be saved ultimately, so even then, he is not condemning the man to hell.  (Cf. I Corinthians 5:1ff)|`|3m00lxxuaa	If so, either way, should an STD be considered a good thing because of someone who was born with it?|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	The problem is, Abrahamic religion is false, so anyone spouting an opinion from that perspective is automatically wrong.|`|azq1win0aa	No. First off you are assuming I've condemned someone to hell for sinning. I believe there is no condemnation in Christ, My judgement is based on the Word of God telling me it's a sin so no I wouldn't ever apologize for telling the truth. How is it prideful to tell someone that it's not how God created them? I would never embrace any sin. <br>  <br>  life you are grossly taking that verse out of context.. homosexuals are not vessels of wrath they are choosing sin .. like a lot of people do.|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	They're already positioning themselves for that one.

We are all born into sin of one kind or another. We all have temptations to do the things that God has commanded us not to do. Participating in homosexual activity is no greater a sin than is fornication or adultry, stealing or envy, gluttony or hatefulness. Those that condemn people because of their sin are not representative of God. He loves sinners just as much as he loves those that choose not to sin regardless of the temptations.<br>  <br>  Gay people need to know that. It must be very difficult for them to live in a world that condemns them as people because of their sin...rather than seeing them as people. But in some ways, some in this world condemn all of us because of our sins....but God does not. He offers his forgiveness through the love of his Son.|`|26cb6190c99a848bb4c18aed374707c0aa	Im a fundie that believes that many homosexuals are born gay.

Also, genetic defects can sometimes lead to gender ambiguity, so sexual orientation could be a minor version of this defect.<br>  <br>  So what? I expect people to act morally and with restraint whether homosexual or heterosexual. Besides, being born with a tendency toward something doesn't make it acceptable. Should people born with impulsiveness or aggression issues be allowed to harm others just because they were "born that way?" I think not. Should someone with Pradder-Willy syndrome eat themself to death, because they are predisposed to do so? No way.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, Christians should embrace homosexuals-but not homosexuality. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. God loves us anyway, he just doesn't like what we do. If someone wants to become a Christian and be saved, however, they must admit his or her sins and try to overcome them, not take pride in them.<br>  <br>  Do Christians always accept homosexuals? Probably not because the idea is appalling to us just like we are to love the sick, but might not be too fond of getting sneezed on. Disgust is learned, and in this case appropriate, since homosexuality is unacceptable behavior based on God's intentions in creating sex. But we need to learn to see past the bad to the value in the person that is still God's beloved child.|`|7Arh80GIaa	<br>  God is not going to tell Christians to listen to His requirements in -:<br>  <br>  1Co 6:9-10 :  "What! Do you not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men,?nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom "<br>  <br>  If homosexuals were 'born' that way, it would be the height of cruelty for God to lump them in this list with murderers, drunkards, extortioners etc. (lifestyles people choose)  and condemn them from entry into His Kingdom..<br>  <br>  Sexuality is formed from infancy and too many youths today are exposed to pornography at a very young age. They mistake the 'turn on ' factor as their orientation because they see a picture or film that gets their hormones going and just conclude that they must be gay.<br>  <br>  If self control was a prized possession in the area of sex relations then such a command would not be necessary. <br>  <br>  |`|S7T5a25yaa	Well, the evidence to date does not provide evidence that homosexuality is genetic and actually reparative therapy is making inroads into psychology. But IF there was concrete genetic evidence, this would NOT mean anything in terms of if homosexuality is right or wrong. For instance, someone born with both male and female organs (for which there are many examples or abundant 'genetic evidence'), would still not allow them to freely have bisexual relationships from a religious point of view. Genetic evidence does not determine morality.  |`|AA10293793	if it is proved irrefutably that they are born gay, i will be right. that has always been my contention. what's more, i think it's a criminal waste of time and resources to try to figure out what causes homosexuality. it doesn't matter. as far as i'm concerned, all that matters is that it is not something that gay people can control.<br>  <br>  however, i am going to make a guess that the people you are talking about, the real religious bigots, who spout intolerance and hide behind such nonsense as "i don't hate them, just the sin", would happily embrace the knowledge that the cause was found, and immediately start campaigning for a "cure". that scares the daylights out of me because when religious bigots start trying to save you, things like the spanish inquisition happen.|`|0DgByoFpaa	im christian and im puzzled myself too. maybe people can be born gay. there are animals that are homosexual in the natural world.. if God created animals (some whom are gay) then there is a possibility that people are born gay.<br>  <br>  i dont judge gay people. because i feel sorry for them that they are (if i could say so) born that way and have to struggle against so many opposing arguments and live in a world of confusion, self-doubt etc. especially if they are religious.|`|gGhhVD8saa	If someone really is born gay then that is the way they are.

There are 100s of genetic foopahs, and having traits of dominance male in a female and vica versa is surely possible.  The Bible condemns the act of homosexuality in the Old Testament.  These are laws.  When Christ came to earth, he overturned all the laws into one commandment. A new covenant.  Love one another.

BEING homosexual is not a sin.  ACTING on homosexual tendencies is objectively wrong.  I understand that a lot of folks don't agree with me, but that is my belief and I have every right to it, and I have a right to voice it.<br>  <br>  I (and my church) don't know if homosexuality is an effect of nature, nurture, or both.  My faith tries not to get into teaching science.  I think it's entirely possible that some folks are born with the "cross" of being gay....the same way some are born with diseases.  I am not calling homosexuality a disease, but we have to admit that is not the statistical "norm" for human beings.<br>  <br>  That said....a person born without legs must bear that cross throughout his life.  He is still called to be patient with others, diligent on what work he does, etc.  A person born with the cross of homosexuality is still called to the same standards of morality that I am...to live chastely according to his state in life.  I am a single Catholic Christian.  I must not have sex with a man I'm not married to.  Homosexuals are not called to any lower standard than that.<br>  <br>  And we can change laws to say that two men or two women can "marry", but it is still not marriage.  Marriage is God's sacrament, not man's.  We don't have the power to change that.<br>  <br>  Everyone has crosses to bear.  And I am sorry for people bearing this one.  But life is not meant to be easy...that's just reality.  And yes, Christians need to KEEP CHRISTIAN and treat homosexual people with the respect and dignity they deserve as fellow children of God.<br>  <br>  I don't know why God chose to give this particular cross to some, but others have borne worse.

Having friends and husbands is okay...|`|TYstsM7Yaa	If you love God most, then marry God. question solved|`|PS6Pjtndaa	There is a saying about Christians ... you'll know us by our love.  Look at 1 Corinthians (AKA "the love chapter"), chapter 13: <br>  <br>  1If I speak in the tongues[a] of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 2If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames,[b] but have not love, I gain nothing. <br>   4Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. <br>  <br>   8Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. 11When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. 12Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. <br>  <br>   13And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.<br>  <br>  You SAY that God is first in your life.  IF SO then you love your neighbor as yourself?  You love your enemies?  You love God with all of your heart and soul?  You're THIS filled with love and yet you have no relationships outside of the Lord?<br>  <br>  Make that make sense!  Something doesn't add up!  Go to a homeless shelter and volunteer your time.  Go to your church and volunteer.  Go to a local hospital or nursing home and volunteer.  Get out in the world, SHOW YOUR LOVE!  SHARE the joy of Christ's love with others.  I promise you that relationships will follow!  I promise you!<br>  <br>  Pray on what I've told you.  LOVE your fellow man!  LOVE the least of thee!  Love, love, love!  <br>  <br>  Lord bless.|`|9BOemzSAaa	The fact of the matter is that God wants for you to find true happiness in your life. You must find joy, and bring joy to others. Having Faith in God doesn't mean that everything you do MUST be about him, it means find happiness and find that strong, long lasting you've been longing for, and together, you and the one you love, should incorporate religion and God into your life. Remember that nobody is perfect, but in God's eyes, as long as you love him, he will love you too. In His eyes, we are all equal!|`|CBUNZ9Ydaa	OK, God should always be first in your life. Let's remove the Bible since it was written by Mankind and only the stuff the churches and kings wanted stayed in. God is in everything and in everybody... omnipresent. Therefore God is you and in you. You should ALWAYS be true to yourself before you can be true to anyone else. It is human nature to want relationships... they will come naturally when you have the confidence and self awareness that you need to move forward in a physical body. You don't need to pray for someone else, just pray or seek balance within yourself. Remember our life's purpose is to seek balance in whatever you pursue. <br>  <br>  God does not hold out on you... God is a life force not a person. We as humans can only identify with something or someone similar to ourselves. The only one holding you back is you. That doesn't mean go out and get crazy with everyone you meet. Remember when you are in balance, balanced energy comes back to you 10 fold. Even in the physical form of relationships. That is what people mean when they tell you when you quit looking for someone you will usually find them. FIND YOURSELF FIRST!<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|kX0T1urdaa	God does not expect you not to have relationships with others. He only says to not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. <br>  <br>  Be a friend to others and you'll have friends. Be true to God and He will bring in the right person to be your soul mate. <br>  <br>  You won't find that person in a bar.|`|Lqcn1ndvaa	Well, worship is supposed to be a group effort, with other people, not by yourself in a corner.

I've fallen in love with him. Someday I'm going to become a nun. Everyone can't become a nun though. You can have all the friends and soul mates you want. You don't have to give any of that away. Keep looking and eventually the right one will come. But trust in Jesus the whole way. Give yourself to him, and he will help you with whatever you need.|`|HbzbJCRBaa	that's true..god will help you find your soul mate but its 50/50<br>  you can't just expect the guy to just out of nowhere come knocking on your door...and go out and make friends|`|Nwno6n70aa	if it seems like you are talking to yourself, you are.
hRYwuCFRaa	Most Chinese respond to a compliment with "nali,nali", which means "not really" although some  young generation are adapting the western way by responding with "xiexie", which means "thank you". <br>  <br>  Traditionally, Chinese are educated to be "humble" instead of "proud"--even though they are proud, they are supposed to  show their pride with humility. <br>  <br>  If a response to your compliment is "nali,nali", don't be confused, it does not mean your compliment is not appreciated, it only means "thank you" in a Chinese way. It's sort of like saying - "ohh, it's nothing really."|`|ajzdsUldaa	This is a bit vague as it could mean different things in several languages.<br>  <br>  For example, in Mandarin-Chinese it means "Where, where?"<br>  <br>  To the idiots saying that "nali" means "not really" in Chinese - no it doesn't. "Nali yo" perhaps, but I've never heard anyone say "nali" alone to mean "not really".<br>  <br>  And no Chinese or native Chinese speaking person I have ever met in my life responds to a compliment with "nali, nali"! "Nali" has always been used to mean "WHERE" in my experience! <br>  <br>  In Chinese, we respond to compliments with "xie xie" meaning "thank you". DUH! The closest to "not really" I know is "na yo", not "nali".<br>  <br>  So whoever said this to you, clearly was not a native speaker.<br>  <br>  Ni men dou shi ben dan!|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	Its chinese (mandarin) and means "not really" which is a chinese way to answer to any compliment or thanks|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	In Mandarin Chinese, 哪裡 (nǎ lǐ) - or sometimes it's written 哪裏 (nǎ lǐ) - can mean two things. It can either mean literally "Where?" or it can be an expression of humbly denying a compliment, like "Oh, no, it was nothing."|`|l1qNr8gQaa	It is Chinese for 'not really'

It is only recently that they have been portrayed as Hispanic/ Arabic looking.  Now people say, well we cannot tell what race they were.  I think all this ignorance will stop when people stop thinking that there is a fence or a sign running across the Sahara Desert, keeping blacks out of North Africa, and that no black Africans live there.  Also, people need to recognize that the boundary for Ancient Egypt was much lower down into Africa than modern day Egypt.  In fact, there are more pyramids in the Sudan than Egypt.  Also, most of the pyramids are in the southern part of Egypt.  When the Greeks and Romans conquered, they put their capitals and cities nearer to the Mediterranean coast.  Then later, Arabic people came.   National Geographic did an article on the Black Pharaohs of Egypt, so its not like it is total fairy tales.  <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/02/black-pharaohs/robert-draper-text" rel="nofollow">http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/0...</a><br>  <br>  So yes, some Egyptians were black.

Modern day Egyptians are mixed mostly.|`|T1beLIQqaa	N0-65% (both modern and ancient Egyptians) were Arab Semitic White. Here we go again-this seems to be a very popular question.Most are Arab(Semitic White) and has been since 5,000 B.C..When the Arabs conquered and settled the area now known as Egypt(Arabic name given by the Arabs(Semitic Whites)-the area had no name before this The Black leaders of Nubia/Kemet which made up the southern quarter of Egypt(lost to the Arabs) and Sudan, made a pact with the Arabs so as not to be destroyed and permitted to to become Pharoahs, hence some Black Egyptian Dynasties(800-700 B.C.) much like the Indian Police and scouts when the European Whites drove out the Indians in America.This is based on fact and often gets many thumbs down and disagreements by racists,including many Blacks.<br>  <br>  The Egyptians are Arabs(Semitic Whites).The pre Egyptians were Black(mostly Nubian, some Nilotics).Nubia/Kemet(making up 1/4 of southern Egypt and the remainder in Sudan) was conquered by the Arabs-the Black Nubians making a pact with the Arabs to be Pharaohs.<br>  <br>  The feaures of the Sphinx are White by facial structure-the nose being busted away could have provided more clues-the thin lips, high forehead, and recessed jaw are Caucasian (White) features.<br>  <br>  ******ARABS (SEMITIC WHITES) AND BLACKS ARE TWO DIFFERENT ETHINICITIES.ARABS ARE GENERALLY SWARTHY(olive colored/golden brown skin).******<br>  <br>  Because people live/or originated in Africa, does not make them Black, but Africans, much like being American does not mean everyone is White.<br>  <br>  The builders of the pyamids were Arabs(Semitic Whites-yes like Jesus and other Jews, and, Arabs and Jews ARE related) and as proven by genetic(DNA) tests on the mummies, anthropological measurements, and asking the Egyptians themselves. Egypt is an ARABIC name-no name prior to this, existed for Egypt.Before the Arab invasions and pyramid buildings,pre- Egyptian Black Africans did inhabit the area in ancient(keyword) times(before Arab-Semitic White invasions and settlement).Most were driven out by the Arabs(Semitic Whites),much like the European Whites drove out the American Indians in America -the few remaining, intermingled(mixed unions producing descendants) with the Arabs, some even making pacts to become Pharaohs(i.e.-Nubians/peoples of Kemet), much like European Whites allowing Indian police and scouts.Many of the people on wall art are, in fact, Black Egyptian slaves(also some free) as well as peoples of other ethnic backgrounds-much like in America, and the difference shows up in the use of different pigments and physical features drawn-many standing side by side.Many drawings, paintings, statues, and other likenesses of King Tut do exhibit both Black and Semitic White physical characteristics, most notably in his facial likeness(even this varies the spectrum from Arab(Semitic White) to Arab(Semitic White)/Black admixture). He is portrayed anywhere from light brown skin to dark black skin.<br>  <br>  Because Egypt is in Africa, many Blacks, as above, erroneously claim Egypt as Black , when it has NOT been since at least prior to the pyramid building about 5,000 B.C.-MUCH AS IF THE AMERICAN INDIANS WERE TO CLAIM ALL OF AMERICA IS INDIAN.Egypt's culture and foods are Arabic, far different than Black culture and food. Many Blacks often point to Anwar Sadat as being Black. In fact,he was half White(Egyptian-Semitic White) and half Black(Sudanese mother)-denied this until shortly before his death).<br>  <br>  Present day Egypt is 65% White(Semitic Arab)-comparable to 70% of the White population of the US- and 35% nonwhite(predominately Black admixtures and Black, with the remainder Asian(Oriental and Non Oriental(Indo Ruropean Aryan), Indo European Aryan-Greeks, Romans, Turks,Iranians/Perians, etc., and other Semites(mainly Jews)).<br>  <br>  To my Black friends and others, bottom line, Egypt(an Arabic name) is Semitic White and has been since the building of the pyramids based both on history and genetic(DNA) testing on the mummies and yes, some of the Pharaohs(i.e.-Nubia-result of pact with Arabs(Semitic White invaders)), were, indeed, Black-MOST were NOT, being Arab(Semitic White)-please, read your history.Before Egypt(the Arab(Semitic White) given name), as it is known today, Blacks did inhabit the area, but it had not been invaded and settled by the Arabs(Semitic Whites) and given the name, Egypt,its Arabic name, again very similar to European Whites invading and settling America.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, for those who claim Cleopatra was Black, thousands of busts, drawings, paintings, and other likenesses(i.e.-coins) of her, along with written descriptions of her, from that time period, exist.One look and you can tell she is NOT Black(did not say she was Semitic White/White either,but definitely, not all ,if any, Black either), although she may possibly have some Black ancestry.<br>  <br>  The scholars seem to agree: Cleopatra was the last in a line of Ptolemies--Macedonian Greeks(Whites)--who ruled Egypt from the death of Alexander the Great in 305 B.C. until Antony's defeat in the battle of Actium in 31 B.C. The Ptolemies, as was the custom, were an incestuous, intermarrying peoples (to preserve the royal bloodline),also often having relations with the courtiers and concubines who filled their palaces. Many of the children born of these unions were given a place in the royal lineage despite being illegitimate, the secret unspoken.<br>  <br>  Many believe that Cleopatra's father was the product of such a union--his mother may have been a concubine from Nubia(Black) or Alexandria(White). Lending credence to this theory is the fact that Cleopatra's bond to the people of Egypt seemed greater than those of her Ptolemic ancestors, who aligned themselves culturally and linguistically with Greece. <br>  <br>  Yes, as I acknowledged, BEFORE the pyramids, Arab(Semitic Whites) invasions, and Egypt identity, Blacks did populate the area.Technically, Egypt did not exist, so those Blacks are really not ancient Egyptians any more than the American Indians can be called ancient Americans.Show me any kind of scientific proof that Blacks(not including slave labor),and, NOT, Arabs(Semitic Whites) built the pyramids.<br>  <br>  An even better question might be,why do so many Blacks want to claim and insist, Egypt, a majority Arab(Semitic White), Arab culture, food, music, identity, and pyramid building as their own against all factual evidence instead of hearasy? Black Heritage has much Ancient art work an herbal medicines they can rightfully claim as their own rather than trying to claim Arab(Semitic White) Heritage.<br>  <br>  From the time of the pyramid building Egypt has retained about 65% Arab(Semitic White) majority, 35% Black/Black admixture,Indian, and Asian ratios.Anything prior to that, was an area populated by Blacks, but not labeled Egypt(an Arabic name) hence, not really Ancient Egypt or Architects of the pyramids.<br>  <br>  Arabs(Semitic Whites) and Blacks ARE two different peoples despite many racists(including many Blacks) wanting to claim otherwise-totally different food, cultures, music, physical characteristics(ethnic characteristics)-side by side, the differences are readily apparent.Why many Blacks insist, contrary to evidence, Arabs are Black, I do not understand.Being swarthy alone, does not make it so, any more than Indians, Asians or any other swarthy ethinicity would make it so. <br>  <br>  MODERN ETHNIC SAMPLINGS OF ARAB(SEMITIC WHITES) COMPARED TO BLACKS<br>  <br>  Arab(Semitic Whites) Americans: Lebanese heritage: Ralph Nader, Jamie Farr(Clinger on Mash), and the late Danny Thomas.<br>  <br>  Arab( Semitic White) Americans: Egyptian heritage: Dina Powell, Rami Malek<br>  <br>  compared to:<br>  <br>  MIXED: half Arab(Semitic White)-Egyptian/half Black(Sudanese): Anwar Sadat and King Tut<br>  <br>  Black Americans: Bill Cosby, Denzel Washington, and Will Smith<br>  <br>  Clearly, you can tell the sets of men and one woman, do NOT fit in the same ethnic classification.The late Anwar Sadat, was half Arab (Semitic White)-Egyptian and half Black(Sudanese), many of the same features attributed to King Tut, whom most likely, was also bi-racial.<br>  <br>  When Blacks and Egyptians(Semitic Whites) intermarry, Black traits do dominate(i.e.-Anwar Sadat-(Egyptian Semitic White Father-Black Sudanese mother)).<br>  <br>  Homo sapiens idaltu, (similar to modern Blacks/N*egroid features) whom had Black features and Cro Magnon(similar to modern Whites/Caucasoid features) whom had White features, lived in Africa about the same time-both forms of Homo sapiens, now extinct-modern humans are a subspecies of Homo sapiens-Homo sapiens sapiens to be exact-so you can not say the first humans were Black or White.Also, the indigenous(originating there) peoples of Maghreb(the term is generally applied to all of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, but in older Arabic usage pertained only to the area of the three countries between the high ranges of the Atlas Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea). are classified as Aboriginal Caucasoid(resembling/<br>  appearing White/Caucasian).<br>  <br>  The Hamitic THEORY is outdated by DNA testing(haploid groups) and anthropological measurements.The Hamic people have been portrayed from Black to White(Semitic and/or Indo European Aryan) to an admixture. <br>  <br>  HELPFUL LINKS:<br>    <br>  <a href="http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpress.com/2008/07/22/the-faces-of-ancient-egypt/" rel="nofollow">http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpre...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/enbp/pbs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/enbp/pbs.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_africa/v032/32.1keita.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gates" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gat...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catchpenny.org/race.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catchpenny.org/race.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/RaceOfAncientEgypt.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/R...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/12/13/where-the-ancient-egyptians-black-or-white/" rel="nofollow">http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/...</a>  ***FAITH,THANKS FOR COPYING AND PASTING THIS IN YOUR EARLIER QUESTION*** -  SEE FAITH'S COPY: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://connection.ebscohost.com/content/article/1030876701.html;jsessionid=F297D4F420700ED29340B14CB" rel="nofollow">http://connection.ebscohost.com/content/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.egypt-tehuti.org/articles/egypt-bible-similarities.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.egypt-tehuti.org/articles/egy...</a>|`|4eKo5nxkaa	I have been to Egypt as well.

So I say unto you "Slave to Allah (Muslimah)" back away from because Jesus is lord. (Romans 10:9). (I am not saying that you are satanic, but your claim is deception, kinda like the serpent who tricked Eve by saying "you surly will not die" Im trying to bring humor seriously lol)<br>  <br>  But love, We do follow Christ, Jesus says “I and the Father are one.” (John 10:30)<br>  “…He who has seen Me has seen the Father.” (John 14:9)<br>   Jesus says outright “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I AM.” (John 8:58) <br>  <br>  Romans 10:9 That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.<br>  <br>  The Holy Trinity is ONE GOD, We are not praising and praying to Jesus and God we only praising God because Jesus is God born of the Holy Sprit.

John 1:1-14 says "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God.......(verse 14)the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us". This verse and book helped tremendously, we should not look at what the scripture does not say but at what it does it say. God word (The bible) is very clear and concise and should not be interpreted, God is clear confusion-less He does not lie, He does not deceive, He does not contradict Himself. <br>  <br>  Lawyers find loopholes, Jesus gives truth.|`|v2B1UuMpaa	So Called 'Christians' who do not follow God are not Christians at all. but everyone does make mistakes, and just because someone is a christian, and does something that is not of God, does not make him a bad person, we are only human.

BO3KBsPIaa	No, i think its ridiculous that all this fuss is made about wearing a hijab! I agree with you and think that they can be gorgeous. I watched a tv programme about muslims in dubai, and there was so many shops with pretty layered silk hijabs, that i almost considered becoming a muslim myself lol. It is doing no-one any harm. If someone wants to show the world that they are religous and dedicated to ytheir faith then so what? Its not a big deal, and the media should concentrate their attention on more important things. <br>  <br>  I think that some people thikn that the hijab is like a big neon sign saying "im different, and i dont want to fit into your culture", but ive had a few aquantances at college who are really ince girls, and it isnt the case at all. I think that not learning the language, honour killings and being disgusted by english culture (like going out and drinking) is what makes some people of other faiths disliked. I think theh media feel that to say this would be a bit racist, so they focus on one think and go on and on about it. Its doing nothing but inciting racial hatred.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, oi think the burka is horrible. Especially the ones with the screen that covers up the eyes. I could not talk to a person if i couldnt see their eyes, it would be weird. Most of a conversation is facial expresions, body language and tone of voice (which is muffled by the matirial). It makes me uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  There is no diference between a habit and a hijab!|`|lwXEK969aa	If you live in a country where certain items of clothing that cover the face are banned such as balaclavas etc. then yes muslims head scarfs should be banned, however, it would be wrong just to ban muslim head scarfs and not other similar concealing head gear.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	I do not believe in restricting something like clothing. And particularly clothing worn as a cultural or religious act.|`|xdF08Uqfaa	They banned hoodies in some shopping centres,so I don't see why not,do you?|`|X3PmWPUraa	No, after all, we allow roman catholic nuns to wear their habbits etc - OK, that's only so we can hear them coming and run fast!!!  It is up to the individual to choose what they want to wear.  If there was a ban on skinny boys wearing jeans 5 sizes too big with their bums hanging out, yep, i'd sign up for a ban on that!!!!|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	Yes, I do. Such attire has nothing in common with our traditions and has no place here. I don't want my country to resemble a foreign country. It was quite all right the way it was.<br>  <br>  In case you didn't realise: Nuns are Christian and the religion of this country is Christianity, not islam!|`|DHCwLBuwaa	I see nothing wrong with someone choosing to wear that kind of garb.

I used to wear a Niqab but I found HIjab and Niqab too impracticle to wear, it's far more convinient for me to just tie it an a bun and not give a darn what people say in the first place (yes, yes thumbs down)<br>  <br>  But back to the question : should headscarves be banned? No. If so, ban wigs, bandanas, hairpieces in fact go the whole way back to the days of Cromwell and just ban make up altogether-if a woman is truly free and respected, she'll wear what she wants regardless of what it covers. But in cases of identity photos or workplaces where features such as the face need to be shown, common sense needs to be used and we shouldn't have to face another article in the newspaper about a woman kicking up a big fuss because she wasn't allowed to wear her Niqab, extra long jubaah or gloves. If she wishes to be treated the same as others, then she'll need to blend in to a certain extent otherwise, go elsewhere where she can freely wear completely what she wants. It's the same with nudists and scantily clad girls. You'd wear a bikini on the beach, pyjamas at home and ten inch heels in a club otherwise poeple will look at you funny.|`|0yTM98Odaa	No course not but I agree with BooNaaNaa on the security thing, cause I mean everyone has to go through security and take their shoes off etc.|`|0KR4wyoQaa	no way, or isn't there freedom of religion?

AA12070800	The Hebrew Bible was written primarily by Jews for the Jewish community, and the books in the Hebrew Bible cover hundreds of years.

Guinness also brews Harp Lager beer and Smithwicks Ale. (Stouts, Ales and Lagers are all types of beer and their distinctive characteristics are based upon the ingredients used and the particular methods used in the brewing process).  The Guinness Brewery was established in 1759 at St James Gate, Dublin Ireland.<br>  <br>  Most of its popularity in the USA is probably due to marketing, and the  fact that it is so closely associated with the Irish on St Patrick's Day. (One of the marketing gimmicks is the use of the harp in the trademark - Arthur Guinness & Sons deliberately chose the harp symbol as its logo or symbol to appeal to nationalist pride in Ireland. The harp is also a symbol of Ireland., which appears on the back of their coinage.

j2TcaHg1aa	Solve poverty in your own country first.<br>  <br>  Stop helping Africa, Africa is not asking for your help.<br>  <br>  You are cluless about what you are talking about.<br>  Sorry to break it down to you. No, you are not helping Africa. You are just trying to boost your low self esteem so that you can feel your life worthy. Get some education and know that you are absolutely not helping Africa but sending some food and clothes or what have you to solve malaria. If you were educated enough, I would call you hypocritcal, but you are not. If you really want to help Africa, you should buy what africans produce. That's the only way people can pull themselves up. It grinds my gear to constantly hear westerners cry all the time how badly they want to help Africa, but yet, they dont mind putting all the trade barriers to african products. Africa will be better off without you, keep your dollar/euro in your country and let us breath and build our continent. But, no you cant. As always, you have to create a mess everywhere on this planet.<br>  <br>  If you really want to help Africa, you should be talking to your government to stop intervening in African affairs, sending mercenaries to Africa to create chaos and profit from it.<br>  If you really want to help Africa, you should stop consuming the propaganda about how poor Africa is or how people live in a slum there. The images you are referring to, I can go to your country and recreate exaclty the same thing or even worst to show a bad image of your people.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I can go on forever why should not send a penny to Africa because you have seen a video about poor people. These videos are made for one purpose: to boost your self esteem so that you can fel better about your life. And apparently, the videos are doing a wonderful job.<br>  Do you want to get educated about Africa? Pay a visit, or watch the african channel on cable tv or online, talk to real africans. Stop consumming the hatred perpetrated by the media.<br>  <br>  Addtionnal info: look, I did not have to spend that much time to find example of people who need help just here in USA. CNN is reporting that 1.5 million children are homeless here. Instead of crying how you want to help people in Africa, why dont you go and help this little american blond? <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/03/10/homeless.children/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/03/10/homeles...</a> ?<br>  <br>  No, you wont because that does not give you the same fulfillment, the same sense of ego boosting mantra. <br>  <br>  You would rather go around and spread the idea of a dying, helpless Africa without realizing how bad your attitude affects the revival of the continent's economy. Enough, is enough!|`|9n4MpLwvaa	75% of that continent is above the poverty line.

You can religiously decree to kill people and that ain't good.<br>  However, Christian living is good.  If you are a genuine Christian which is a follower of Christ; such as His disciples and Apostles were then that is good and you will not do things bad nor harmful to others.  We do not have Jesus Christ on earth to follow in person so you follow Him by reading, understanding, and doing what He would have you to do in His Word (the Holy Bible); unaltered in any form. (including modern translations)  <br>  I am a firm believer in Christian Faith such as I described above.  I do not believe in talking the talk if you are not walking the walk.  I  do not believe every one who calls themselves Christian are so.  Without prejudice, I must add here I do not believe the JW religion nor the Mormons are Christian. (that is just my opinion so don't get excited)<br>  I have reason(s) for that thinking and it is long involved study of their doctrine(s).  I find it repulsive for people or organizations to call themselves Christian and there is not any Christian "Fruit of the Spirit" in evidence in their lives.  You know a maple tree by the leaves (they are very different from an ash tree) and so should you recognize a true Christian by the Fruit of the Spirit.  A real Christian person should never have to announce their belief - it should show.  I can walk into a persons home and know if they live a Christian life or not and I never ask.  It just isn't necessary.<br>  I would add that the majority on here would make a Christian want to give it up or at least call them selves something else.  They say they are Christian and then berate their fellow man. Not showing any Fruit of a Christian life - are they?  This is a long sermon, but I will close now.

It essentially dictates to a person how to think,  for some of the weak willed people who are unable to establish authority over their own thoughts it is exceptionally well at establishing an exterior authority.  <br>  <br>  But, such thoughts can be detrimental to society.  They can be harmful to others who do not process life in the same manner as the religion dictates.  Indeed, some of the thoughts processes of Christianity requires that doubt not be fully explored, as such is an act of sin.  Such perceived sin that others are seen to be doing is often times met with Christianity in harmful ways.<br>  <br>  For most of us, such exterior authority is not needed.  We have the will to live a moral life with our own will power, the benefits of which is we are not restricted in our thought.  We are able to adapt,as doubt is not prohibited.|`|MgBrUZxiaa	Yes.

They are NOT supposed to be equivalent, even though many agnostics think like atheists in denying that which they claim to not know one way or the other about.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Agnosticism covers a broad range of beliefs, such as belief there is a God, but we will never know the nature of God, to believing there is something beyond the physical, and, again, believing that it is beyond our ability to rationally understand and explain.<br>  <br>  Agnostics are open to finding the truth about higher power wherever it may be found.|`|hYzfzu9yaa	If an agnostic was an atheist, they would be called atheists.|`|W0qNkROpaa	Agnostics think that the existence of God can never be proven or disproven.  So they can be atheists or theists.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	No, Agnostics say they don't know and then have a go at everyone else.

wgOzHizAaa	St.Patrick was born in Britain to wealthy parents near the end of the fourth century. His father was a Christian Deacon but it is suggested he took the role for the tax incentives and the is no evidence that he came from a particularly religious family. <br>  <br>  When Patrick was 16 he was taken captive by a group of Irish raiders. They transported him to Ireland and Patrick was a prisoner for a little over 6 years. Lonely and afraid he turned to his religion for solace, becoming a devout Christian. One night Patrick believed that God spoke to him in a dream, telling him it was time for him to leave Ireland. <br>  <br>  After Patrick returned to England he claimed to have another dream, telling him to return to Ireland as a missionary. Soon after Patrick began religious training, a course of study that lasted more than 15 years. After his ordination as a priest, he was sent to Ireland with a dual mission; to minister Christians that were already living there and to convert the Irish. <br>  <br>  Familiar with the Irish language and culture, Patrick chose to incorporate traditional ritual into his lessons of Christianity instead of attempting to eradicate native Irish beliefs. For instance, he used bonfires to celebrate Easter since the Irish were used to honoring their gods with fire. He also superimposed a sun, a powerful Irish symbol, onto the Christian cross to create what is now called a Celtic cross, so that veneration of the symbol would seem more natural to the Irish.<br>  <br>  St. Patrick's Day is celebrated on March 17, his religious feast day and the anniversary of his death in the fifth century. The Irish have observed this day as a religious holiday for over a thousand years.<br>  <br>  On St. Patrick's Day, which falls during the Christian season of Lent, Irish families would traditionally attend church in the morning and celebrate in the afternoon. Lenten prohibitions against the consumption of meat were waived and people would dance, drink, and feast—on the traditional meal of Irish bacon and cabbage.<br>  <br>  The first St. Patrick's Day parade took place not in Ireland, but in the United States. Irish soldiers serving in the English military marched through New York City on March 17, 1762. Along with their music, the parade helped the soldiers to reconnect with their Irish roots, as well as fellow Irishmen serving in the English army.<br>  <br>  Over the next thirty-five years, Irish patriotism among American immigrants flourished, prompting the rise of so-called "Irish Aid" societies, like the Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick and the Hibernian Society. Each group would hold annual parades featuring bagpipes (which actually first became popular in the Scottish and British armies) and drums.<br>  <br>  In 1848, several New York Irish aid societies decided to unite their parades to form one New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade. Today, that parade is the world 's oldest civilian parade and the largest in the United States, with over 150,000 participants.<br>  <br>  Each year, nearly three million people line the one-and-a-half mile parade route to watch the procession, which takes more than five hours. Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Savannah also celebrate the day with parades including between 10,000 to 20,000 participants.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	St.Patrick brought Christianity to Ireland & the reason for the Shamrock is because He used it to teach about the Blessed Trinity using the 3 leaves Green is for the Emerald Isle  the Leprechaun is a symbol of the myth of the Wee people that is Irish folklore So Saint Patrick became the Patron Saint of Ireland  I hope this helps Slainte (cheers & health) to you|`|AA10370541	Did you know you're the first person to ask this?

QE2hNXeCaa	Personally, I don't think its okay to dress up as Osama Bin Laden either, it's just not funny. I think it is because Nazi war crimes are some of the most horrific things that have occurred in history.9/11 is a tragedy,there is no question about it, but there was not human experimentation, gas chambers,starvation or typhus epidemics involved.It isn't a competition about who suffers the most and how many people die on the upcoming tragedy but also a matter of memory.Nazi Germany seems like a more sinister and cruel scenario because it was the mood of the time, the discovery of the gas chambers and the great number of general war casualties make even present generations feel afraid and the way to cope with loss at that time was through silence and turning the figure of Hitler into a form of devil that must not be evoked.In the case of Osama Bin Laden and the war in Afghanistan the way many Americans have chosen to cope is through humor and ridicule of the Taliban. Just look around the internet, there are cartoons of Bin Laden everywhere.Same on television. There has also been some serious slandering of the Muslim world to accompany our need for security and symbolic revenge. The stereotypes of Arabic people have flourished to make other Americans feel like we are in power. So in short after such a ramble this is what I think: there are two different ways of coping with the past, remembering it all the time until it becomes a movie in our heads, like 9/11 or mystifying it and only speaking about it in whispers, like we have done with the crimes of WWII.|`|JRRsjByCaa	well seeing as Hitler set up concentration camps to not only wipe out the Jews but many other races seeing as he saw Whites as the master race, that would be a HUGE reason why its not okay to dress as Hitler.|`|AA10214265	I personally don't think either is appropriate. But perhaps its because Hitler was responsible for a larger number of deaths targeted at primarily a single group.|`|6836b0842e51a3f377c842c52770f18baa	i  have  no  idea|`|NyLD8lAiaa	Because Osama Bin Laden is a freedom fighter, while Hittler slaughtered millions of jews...apparantly|`|AA11558033	dressing up as nazi = not cool + not funny<br>  dressing up as terrorist = not cool + not funny|`|g2R7e2eVaa	I could really care less.

GEIuZ2ivaa	I would consider that tacky. If you can't afford to send a picture to everyone, then don't put anything in there....send the picture via e-mail if you want people to see your family or kids or whatever. To me that sounds like "you're not important enough to receive a real picture, so here, you get one off the cutting room floor"....|`|9e7f34ca42b0bc7a01f44825b1539e5eaa	I think the whole sending pictures of your family in a card is just tacky in general , as would be the photocopied version lol|`|nRFZwdN4aa	Lol that was funny. It is tacky.|`|MMCaaZFyaa	LOL at Tiff's answer..<br>  <br>  Yes it is tacky!!! Seriously.....people are stupid.|`|lk03YYPEaa	I'd consider it to be tacky, yes.<br>  I know I'd probably be a little offended if I received a picture like that, just in black and white on printer paper. It's like saying, "I've sent the original copies to the people I thought of first, but I guess you can have this one -- I copied it at FedEx for 5 cents." :/<br>  <br>  But if you know that the person who sent it isn't able to afford regular copies, don't be upset.|`|RF1jX2ZVaa	Its tacky. But maybe that's all they could afford too! I wish someone would send me a real picture. Best wishes.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	I've gotten a few like that and it didn't seem tacky to me. Sending pics to all the friends and relatives can get expensive, so a photo copy on plain paper is the logical thing to do if you just want to show everyone how much the kids have grown or something like that.

pleQaMxVaa	Well, I'm a guy so I really can't say how lesbian/bi girls work lol. But, I think whenever they get close to you, it is a sign... period... First, you need to find out if she's interested in girls too. So, you befriend her, join clubs, go hang out at the mall or catch a movie... whatever... Then, eventually bring up the subject of homo/bisexuality. See her opinions on it, and if she's okay with it, come out to her. Things will fall into place from there...|`|kkVHXm1Kaa	i think its in your head. maybe she is just touchy feely in general.|`|gkQGNuSzaa	It's difficult to determine an individuals sexuality without approaching them and directly asking them.<br>  <br>  Assuming your position.<br>  <br>  I would not personally base assumptions on such presumptuous instances.<br>  <br>  Of course, this does not completely eliminate the possibility of her feeling somewhat attracted to you.<br>  <br>  To a lesser extent.<br>  <br>  Until you actually receive some major significations.<br>  You should probably refrain from thinking as such.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, take care.|`|UKtRES03aa	well is she bi too?

The love of the Father is not in those who love the world;16for all that is in the world-- the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, the pride in riches-- comes not from the Father but from the world.17And the world and its desire are passing away, but those who do the will of God live forever.|`|bUDOZFDAaa	i once asked am i lazy because i do less and achieve the same if not better results. <br>  <br>  the answer no you are smart|`|L9qsOtkZaa	Nowadays people think there is a moral obligation to work and get a pay check.

I feel sorry for you because you seem like a sad person and I hope one day you find peace in life.  Please feel grateful for the life you have.  I have been through so much trauma the last few years, so I am grateful of the life I have (its not ideal like other peoples, but I can hold my head high knowing I am a good person),  and not jealous of others.

grYkoDaraa	i think it does a little i think that if you have sex too soon then the relationship turns more to a sexual relationship but if you wait and get to know each other then it is so much more than just sex.|`|KszocgnSaa	Probably. Lol. Depends on the people I guess.|`|AA11488745	In most cases it does.|`|sLgI3cRpaa	to some extent yes|`|M1yfrNgDaa	yes because it might be what the other person is just looking for. and if you give it up to them right away the relationship might just end. but if you wait then you both might really end up liking each other a lot to not just want sex in the relationship. and the sex might be better when your having it with someone you really care for.|`|bd89db95a8636a616e42896cf49b6a87aa	"Too early," yes.  But what is too early?  The first month?  The first week?  The first day?<br>  <br>  What "too early" means all depends on the relationship and the people in it.|`|o3SB4H11aa	It mostly depends on the people. But sometimes too early could be rushing into things and it usally doesn't end well.|`|nkMqENnaaa	Yes, because your relationship will just be based on sex.

If you do, go get help)<br>  <br>  2) You actually love him/her.

AA11032982	Of course. It just shows people will interpret the bible anyway they see fit. It's not a science book, they've told us that from day one. It's more of a morality book, but the morality of 2000 years ago or earlier. So you always have to keep that in mind.|`|aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	If scientific types can't agree on simple facts about dinosaurs (and they can't - there are as many scientific theories about dinosaurs as there are denominations), then doesn't that put the whole notion of Science and evolution into serious doubt?  Answer - No, of course it doesn't! Just because people have different ideas and disagree on a topic in no way means the topic does not exist! It actually indicates the exact opposite.<br>  <br>  So if Scientists are allowed to disagree amongst themselves whilst still upholding Science, please allow religious types the same privilege, without casting aspersions on God and Jesus.

Adam and Eve put mankind on a bad way in life but he has away out if that is what they are looking for. We have to show we know he is real and look for him. The Bible shows the way but the greater  number do not teach it aright. So people start hating all people and all religion and give up looking.

But if I look for Swiss Coffee, they have it, and it isn't even in the rainbow, or mentioned in The Bible?<br>  <br>  Doesn't that fact kinda prove that He doesn't exist?<br>  <br>  Your thoughts.<br>  Cooperation Needed<br>  Your Answer:<br>  OK I am not sure this should go here but here it is just the same because the question is funny but this is serious but many think it is funny too! Reason on it please!<br>  <br>  Best Answer - Chosen by Asker<br>  By Kj7gs:<br>  Well, as you've seen, they thanked Jehovah, they thanked themselves, kind of like their avoidance of the military that protects them.

God is about the heart not a religious ritual. God wants you to come to Him not another man. God wants you to be willing to give all for Him not a denomination.

These were Jewish historians and did not like Jesus or his followers.  But that in itself proves he existed.  We have found writings of some of the ancient people who spoke about the messiah. The "Dead Sea Scrolls" were written hundreds of years before Christ was born.  They contain almost the complete book of Isaiah.  It is almost exactly the same as the book of Isaiah we have today.  Isaiah talks about the messiah.  Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies that were written about him.<br>  <br>  Check out the writings of Pliny the Younger and Josephus.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	i think that in rome or somewhere over there they have a rag that was used to wipe jesus blood, during his death, i saw it in the news and in the discovery channel.<br>  didn't you see it?<br>  they wanted to clone it to see if they could make another jesus, and the church came out to say that even if it was possible to perfect cloning, that it would be an awful thing to do to try and clone jesus.|`|DQjAGWXQaa	There was the Bible.

There is a lot of proof of Jesus existence for sure both in text of Roman writings and religious writings of the day. The fact that people died to tell what they saw heard and believed is a big proof. For me the Schroud of Turin is a big one. It is like God gave us a picture before photography existed.<br>  Go on you tube and look it up...watch all the 5 clips. Then listen to Lee Stroble on the proof of the resturection. <br>  you should be busy... there is a  lot on you tube to see. Josh Mc dowel is another good one.|`|MM5iGrnIaa	Cornelius Tacitus mentioned him...<br>  He never  mentioned the name "Jesus" though, but he did mention a man named Christ us(Christ) that the Christians would refer to.  <br>  <br>  I don't doubt that there might be  little evidence supporting the existence of Jesus.  Why? The Roman empire saw him as a leader of rebellion;  Just speaking his name would of merited an execution.  Not only would anything that was written about him be burned, but anyone who believed in him or spoke about him  would be slaughtered.  If anything was to be written about Jesus, it would be discrete, rare, or done so many years later; which Tacitus was many years later.<br>  <br>  I believe it is safe to say that a man named "Jesus," who was a religious teacher of his time, did exist.  Lack of evidence may be due to the Romans.  However , if it wasn't for Emperor Constantine, Christianity would of died out long ago; that is fact( that is if you look into history.)|`|RhDPB70Baa	Not really.  There are three historical accounts of Jesus' existence, two of which are from hardcore christians (so they're obviously invalid) and one was written several decades after he supposedly died so the account was written entirely off of the mythos his "followers" spread.<br>  <br>  So no.|`|4NOSvnHHaa	Yes, There is numerous evidence about the existance of Christ.

Nope, nope. Sorry none.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	roman texts|`|OeVGYXhxaa	Besides the foremost source, the Bible itself, there are many other reliable sources confirming Jesus as historical. For example, there is the famous first-century historian Flavius Josephus’ testimony of the existence of Jesus as he writes: “Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles.”—Antiquities of the Jews (Book?XVIII, chap.?3, par.?3).<br>  <br>  There are also a number of prominent first-century pagan Roman writers who made mention of Christ and his followers. Among them are the historian Tacitus, the author and administrator Pliny the Younger, the biographer Suetonius, the poet Juvenal, and the stoic philosopher Lucius Seneca, who was a contemporary of Jesus and the leading intellectual figure in Rome in the middle of the first century.<br>  <br>  Concerning such early non-Christian writers, the Encyclopaedia Britannica states: “These independent accounts prove that in ancient times even the opponents of Christianity never doubted the historicity of Jesus.”—1980 edition, vol.?10, p.?145.<br>  <br>  Some object that if Jesus was such a great personage there should be more mention of him in early historical records. On this, Blaise Pascal, quoted in the column to the right, refers to Jesus as living “in such obscurity (according to what the world calls obscurity) that historians writing only of important political events hardly noticed him.”<br>  <br>  Despite this, there is an abundance of historical evidence. Even the well-known skeptic, the mission doctor Albert Schweitzer, admitted: “We have to avow that there are not many of the personalities of antiquity of whom so many indubitable historical facts and of whom so many statements have been preserved as in the case of Jesus.”<br>  <br>  The evidence is clear, Jesus Christ is a historical person. He also measured up in the qualities that make one really great. He is the greatest man in history.<br>  <br>  The more you study Jesus in detail the more convinced you will become as to his greatness|`|9BeUbORtaa	The overwhelming academic consensus is that Jesus existed. Not only is there the evidence of the Gospels and Epistles, there is the matter that, even in the period of Christian persecution in the late 1st century, nobody seems to have questioned the proposition that Jesus was a real person. This isn't "proof", exactly, but history deals with evidence, not proof. Given what evidence we have, the burden of 'proof' would - if anything - appear to be on those who would claim that, contrary to the robustly historical figure who emerges from the Biblical texts, Jesus was some kind of fabrication. This is not to say that there are not, perhaps, mythical elements in the biography of Jesus found in the Gospels. However, there are mythical aspects (including divine conception) in the Hellenistic biographies of Alexander the Great as well. This does not mean that Alexander never existed. <br>  <br>  Bill Maher is quite an amusing television host, but he's not a great scholar.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	An empty tomb<br>  <br>  Works for me.....|`|dtrYjyYZaa	Faith needs no proof|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	If you believe the bible.

wixLFCsuaa	In today's world we have High Priests all over. We have the ones that want feel-good religion without the preaching of sin and repentance. We have the leaders who preach prosperity and a twisted view on success. We have leaders who blasphemy God with their teachings on works and playing down what Jesus did on the Cross. Then we have the Catholic priests who have no right to hear our sin and give us pennance (sorry, spelled wrong but it's been years since I went to a Catholic church). Then we have the Jesuits who want to infiltrate our colleges and churches and any other high office to stop the true gospel. It's not good. Scary if you really think about it, but God is still on the throne.|`|5vqo3XzHaa	It tells me how powerful the Gospel of Jesus Christ is when we are bold in proclaiming it to others.|`|7eb1e90849f4b135c41291426e9941d1aa	"We must obey God rather than men!"  That sums it up for me.

My brazilian friend did say that brazil was adangerous place for tourists that get out of the area, unless they know people from there.

Try talking to someone about it because it seems like there may be some other underlying emotional issues.|`|EYqTV2EYaa	Are you referring to the Columbine High School massacre? If so, I had the same problem when I first heard about it. It creeped me out from imagining someone shooting other students at school, and it never entered my mind before.|`|hxXaB5kFaa	Talk about it. Get a friend to mention it so you will get depressed and at that moment speak all your thoughts to him or her. So you can lift the burden off your chest. If that fails then please see a psychologist.<br>  <br>  Unless you are affected by it throught family or loved ones- I don't really see why it takes such a hold of you (even though the same scenerio did happen in several universities). There are many people around the world dieing because of many causes and some are probably so disturbing that it may seem much worse in comparision to columbine but still try to do what I said.|`|AA10293793	sounds like you are clinically depressed, and should go see a doctor.|`|dZqZjewvaa	stop watching TV hun. Oddly enough the one thing that would prevent something like that from ever happening would be if everyone carried a gun......weird huh?
rPYai1aMaa	Um...most straight guys I know "slap boys butts" or do "gay weird things" to each other as a sort of joke.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry, if this is all he's doing, he's probably not gay.|`|1uy2slguaa	Has he told you that he has an attraction to boys?  If he has, he is definitly gay.  By the way, just because he is dating you doesn't mean he is straight.  There are married men with kids who are gay!!! I'm a lesbian so I don't know how anyone can live a lie like that, but that's none of my biz.  Best thing to do is to confront him about it.  You could say something like; "Hey, what's up with you waxing your eyebrows, most guys don't do that?  Is that your way of trying to stay hot for me?"  You can also reassure him also (if you and he are super close) by telling him that if he is into guys then there is nothing wrong with that and you will support him either way.<br>  <br>  But, girl trust me!  Communication is key!  Many great relationships and best friendships have ended badly because of a miscommunication or a lack of communication.  Good Luck! *smiles*|`|HGV6kejtaa	Some guys do that stuff. I am a guy and I don't do it, but see people do that stuff all the time at school and other places. I have had some guys slap my butt, put their arm around me and pulled my close, slap my stomach, and rub my tit. That is just some guys for you. That is things that I have had done to me by other guys. That is just in some guys for you. |`|8mfFWUZpaa	no he's not i slap guys arses but i play rugby league and when we score tries we all slap each others arses, and no im not gay|`|Z5slkmboaa	Will look at this way if your boy friend is gay, you get two guys in stead of one.|`|AUEWTORQaa	Could just be immature |`|2e947beed501add14d90fe011678502baa	Yep, he's gay alright.|`|uC4SKsEeaa	SO DOES MY GUY BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE HIM GAY, IT JUST MAKES HIM DIFFERENT  TRY TALKING TO HIM.

Does he rub butts with an openly gay man in public or only slap them? My bf does this kind of thing to. At least he did. Until I gave him intimate details on gay butt sex. He's never touched a guy since. Haha.|`|VCZyEcYNaa	no, guys are very gay lol, inn 17 with all straight friends, half the time they're slapping each others arses..ever seen guys from an all boys school? ever heard of sack tapping?|`|bYXz6xJcaa	ummmm, could be!

B3OK4K4gaa	Let me quote a line from the movie Robocop "I'd buy that for a dollar!"|`|26cb6190c99a848bb4c18aed374707c0aa	And he died a failure.<br>  |`|XTyAMS5yaa	I really couldn't say it better myself to be honest.|`|g65tuqwRaa	Religions keeps common people quiet because religions tells them how to live their lives. Religion can be twisted in any form you please. Knowing that there is a higher being (to the common folk) and knowing that you would be punished for bad deeds, the head of the religion can make up any rules and say "if you don't follow this, you go to hell"<br>  <br>  Fair Bear: I think that would fall under what I've just explained. If people are willing to 'take over the world' based on their religion, then they are following based on what a higher up has told them to do.|`|71c6c3d26be7dbca2bd5e204e344e5f6aa	The man was an idiot.  Religion does not keep the common people quiet....just look at Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Palestine.  And of course, don't forget the Islamic movement throughout the UK and Europe and their hope to dominate the world.|`|9lyWMSHDaa	I think that quote sums up religion right there. No need for anymore explaining really.|`|AA10293793	he is absolutely correct.|`|qC7VVXpwaa	I believe that many here have the right idea about what Napoleon meant.  That religion, itself, was an excellent way to keeping the common people quiet. <br>  <br>  But being the genius that he was, that answer does not delve deep enough.  I personally believe that as you surpass others through knowledge, understanding and even more-so a thirst to understand all that you have knowledge of, that you become less reliant on answers from a "god" figure.  <br>  <br>  For someone who was as smart as him, I believe that this quote was more directed at the idea that he did not need a god in order to push forward and to continue his domination both militaristic and political, that his own will had propelled him.|`|4fa8yivSaa	Napoleon, who first rejected religion and even banished the Catholic Church, eventually reinstated the church because of the outcry from the common people. With his statement he means, that by giving the people a false hope, it is easy to control them.  By twisting their beliefs into his plan, Napoleon could persuade his people much easier.|`|JN0TCcoraa	Religion is a way to control people. All Napolean needed to do was threaten people with Hell and they would do whatever he wanted. I mean, think about it- if you were uneducated and very religious and Nappy comes along and tells you that he will lead you to salvation but the King would lead you to Hell... well, what would you do?|`|G1nPkwivaa	You can justify any deed in the name of religion and most people will agree with you|`|acc3ff4b078a08ae78be3d669658a55baa	I love that quote.  It's so true.<br>  |`|0a483cb5cfa8e1bdf5e5f918465d603aaa	As a commander he was brilliant and he had an uncanny understanding of people and warfare.  "Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet".  Though I am not familiar with this particular quote, it does however reflect his certain... style.  It is unfortunate that "religion" has been abused as it has, but he would be correct in his analysis.  During his time, religion was a dominating factor and many superstitions had developed because of distortions of the gospel.  Religious power was world dominating at this time and was common practice for controlling the general public.  To create a state of fear among the people created money for the "Catholic church" and other political figures.<br>  <br>  Another such quote, "the enemy of my enemy is my friend".  He knew the wisdom of harnessing the power of other forces such as military power, other than his own to conquer a certain enemy. 
iwI435eVaa	I don't think it would matter if the boy was gay or straight. I think whatever a guys sexual preference is, they think about sex. Now bi guys, hmm maybe they might think of sex more frequently since they like both sexes, lol?|`|4ZaAZgCgaa	I don't think this is an answerable question. Unless someone one could read minds??????   THAT WOULD BE F*CK!N CRAZY!!!!!!!|`|UbvglIS6aa	No gay people don't think about sex either more or less often than straight people.|`|W8iDn9hhaa	NO, u know how guys are, guys and those HORMONES!

A lot if females are too embarrassed to say how much they think about it because it's not "ladylike".

yoRrlaPRaa	Michael Richards better known as Kramer <br>  <br>  from TVs Seinfeld does make a good point. <br>  <br>  This was his defense speech in court after making racial comments <br>  <br>  in his comedy act. He makes some very interesting points... <br>  <br>  Someone finally said it... How many are actually paying attention <br>  <br>  to this? There are African Americans, Mexican Americans, Asian <br>  <br>  Ameri cans, Arab Americans, etc. And then there are just Ameri- <br>  <br>  cans. You pass me on the street and sneer in my direction. You call <br>  <br>  me 'White boy,' 'Cracker,' 'Honkey,' 'Whitey,' 'Caveman' ... and <br>  <br>  t hat's OK. <br>  <br>  But when I call you, ******, Kike, Towel head, Sand-******, Camel <br>  <br>  Jockey, Beaner, ****, or Chink ... You call me a racist. You say that <br>  <br>  whites commit a lot of violence against you... so why are the ghettos <br>  <br>  the most dangerous places to live? <br>  <br>  You have the United Negro College Fund. You have Martin Luther <br>  <br>  King Day. You have Black History Month. You have Cesar Chavez <br>  <br>  Day. You have Yom Hashoah. You have Ma'uled Al-Nabi. You have <br>  <br>  the NAACP. You have BET... If we had WET (White Entertainment <br>  <br>  Television), we'd be racists. If we had a White Pride Day, you would <br>  <br>  call us racists. If we had White History Month, we'd be racists. <br>  <br>  If we had any organization for only whites to 'advance' <br>  <br>  OUR , lives we'd be racists. <br>  <br>  We have a Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, a Black Chamber of <br>  <br>  Commerce, and then we just have the plain Chamber of Commerce. <br>  <br>  Wonder who pays for that?? <br>  <br>  A white woman could not be in the Miss Black American pageant, <br>  <br>  but any color can be in the Miss America pageant. <br>  <br>  If we had a college fund that only gave white students scholarships <br>  <br>  ... You know we'd be racists. <br>  <br>  There are over 60 openly proclaimed Black Colleges in the US . <br>  <br>  Yet if there were 'White colleges' That would be a racist college. <br>  <br>  In the Million Man March, you believed that you were marching <br>  <br>  for your race and rights. <br>  <br>  If we marched for our race and rights, you would call us racists. <br>  <br>  You are proud to be black, brown, yellow and orange, <br>  <br>  and you're not afraid to announce it. <br>  <br>  But when we announce our white pride, you call us racists. <br>  <br>  You rob us, carjack us, and shoot at us. But, when a white police <br>  <br>  officer shoots a black gang member or beats up a black drug- <br>  <br>  dealer running from the law and posing a threat to society, you <br>  <br>  call him a racist. <br>  <br>  I am proud...

ybbI1vLyaa	Obviously, this isn't right. The Jesus who we true Christians know told us to "honour your mother and father". A 'Jesus' who thinks your parents are "cheap" and "don't love you" obviously isn't the Jesus that told us that our parents are God's representative and is all-knowing. <br>  <br>  You know what? If that church put up a page like that, I wouldn't trust the rest of it. And I had a further look. I DON'T trust any of it. It's not legit. <br>  <br>  Be careful. <br>  <br>  What God means by this verse:<br>  <br>      "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother...he cannot be my disciple."  - The Lord Jesus Christ   (Luke 14:26)<br>  <br>  Is that your love for God should be so great that your love for your parents and siblings should be like hate in comparison.|`|TYstsM7Yaa	Lol i seen this before, it cracked me up.

GHdscZ2Haa	If the T&Cs of the job require certain actions, or qualifications then that is what the job requires.    If you sign up to those T&Cs in the contract then you are bound by them.<br>  <br>  <br>  For example, a single boss having sex with his single assistant in the office behind closed doors is not illegal, but it is grounds for dismissal in most companies.<br>  <br>  <br>  If a Baptist church has a position open for a preacher, then it is no use a rabbi complaining that he was not offered the position.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now, if these people's contracts did not include the relevant termination clauses then the employer is in the wrong.   If those clauses are there then the employer has to show good reason why they are there.  Saying I have to be a Catholic is not going to fly if it is a job as a plumber.

AA11232725	Both of those categories have to do with "sins of the heart". It's what's going on in a person's heart that constitutes the sin and not the activities them self.<br>  <br>  For instance, a person could have a job where they assign ratings to movies and part of their job could involve watching pornography. If they are looking at the movie like a doctor might examine a nude patient in order to make a diagnosis, then they are not committing the sin of adultery or fornication in their heart.<br>  <br>  If a person is playing a violent video game and they know that they are just moving animated characters around on a screen and they enjoy the visual effects then it's no different from a person who is playing monopoly and they wouldn't really try to bankrupt people and take their houses from them.<br>  <br>  So, in both cases it's what is going on in the heart of a person involved in those activities. Are they harboring sinful thoughts that they would put into practice in real life? Most people who watch pornography would have to answer "yes" to that question. As to the video games, I think that the percentage would be much lower.<br>  <br>  Still, if a person finds them self getting excited about committing violent acts even in a game setting, then they might want to examine their heart and see if there is something that needs to be repented of.|`|tJGbfxdgaa	porn is worse in MY eyes...<br>  but i think they're all equal to God.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	The consequenses of the pornography will be much worse.|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	There are no sins worse than others.

Some of the people are in it by choice but due to its marginalized position in society, organized crime and drug abuse play a major part.

There are consequences that can be worse than other consequences. If you sow a bad seed such as pornography, then you dilute your thinking with impure thoughts of women/men and sex in general. Sex is suppose to be pure and innocent done between husband and wife who are in love. This is the gift God has given married couples. It will be hard for someone to accomplish this holy union when pornography has taken away the innocence of what sex should be. Nowadays, people don't want to wait until marriage, or if they are married, they want to add a third person, or add other things to their sex life that God would be displease with. Pornography is a sin that is never satisfied, and only put one's life toward a downward spiral.<br>  <br>  Violent video games on the other hand does have an affect on how you think too. It can desensitize your feelings toward people and things that happen in general. God wants us to be sensitive to the things such as violence (seeing it that it is bad to harm any living creature). This is why so many people don't have much remorse when they see violence in the media. So both sins are harmful to one's thinking and soul. There is no sin greater than the other. As in James, you break one law, you break them all.|`|ZjSgawcpaa	Porn.|`|Rc9SNllPaa	The level of the sin is dependent upon the amount of knowledge the performer has of the action that is being performed. <br>  One who knows he is doing wrong gets a reaction which is greater than one who is in ignorance. One who knows he is doing wrong but does not care in the least and is very rebellious, get an even greater reaction.<br>  One who has no knowledge that he is performing a sinful act gets the least reaction.<br>  Pornography is far more degrading to the mind and intelligence so therefore holds a greater degree of reaction in general. <br>  Take care and best wishes always<br>  GOURANGA GOURANGA GOURANGA|`|AA11389157	According to the Bible (not me), all sins are equal. According to the Bible (not me), the penalty for all sin is death, and according to the Bible (not me) there is not one person on earth who is free of sin. According to the Bible (not me) there is only one sin that is worse than any other sin - and it is only worse because it is unforgiveable, according to Jesus Himself - and that, according to the Bible (not me) is the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  Rev.

This is because people are, as a rule, ******* hypocrites. <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think either is a grave sin, although I find it easier to understand people who prefer pornography. I'm mystified by people who think that taking pleasure from sexual images is somehow more damaging or more 'defiling' than taking pleasure from violent images. How so??<br>  <br>  I'm also confused by the argument that all sins are equal. This hardly seems like a Christian argument, and is certainly unscriptural.
0c63fdd0630be2f6cbd717d497ab2474aa	Mandatory goes against one of the most basic founding principles of this country: freedom of religion.<br>  Voluntary is allowed, and should be allowed. Not allowing it would also go against freedom of religion. (The problem only comes in when teacher are leading the "voluntary" prayers, because that can be seen as coercive. But there's nothing wrong with students choosing to pray by themselves).|`|FfxmE9Toaa	See Abington vs. Schempp for the most thorough explanation. Voluntary prayer is allowed as long as it is not disruptive. School-led religious functions are not allowed as they are unconstitutional.<br>  <br>  This was the decision of a conservative Supreme Court in 1963.|`|lQGwzBoJaa	If they allow prayer in public schools then my kids won't go to public school.

In fact, teacher-led prayer of any kind is against the First Amendment. If kids want to pray quietly without disrupting class, that's fine and it happens all the time.

Even in private schools, while it is reasonable to expect teacher-led prayer, not all students should be forced to participate if they prefer not to. The reason? Not all kids in private schools are there by choice.|`|AA11430900	Mandatory prayer is illegal as it violates the separation of church and state and  violates the religious freedoms of those people who are not in the religion that is chosen to say a prayer in.<br>  <br>  That is why schools have a moment of silence - so they can say a silent prayer (or not as the case may be) to whatever deity they so choose.|`|67EaIAvbaa	yes..our kids need it..if they don't have it,well...you see the results from the unbelievers in here..the anger,frustration,jealousy,childish manners..the list goes on and on..just like the way satan wants it.|`|kFpFU97zaa	Preferably neither (if it takes away from class time).

As a taxpayer, I demand that we keep prayer (voluntary or mandatory) outside of school.  <br>  <br>  Religious instructions for those who are religious should happen at their home and churches.|`|BLWxEdrMaa	Voluntary prayer, with no pressure or suggestions from teachers, is fine and always has been constitutionally allowed anywhere in the USA, but as soon as we begin to teach one type of prayer or religion in public schools, we then violate the rights of all students present, disrespect their families and any traditions or religious values they may wish to teach their children at home, and of course also impede the rights of athiests to raise their children the way they wish to.  As soon as prayer is lead in school or taught in school or (God forbid) REQUIRED in school, we have ceased to honor the freedom we hold to truly belong to all citizens of this United States of America.  It's true that many freedoms end up illusion, but do they all have to?|`|Bqoydq1Oaa	Voluntary prayer.<br>  Prayer should never be discouraged, that is against freedom of religion. Our culture is becoming more and more secular. We shouldn't force our beliefs, but we should feel comfortable practicing them. Religion shouldn't be something completely private, because it has to do with interacting with others. People should be able to pray when they want, and share their faith with others. It creates better community, in my opinion.<br>  On the other hand no one should have to pray. My friend is Jewish, and went to Catholic school for eight years. She didn't mind the praying, she just did not participate, but found our beliefs interesting.|`|eLbrMleWaa	Mandatory?<br>  Absolutely not, I am atheist and I wouldn't want to be forced into praying. I would probably sit there daydreaming about something else and it takes away from school time that is already limited, I only get 20 minutes for lunch and I do not want a longer school day just so we can "pray".<br>  <br>  Voluntary?<br>  Thats up to the person, as long as it doesn't affect my learning then I could care less if they pray or not.<br>  <br>  But isn't prayer at home enough? Why take up your learning time to do something you can do when at home?<br>  <br>  And what ever happened to separation of church and state?|`|g7wuTmA0aa	Voluntary prayer would be best. By praying when you wish, it will appeal to the freedom we all have to choose who we pray to, if we pray or not. <br>  <br>  The other way, even if you pray or not, would not be liked at all. Why? Because nobody likes being forced to do something, even if they like it.|`|kX0T1urdaa	Voluntary prayer, certainly. When I went to school we used to pledge to the American flag and the Christian flag. Sometimes we heard a prayer over the intercom or prayed the Lord's prayer.<br>  <br>  This was over 50 years ago and look where our country is now without prayer in school.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.armageddonangelsufos.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.armageddonangelsufos.com</a>|`|5shqstYraa	Voluntary, as mandatory may be of the wrong wording, or worse|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	Voluntary silent prayer cannot be forbidden.  There is no way!<br>  <br>  1st Amendment guarantees us the right to worship as we please.|`|TYstsM7Yaa	Uh mandatory prayer permitted? that makes no sense, but no one should be forced to pray. And voluntary prayer is allowed in schools just not lead by a teacher.|`|dj6FHy15aa	Prayer is good....<br>  I don't believe in forcing prayer because the bible says "Come What may"<br>  But I believe even a voluntary prayer would do some good|`|91XGHfSaaa	I would have no problem with voluntary prayer so long as the student did not miss class time.|`|naI5hGjHaa	i thought church and state were seperate.  i think the school system falls under state.
2652ba9a7c4b6c7d461554ae484d484eaa	...........<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  First of all let me clear that EID in it self is a word denoting a day of festivity hence Muslims use it for every festival which relates to a happy occasion.<br>  <br>  Now main festivals of Muslims besides other are .......<br>  <br>  <br>  1. EID-AL-FITR i.e. a day of celebration just after the month of RAMDAN/RAMZAN.<br>  <br>  <br>  2-EID-AL-ZUHA/AZHA i.e. a day of celebration to commemorate the sacrifice of prophet Ibrahim/ Abraham.<br>  <br>  <br>  3-EID-e-MILAD Un NABI i.e. a day of rejoice when Prophet Mohammad was born. In India it is also known as 'BARAWAFAT' since Prophet Mohammad left this world on the same day.<br>  <br>  <br>  Today Muslims are celebrating the last one i.e. 'Eid e milad un Nabi' and in fact this festival is the BIGGEST of all since we got Mohammad who changed the world for good forever.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "FOUR YEARS AFTER THE DEATH OF JUSTINIAN, A.D. 569, WAS BORN AT MAKKAH, IN ARABIA THE MAN WHO, OF ALL MEN EXERCISED THE GREATEST INFLUENCE UPON THE HUMAN RACE ...

IF he WAS your boyfriend and Amanda asked him out, then she would NOT be a friend but only an acquaintance.  I think she should have asked you.  You don't own him but it would have been the courteous thing to do.  Since she has a thing for him, she must not know know he is gay.   She will feel like a fool when she finds out and it will serve her right.   I think you should find a real friend and drop Amanda.   What if you were in love with this boy?  Would she care?  Would she still have asked him out?  Don't hang out with people you cannot trust.|`|4GXXzbM7aa	I'm surprised she didn't ask you to go with her, seeing as you're the one she's friends with, and not him... Seems strange to me. <br>  <br>  Without really knowing any of you, it's hard to know what to say.  I think she should have spoken with you about it first though.|`|2E74C4gpaa	You need to dump the friend and move on with the boyfriend.

Some don't.  Maybe Amanda doesn't know he's gay?  Or is he actually bi and you're the one on the outside looking in?<br>  <br>  I suggest you take the b.s. by the horns and sit the two of them down together to talk with you.  Find out who knows what and why who asked who behind your back.  Lay your cards on the table, and find out where you all stand.  If you're in love with him, then he has a right to know his actions could hurt you.  And she may have no clue she's stepped on anyone's toes... she may just think two guys would never go to prom together.  Or maybe she has intentions of "converting" him so she can snatch him away from you.  Or maybe she WANTS a "safe" gay date so she won't be pressured into any sexual sitation afterward.<br>  <br>  You have to watch out for the tigers.  Betrayal and heartbreak are never fun for anyone no matter what your sexual orientation.  But in this situation, it's no good playing guessing games.  Be honest and demand honesty back in return!  Who knows... when all is said and done, maybe the three of you will end up going to prom together like 3 peas in a pod.  Good luck!|`|b3783773e6afd95ad1913ece4e9fff9daa	Aren't YOU taking him to prom?  Though maybe your school doesn't allow same sex couples to attend prom as dates.  In any case, yes, it's rude that your friend asked your boyfriend without your permission.  I'd ask her about it.|`|ACcqroPLaa	This is kinda tricky.... I mean, she probably assumed that since he is gay, then it wouldn't matter, and that it would be more of a friendly date than an actual date. I do think she should have talked to you about it but it is too late for that now. I think before anything just let her know how you feel. Talk it out with her and let her know she should have come to you first and that you feel her actions were inappropriate. If she is mature, then she should be able to see where you are coming from and you should be able to work things out so that both of you feel comfortable.

There is nothing wrong with it, but it could point to an area where you have to deal with some matters.|`|pDd5jRxEaa	Depends .........it it upsets you then it is bad, if not then not.|`|11bIXqaqaa	Many people have the same dream over and over again. It is not a negative thing. Negative is the way you decide to view a situation. And just because something seems negative at first does not mean that it is going to be that way forever. For instance if I did something bad as a kid and got a tap on the bum it sure seemed negative but in reality I learned not to run onto the street in traffic and get myself killed.. obviously beneficial! Maybe post the dream and we can dissect it for you. Sorry for the run on sentence.|`|8yYLH1XAaa	i say it depends on if the dream is good or bad. i've had recurring dreams in the past.

Sure enough, in the 8th grade, i became class President!<br>  <br>  A bad recurring dream i had, however, was picturing myself in the hospital. i had this dream countless times; again, before entering 8th grade. While in 8th grade, i had numerous, close family members pass away...it was horrible.<br>  <br>  So i think it depends on the dreams. If they're good, expect something good to happen...whether it relates to the individuals themselves or something that will happen to them and/or you, keep an observation on what happens. If they're bad, expect something bad to happen. Due to my dreams and outcomes of them, i truly believe that dreams can be premonitions of things to come, whether it be in the near future or far future. Sometimes they say if you think about something or someone oftentimes before sleeping, you end up having a dream about them. So simply that can play into things and could mean nothing. i think dreams and the meanings behind them are just fascinating.|`|MhjvV0b7aa	Depends is the dream good or bad? Also, you might just be hung up on something and your subconscious is trying to help you figure out your problem. Like sleeping on it|`|o9bmmhN8aa	I agree with the person above me but for it to be good or bad to have a reoccurring dream it would be is your dream that you are dreaming good or bad
RvddYKqjaa	Each person gets their own note of thanks.|`|J1kJb98Maa	yes each one gets their own thank you card and i would suggest saying some thing more personal than " thank you for contributing to the gift"<br>  maybe say different things you will use the card for..example<br>  thank you for the gift card i am planning on using it towards a stroller.<br>  or <br>  thank you for for the shower it was so thoughtful of you all to have gotten a gift card from Macys they have so many great baby items there.  once again thank you!<br>  edited to add<br>   the poster below  seems to be lacking common sense and manners|`|AA11780840	One card or 12 cards... could do it...However, none them took the time to go out and buy gifts just one little gift card where NOW you have to go out and buy whatever it is you need or want... However, if you want to send individual cards to say thank you WAIT until you buy each and every gift and attach one of those gifts to 1 of the 12 coworkers.... OR since this is an OFFICE Make a HUGE Thank You Card and hang it on a bulletin board thanking them each individually with all of there names on the card.... Since this is a coworker baby shower and not your regular baby shower you can be more creative in your Thank Yous.... Maybe you can make or purchase cake ..... that would feed up to 15 people and That says "THANK YOU". This of course would be in Lieu of thank you cards...<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	I think in this situation, you could get by (and it would be cute) to post one card and word it like 'Thank you for the baby shower and I appreciate all the contributions made to my gift card. It was thoughtful and I got some great stuff!'|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	Yes you need to make separate thank you cards for each person. I always say thank you for the gift card it will help me towards.. whatever you plan on using it for.|`|VlzlPAEwaa	Just bring in enough cup cakes to feed the group, with one big thank you card...should be enough|`|GEIuZ2ivaa	Yes, each person gets their own thank you. Just say "thank you for the very generous gift, it was much appreciated and will definitely be put to good use"|`|ND1nFEWSaa	use individual cards and do not say contributing to the gift card say thank you for the gift card

Is this a joke?|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	Just take your time exploring each others bodies and finding out what feels good. There's no one set of instructions that is going to be the right thing for everyone. Communicate and tell each other what you are enjoying. Don't expect too much the first time, its going to take a while to figure out what works best for the two of you. Once you're more comfortable with each other you might want to reconsider the "no oral" thing. It can be a little freaky going down on a girl for the first time but its well worth it.|`|hyYWX82Eaa	Start by getting naked and cuddling/touching. It's impossible to give a step by step because every woman and her body are different. You'll have to figure it out, but as long as you know where the clit is and what it does you're set<br>  <br>  <br>  And don't knock oral until you've tried it. Just saying. ***** is ggggrrreat|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	If you two arnt interested in strap-on(which is ok because alot of lesbians arn't).Or oral sex what exactly do you plan on doing.

34SAe5k6aa	well, they're still part of the "anglosphere" (which is the U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and a few other countries), so culturally, they're very similar.

JhEboCmDaa	It's not even a class struggle, just a culture and ideals struggle, which religion ties into. We're rich, fat and lazy (figuratively of course) and too liberal to fit their culture, but not liberal enough to be overly tolerant and kind towards them. <br>  <br>  They dislike us because of the fact that our overall quality of life is better, and we value things that are very different from their values. Most simply learn this through Islam, and it isn't really the cause itself.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Nonsense; every single one of the 9/11 hijackers, the leaders of Hamas, etc., have at least bachelors degrees and came from at least middle class homes. It is not education, it isn't politics - or more Palestinian Christians would be blowing themselves up - and it isn't economics. The only explanatory element is the fact that the Qur'an says kill the unbelievers, and the Imams are willing to emphasize such barbarism. I'm not saying other factors aren't involved, but the only common one is faith.|`|DArAz67Caa	NO----the muslim faith is very dangerous----corrupt----and against our creator-----it's very anti-woman---in addition-|`|oPQAPfYXaa	That would be great if that was the case, but it's not.  What you have is a Ninth Century mentality meshed with extremism.  It doesn't matter if the extremists come out of poverty, or influence; as long as the imams that preach extremism can recruit with impunity, and escape the consequences of their evil, the innocent will continue to die, and the cycle will repeat itself.<br>  Really, what needs to happen is that the same Muslim imams that send their followers to their deaths need to be held accountable - by their own faith.  If these bastards were strung up by their neck until they were dead, and left for the birds to pick over, and this was broadcast on Al Jazeera - things would change rather quickly.

AA11185865	Many of the gods of the Egyptians were composed of animals which the Israelites would use in sacrifice in their worship. That would be like burning the nation's flag within its own borders in the sight of the nation's own citizens. <br>  <br>  While the Israelites would be sacrificing the animals in worship of their God and not on purpose to demonstrate against nor insult Egpyt, the country they were living in, nor the Egyptians, whom they worked among, the Egyptians would not see the difference and would be greatly insulted and disgusted from the individual level all the way up to the national level, at the very least.|`|wBfV82fAaa	obviously god wants no one to suffer, the egyptians got the plagues as punishment, they did not deserve to suffer the embarrassment of their ''god'' being slaughtered.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	My thoughts is that you are guilty of a suppressed premise fallacy.

Because of Jesus Christ suffering for all sins of the world in the Garden of Gethesame and then ressurection after His Crucifiction, Christ overcame SIN and DEATH.

This is because before we came to earth, we were just spirits and could not experience all the senses that a human body can. And yet Christ gives all Glory to Heavenly Father.

YnGIccE8aa	They are NOT in the Bible -- it's called Sacred Tradition and the churches who have it are the Roman, Greek and Eastern Orthodox churches.Congratulations for discovering Sola Scriptura is not "gospel."<br>  <br>  You rock. I am not being facetious.|`|cetqJFuBaa	Jesus addressed this issue directly.  The Pharisees asked why Jesus' disciples didn't wash their hands per tradition.<br>  <br>  Read Matthew 15 for context:<br>  Jesus replied, "Every plant not planted by my heavenly Father will be rooted up, so ignore [the Pharisees]. They are blind guides leading the blind, and if one blind person guides another, they will both fall into a ditch."<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  There are traditions that come from all directions, and you can infer them from the bible.  More can be found, though, outside the bible.  Read the Mishnah for what Jesus was likely talking about.  They are like the judges in America that talk about what the legislators meant when they wrote down the congressional laws.  It's not to say that they didn't have a few good insights, but sometimes they were clearly wrong.

AA11468524	Yes it could be a microchip implanted under the skin, but we should take the normal meaning of the phrase.  It says "mark" which means a visible mark, and that the number 666 is specifically identified with the name of the Beast.  The Mark will probably include the name of "The Beast." (This is speculation though)<br>  <br>  The significance of the warning is that a concious choice must be made to accept this mark.  It requires identity with the Antichrist and probably worship of the Beast will be an integral part of the ceremony.  The technology is unclear, but whatever method is used, the Bible is quite clear in its warning.....<br>  If you take the mark you will be lost forever.   To refuse the Mark will mean you will die.  Either by execution or by starvation (cannot buy or sell).  <br>  <br>  It is Antichrists diabolical way of separating believers from those who will follow him.  The Tribulation saints will be sealed with a mark from God and will not take the Mark of the Beast.<br>  Many will be martyred as explained in Revelation.<br>  <br>  I've read the last page of the book....never fear Jesus wins.<br>  <br>  Mat 16:25  For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.<br>  <br>  Mat 10:28  And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.|`|AA12070800	The mark of the beast is not a literal mark.  Revelation was written to a church being persecuted by the Roman Empire.  The numbers 666 are symbolic and represent imperfection, the number 7 representing perfection, infinity etc...Revelation was not meant to be a literal prophecy, as in telling the future, it was written in symbol and allegory so that Christians of the time could read it and take hope that God would ultimately prevail over the forces of evil.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	"666" is NOT the "Mark of the Beast".

I think the anti-christ is going to end up with a bunch of near robots (which would explain why once you take the mark you can't repent...  your mind will be altered and you won't be able to think independently anymore).<br>  <br>  EDIT: Here's an excerpt from a vision someone had about this:<br>  <br>  I looked closer and saw people like dead men walking.  There was a desperate sadness in the air, and no one turned to the right or left.  I saw that the people were being led about by some unseen force.  Now and then a voice spoke to them out of the air, and they obeyed the voice.  They did not talk to one another.  I saw too that the number "666" was written on each one's forehead and on his hands.  I saw soldiers on horses herding the people about as though they were cattle.<br>  <br>  The American flag, tattered and torn, lay forlornly on the ground.  There was no joy, no laughter, no happiness.  I saw death and evil everywhere.<br>  <br>  The people walked one behind another into a large department store.  They kept in step like discouraged soldiers and were dressed identically in a type of prison garb.  A fence surrounded the store, and guards were stationed here and there.  Everywhere I looked, I saw soldiers in battle-dress uniforms.  <br>  <br>  I saw these zombie-like people herded into the store, where they were able to buy only the barest necessities.  As each completed his purchases, he was placed aboard a large green army truck.  The truck, well-guarded, was then driven to another area.<br>  <br>  Here, in a type of clinic, these people were examined for communicable diseases or crippling handicaps.  A small number of them were shuffled to the side as rejects.<br>  <br>  Soon, those who failed the examination were taken to another room.  In that room, an impressive array of switches, buttons and gages lined an entire wall.  A door opened, and several technicians came in.  One of them began to call the names of the people in the room.  Without a struggle, they arose when their names were called and marched into a large box.  When they were inside, another technician closed the door and pulled a switch in a panel on the wall.<br>  <br>  A few minutes later he opened the door, took down a broom and dust pan, and swept what remained of them off the floor.  Nothing but a bit of dust was left of what had once been a roomful of people!<br>  <br>  I saw those people who passed the medical exam being put back into the same truck and driven, to a train.  No one spoke or even turned to look at anyone else.  At another building each person was assigned a job.  They all went to work without a single dispute.  I watched as they worked very hard at their assigned tasks, and then at the end of the day, they were taken to an apartment building with a high fence around it.  Each undressed and went to bed.  Tomorrow they would work hard again.<br>  <br>  I heard a loud voice fill the night air.  " I saw a huge beast, and he sat on a large, I throne.  All the people obeyed the beast.  I saw spiritual horns growing from his head.  They reached, into and out of every place on earth.  The beast took upon himself many positions of authority and many offices, and he became great in power.<br>  <br>  The beast pushed himself into many places and deceived many people.  The rich and the famous were deceived as well as the poor and disfranchised.  Small and great paid homage to the beast.  <br>  <br>  A large machine was brought into an office.  The beast put his mark on it, and his voice came out of it.  There was also a "big brother" machine that could see into homes and businesses.  Only a single machine of this type existed, and it belonged to the beast.  The part of the machine that was located in the homes of the people was invisible to the naked eye, but it could and did report to the beast every move the people made.  I watched as the beast turned his throne around and faced toward me.  On his forehead was the number 666.<br>  <br>  As I watched, I saw another man in another office become very angry at the beast.  He demanded to talk with him.  He was yelling at the top of his voice.  The beast appeared and seemed very courteous as he said, "Come, I can help you take care of all your problems."<br>  <br>  The beast took the angry man into a large room and motioned for him to lie down on a table.  The room and the table reminded me of a hospital emergency room.  The man was given an anesthesia and wheeled beneath a vast machine.  The beast attached wires to the man's head and turned on the machine.  On the top of the machine were the words, "This mind eraser belongs to the beast, 666."<br>  <br>  When the man was removed from the table, his eyes had a vacant stare, and his movements reminded one of a zombie in a movie.  I saw a large blank spot on the top of his head, and I knew his mind had been surgically altered so he could be controlled by the beast.<br>  <br>  The beast said, "Now, sir, don't you feel better? Didn't I say I could take care of all your problems? I have given you a new mind.  You will have no worries or troubles now."<br>  <br>  The man did not speak.<br>  <br>  "You will obey my every command," said the beast as he picked up a small object and attached it to the man's shirt.  He spoke again to the man, and he answered without moving his lips.  He moved like a living dead man.  "You will work and not get angry or frustrated, nor will you cry or be sad.  You will work for me until you die.  I have many like you that I control.  Some lie, some kill, some steal, some make war, some have children, some run machinery, and some do other things.  Yes, I control everything." An evil laugh came from him.<br>  <br>  The man was handed papers to sign.  He gladly gave all his belongings to the beast.<br>  <br>  In my vision I saw the man leave the office of the beast, get in a car and drive home.  When he approached his wife, she tried to kiss him, but he made no attempt to respond.  He had no feeling for his wife or anyone else.  The beast had made him incapable of feeling any emotion.<br>  <br>  The wife became very angry and screamed at her husband, but to no avail.  At last she said, "OK, I'll call the beast.  He will know what to do." After a quick phone call, she left the house and drove to the same building her husband had just left.<br>  <br>  The beast welcomed her in and said, "Tell me all your troubles.  I am sure I can help you."<br>  <br>  A very handsome man took her by the arm and led her to the same table her husband had been on earlier.  After the same operation, she also became a depersonalized slave of the beast.<br>  <br>  I heard the beast ask her, "How do you feel?" She did not answer until after he had attached a small object to her blouse.  Then she acknowledged that he was master and lord and began to worship him.<br>  <br>  "You will be a breeder," he said.  "You will have perfect babies, and they will worship and serve me."<br>  <br>  The woman replied in a robotic voice, "Yes, master, I will obey."<br>  <br>  I saw the woman again.  This time she was in another building.  There were many pregnant women there.  The women lay lifelessly on their beds and in chanted monotones praised the beast.  All had 666 on their foreheads.<br>  <br>  When their babies were born, they were taken to another building where mind-altered nurses had the task of raising them.  The nurses also had 666 on their foreheads.<br>  <br>  The beast grew in power until his empire stretched across the earth.  The babies also grew, and at a certain time, they also went beneath the mind-destroying machine.  They worshiped the beast and his image.  But the machine had no power over the children of God.<br>  <br>  I heard the voice of the Lord say, "Those that worship the beast and his image shall perish.  Many shall be deceived and will fall, but I will save my children from the beast.  These things will take place in the end times.  Do not take the mark of the beast.  Repent now before it is too late.<br>  <br>  "The beast will call himself a man of peace.  And he will bring peace to many nations out of a very chaotic time.  He will be able to supply the world with many inexpensive goods, and he will assure that everyone's pay is sufficient.  He will make an alliance with many nations, and the great men of the world will follow him into a false sense of security.|`|4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	The bottom line is that it's a vague passage, so people have inevitably had all sorts of crazy interpretations about it over the years.  A lot of scholars these days think the 666 is the geometric alphabet number for "Nero", and the book is mostly a political rant that overdoes the metaphors.|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	The bible says that the mark of the beast is a number ( 666) and it says that it is the number of a man,nero's name numerically is 666,interestingly enough  NERO  of rome was the creator of the first currency(the coin)so maybe MONEY  itself is the mark of the beast.|`|d0526f2bf35299e2ac74512f8dff025faa	666 referred to Nero.

If you don't worship him and accept him as savior, then he won't take care of you.  He will have control over everything because he comes in peace and deceives many into thinking he is Christ the Messiah.  That is why you can't buy or sell, because to do so you must accept anti-Christ as savior.  He is a wolf in sheep's clothing.   Forget all the images you see of fire and brim stone from the anti-Christ.  For him to be deceptive he has to appear to be Christ-like.<br>  <br>  Revelations 13:11-18<br>  <br>   "11Then I saw another beast, coming out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon. 12He exercised all the authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. 13And he performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men. 14Because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the inhabitants of the earth. He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. 15He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. 16He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, 17so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.<br>  <br>   18This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number. His number is 666."|`|mAa25My0aa	The mark of the beast is a dramatic way of saying being differentiated as a follower of the Antichrist.  I'm not sure that much more is said of it other then that it is worn by followers of the Antichrist and they're doomed, etc etc. Personally I believe this to be a Nike brand.  Just do it!  Do what, grovel at the feet of the beast from the sea?  Maybe so.<br>  <br>  Some have interpreted the mark to be 666 because John obscured the name of the Antichrist though gematria.  To my knowledge the name itself has was not revealed, only it's numeric representation.  It should be noted that many names can be represented as 666 through this system but John used it to refer to a specific person whose name will add up to this value, whom that person is, is unknown.<br>  <br>  In any case the mark is supposed to be worn on either the right hand or forehead, so I guess my Nike theory is out, but maybe those Lance Armstrong wrist brands are close enough to the hand to be suspect but alas his name = 29 or something.<br>  <br>  It's further said that no man may buy, sell, etc unless he wears this mark, or the name or number of the beast.  I would interpret this to be "or" as in one or the other, not that each is equivalent.  So the mark maybe a logo or image of some sort, or if the fashionable prefer, the number 666 or if they are truly chic and in the know then the actual name of the Antichrist which as I have established is not Lance Armstrong.  But 666 is not the mark, it's just one possible mark out of three you may wear.|`|sjOx1Hokaa	Things have been leading up to an end time scenario. Included in this is a deception. The whole world is convinced that a certain individual or antichrist is the true christ when it is really not. The scriptures give clues about who this character is, to include a number that has to do with who it is. What is interesting is what is revealed using the two numbers 616 and 666. 666 is vstr in Hebrew which is vav, samech, tav, resh. Vav is a prefix and str means secret or hidden. Others have discovered similar information. Below is one example:<br>  <br>  by queenannie38<br>  tav (400) resh (200) samech (60) vav (6) <br>  <br>  ???? <br>  <br>  (truth/perfection)-(the wicked)-(divine presence/holy of holies)-(man/redemption) <br>  <br>  Check out the traditional meanings of those letters: <br>  <br>  tav = sign/mark (literal) covenant/to seal (symbolic) <br>  resh = head (literal) person/head/highest (symbolic) <br>  samech = a prop (literal) support/turn (symbolic) <br>  vav = nail (literal) secure/hook/add (symbolic) <br>  <br>  Very ODD how 'head' or 'highest' (as in ruler) is also 'the wicked.' <br>  <br>  I know both of these representational systems work consistently work throughout all the Hebrew scriptures - but I prefer the more esoteric symbologies, myself - because they have taken me a level deeper into my understandings. <br>  <br>  Does this shed any light on '666?' <br>  <br>  Whoever wrote this has absolutely no affiliation with our family nor any acquaintance. We used a source that is not connected with us to help establish the information we believe. Nail, Prop, Cross, and Head are the elements of the crucifix and are revealed as the image of the beast. Interestingly jesus adds up to 616, j=yod=10, e=niqqud, s=shin=300, u=vav=6, s=shin=300. The scriptures state that many would come in his name this is to include the antichrist. The Messiah states in Revelation he will give his new name to those who overcome and the Messiah also states he has a name that no one knows but he himself. The true Christ will reveal his name to those that are his at his coming and at the same time the antichrist will be completely destroyed. The antichrist until then will deceive the world and at some point anyone who doesn't worship him will be forced to either bow down or be killed. The history of Christianity itself is well documented to have done similar things in the past, like forcing people to be baptised. Another unaffiliated source, just did a quick search for forced baptism and this is one example that came up <a href="http://therefinersfire.org/christian_apo..." rel="nofollow">http://therefinersfire.org/christian_apo...</a> . Especially noted is during the times of the reformation. Heavy persecution is one of the main reasons why the so called "pilgrims" came to the "new world". According to the scriptures an image of the beast will be placed in the temple of God. Many believe this will be in Jerusalem, which means there will be a crucifix placed at the site of the Dome of the Rock.<br>  As for the mark being placed on the forehead and hand<br>  <br>  Revelation 14:9...If anyone worships the beast and his image, <br>  <br>       Exodus 20:4 “You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any <br>  image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: <br>  <br>  Revelation 14:9 cont. and receives a mark on his forehead, or on his hand, <br>  <br>       Exodus 20:5 you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them... <br>  <br>  Bowing down and serving is the mark on the forehead and hand.|`|EBqFpZbjaa	The numbr 666 is an early Christian code number for the Emperior Caligula who was called "The Beast" because of his bestial behaviour towards Christians.  He also had an incestuous relationship with his own sister whom he murdered.<br>  <br>  It is a mistake to assign 666 to such as Nero, even though he is believed to have burned Christians to death in the arena at Rome.  This is just a lie.  Nero seldom ever went to the arena, he was preoccupied with music and poety and the chariot racing and did not care much for "blood in the sand".<br>  <br>  Stabbed 666 times and eaten by Satanists.<br>  <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1692637.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/new...</a><br>  <br>  People should take warning and not mess with evil.|`|UWKF7x4faa	666 was the numeric sign of the name of the emperor Nero.

Strangely enough, this was the first definition that popped up when I looked up the definition of tolerance:  "the power or capacity of an organism to tolerate unfavorable environmental conditions".

Ask him about something about homework. DO NOT ask him about someone- you don't want to start rumors or trouble. Ask them if they've tried Y/A? Tell them you are mkay. Ask if they have a name or suggest one. <br>  <br>  If you want to come out to him...Are you friendly enough with him you ask ,"What are you doing this weekend?" or tell him you wanted to see a certain movie, do you want to see it? Your first encounter is to see how he is outside of school. This way he does not have to be on his guard around other schoolmates. You just might make a new friend that way.<br>  <br>  See how that goes. Your still in school, probably that time or the second time getting together you'll talk and laugh about jerkin off. I did it, you will or already have to. Get a feel for his thoughts on sex. Believe me the conversation will get there- you're a teenager.

The fossil record is the best scripture for this and it wasn't written by man.  Geology proves we've been here 4.5 billion years.

U8Fwh38jaa	Long before the coming of Christ, Pagans used the cross as a religious symbol.  The classic "t" cross (tau cross) used by Christians  was first used by an older religious society -- Druids, among others.   The Druids' cross represented the Thau or god.   Many believe that that meaning is why Christianity integrated the tau cross as a Christian symbol.   <br>  <br>  But many other societies used the cross as a religious symbol as well.  In some religions it represented the relationship between man, nature and the gods.  In others, it represented the sun god and the life giving rays that emanate from the sun.  There are many meanings to the cross that are older than Christianity.  <br>  <br>  Here is an article that goes into depth about the origins and symbolism of the cross in Christianity as well as other religions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/218795/the_origin_of_the_cross_symbol_used.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	It meant you would do what Rome said you would do, or else.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	The same thing the electric chair means today.|`|Z5TuccoIaa	it was considered a curse to be crucified on the cross a sign of punishment for sin or breaking the law.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Gal 3:13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:|`|tQW18Kspaa	Which Cross?<br>  There are many.<br>  <a href="http://www.crossroad.to/Books/symbols1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crossroad.to/Books/symbols1.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross#History" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross#Histo...</a>|`|k3LbhASGaa	I think it always meant that you were gonna die|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	Baal worship,roots of tammuz.THE 'T' stood for his name.|`|N58YMuuxaa	wow... the crucifixion is no difference to me then wearing a knife around yer neck.

2Hot9EJiaa	I will share a story that explains it very well<br>  <br>  A tightrope walker said- "I can walk across this tightrope blindfolded, do you believe me"-  the audience, yelled and screamed "Yes we believe"<br>  Then he said "who would be willing to sit on my shoulders as we go across the rope?"  No one answered that one.  The first statement- each person believed that he could do this feat.  They did not have faith though- because they did not trust the tightrope walker to carry them across safely.  You can believe without commitment, you cannot have faith with commitment.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Faith -- is the substance of things hope for, the things un-seen :)<br>  <br>  Believing -- is already knowing before hand a hope :) In other words, it seems one must first believe, and then have faith—i.e., trust in that which is provable, reliable, and based on experience|`|69SHxWA9aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  At first I was thinking that both words are nearly interchangeable, but reading some of the other answers brings up some good points.<br>  <br>  Believing can be something like I believe this car is blue, because I see it is this color.<br>  <br>  Having faith is something that you need to trust another to know what is being described.  So your uncle's car, that you have never seen - you can ask him the color, and have faith that he told you the truth.  So you have faith that your uncle's car is blue - if that is the color that he said it is.<br>  <br>  Having Faith that God will be there to take care of our soul once we pass from living on earth is something that takes faith.  There are reasons to have faith in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of the Pannin Bible?<br>  <br>  Mr. Pannin knew both old Greek, and several other languages, and knew that each hebrew letter contains a number.  So to describe something in hebrew they use letters to describe a word, or letters in a certain order to describe a number value.<br>  <br>  So the first 12 letters = 1 to 12, while the next letters are something like 20, 40, 100, 200 and so on.<br>  <br>  Pannin then tried to disprove the Bible by taking a number value, and then showing how everything did not make sense.  Afterall, he was from Russia, where all where atheists.<br>  <br>  However Mr. Pannin found that each sentence was a mathmatical model.  Each word fits into each paragraph.  It would be impossible to write another paragraph and still meet the mathmatical possibilities found in the real Bible.<br>  <br>  Someone asked one time if there are mispellings in the Bible.  We are reading versions of the Bible that where printed in the past 50 years. There are many versions of the Bible, and each version used another set of words to translate the Bible from old english into the type of words we understand today.  Some translated well, other versions are not worth keeping, as they are poor translations, produced by people who did not fully understand the Bible or it's meaning.<br>  <br>  The problem is that each greek or hebrew word can be translated into two or up to ten meanings.  Just like the people of Alaska have 37 words to describe snow, each greek and hebrew word can have 2 or more meanings.<br>  <br>  So nowdays one must have faith that the version of the Bible that they study is an accurate translation.<br>  <br>  They also must have faith that the people they study the Bible with are going to not lead them astray.  So many churches are off course.  There are many key points that you can look at, to see if the church is following what is written in the Bible. <br>  <br>  Just a short look at Deuteronomy 4:15 to 4:20 shows what many "New" churches are accepting are not in compliance with what is written in te Bible.  In 4:16 is says do not sin by making idols of any kind, don't make statures of men or women, of animals on earth, or birds that fly.  <br>  <br>  It goes on to say don't bow down to worship the things you see in the sky, because the Lord your God has made these things for all people everywhere. <br>  <br>  So have you been in a church with idols all around you?  Perhaps a cross?  And followed the traditions of man in worshiping things other than God?<br>  <br>  I hope that you will meet a person with the Holy Spirit within them someday, and know that you have met a person who has faith.  The test is in the fruits that they can bear.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Belief is the acknowledgment of an idea. Faith is putting that belief into action. Faith requires action, based upon belief, sustained by confidence. <br>  <br>  Example:<br>  You might believe that the Saints will beat the Bears in football. But you place your faith in the Saints if you actually bet on them.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	One can believe something based on evidence. Faith is what people have when they want to believe something without  - even in spite of - evidence.|`|dtrYjyYZaa	the terms are interchangeable|`|PvgZUzHjaa	Belief is normally caused by evidence and rational analysis.  When it is without such evidence, or in the face of evidence to the contrary, it is called faith.<br>  <br>  I used to think faith was always a stupid thing.  But I said something to that effect to Kate Lovelady, leader of the Ethical Society of St. Louis.  She responded that she has faith in the inherent value of every human being, in spite of evidence to the contrary.<br>  <br>  She had a point.  Sometimes faith is a rational decision.|`|tRXKLDvraa	Faith - belief in something that has no substance that can be measured...<br>  I am not talking about the amount of faith one has but merely the belief in the existence of something that cannot be seen or heard and no substantial way to prove it exists.<br>  <br>  Belief - can be values that you hold or consider to be true. This has more of a substantive value because you can believe in things that are measurable and observable and it can be based on opinion whether or not that it actually is true (i.e., you believe your house will sell today, you believe that the shade of yellow is more of a beige, etc.)  You can believe in those things.  <br>  <br>  connectivity between the two - your faith can lead you to belief - i.e., belief in a higher power or existence beyond human kind, like a creator.|`|PwD3slrTaa	Easy, actually.<br>  <br>  Belief is intellectual assent of a given statement.<br>  <br>  Faith is ACTING on that.  To have faith, for instance, is to do what you would do if you believed the thing.<br>  <br>  Most people put the cart before the horse, though, and try to exercise faith in a Biblical way without having it.  You gotta get it first; by asking God to dwell with you and speak with Him, prayer, and study.  Worship works too, especially in the Old Testament.<br>  <br>  Oh and you could look up A. A.

To say you believe in something could mean anything. To believe in someithing just means you belive it exists or can occur. To have faith in something means you take that object you believe in and put it to more importance. To have faith in something means a lot more than just believeing in it. <br>  For instance you could believe in god but actually whats important is putting faith and following god.|`|e599f8e9840310f064e7afa7423bfa60aa	There isn't much difference.  Faith is something that you truly cannot see.  To believe in something or someone allows that the person or thing may been seen, but you buy into them completely.  You have faith in what they are telling you, or what they represent.  Believing is just a way of having faith in something that is a bit more tangible.|`|pmRQDncsaa	Faith goes beyond believing. If you have faith in something you believe it with or without evidence. You trust in it to no end. If you believe something you can think that it is there, but you can't trust it.<br>  <br>  For example: Satan believes in God. He knows he exists, but he doesn't have faith in him.|`|IAkudEUgaa	Faith is the trust you have in something in the absence of proof or fact.<br>  Belief is the trust you have in something only when you DO have proof or fact of its existence.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  I do not have FAITH in religion, because there is no fact or proof behind God's existence.<br>  I DO have BELIEF in evolution, because there are thousands of books and scientific evidence that points to its existence.<br>  <br>  <br>  i hope it might help<br>  goodluck|`|3l6DE1m0aa	I love teaching people about faith and belief, and in my opinion, most do not understand them even though they are very sincere and spiritual people.  However, I can't say much in the brevity of a Yahoo answer.  Faith is to take the hope we have in our hearts (in Jesus Christ) and create reality with it/ from it by our actions.  Belief is a system in our soul that actions come from.  If you believe a way, actions will come from that belief.  A belief can be faithful if we choose it to be.  Our beliefs must be changed, transformed, to allow us to love one another and be pure, instead of always fighting each other.  How we transform our beliefs is by faith.|`|mh17M1B1aa	To have faith is when you believe in the religion you are practicing.

There's no theology in the idea that people will magically vanish, that is distinctly science fiction.<br>  <br>  The rapture only speaks of a massive change in the way the Kingdom of God is seen. Some say that in the rapture God will descend from heaven to live on earth in the New Jerusalem. Others say people will be physically removed from the earth. It's all up to one's interpretation, however the Kingdom of God is not necessarily heaven by itself (a place divorced from earth).|`|dz5Og81Qaa	The Left Behind series is pure fiction.

1CxcmMdiaa	I can see where you're coming from.<br>  I tend to view it kind of like secular oldies and new music.<br>  Both hymns and praise and worship (most anyways) have great meanings and are needed.<br>  <br>  That being said, I absolutely love the Hymn "Tis so Sweet to Trust in Jesus", it does have a lot of meaning for me since I tend to struggle with my faith at times.<br>  However, there are several worship songs that I absolutely love as well.|`|85c6832eec366f539d7b941dc3b61894aa	I'm an atheist, but here's my opinion on Christian music.<br>  <br>  I love hymns. To me, they are like my childhood's soundtrack. I sing them when I'm doing housework, I hum them when I get nervous, etc. I have a special place in my heart for that music, even if they no longer touch me the same way they once did. Some of them are astonishingly beautiful. "When I Survey The Wondrous Cross" is one of my favorites; it's just a good song.<br>  <br>  Modern Christian music sucks. That's the only word for it. They just throw a bunch of slobbering lyrics on top of some chords. It's really terrible.|`|1IrVn1Dlaa	Well, modern christian music uses popular genres like pop, rock, rap etc, which I believe, takes away the pureness of the message. When you hear an Hymn, you feel the music, the message, the happiness/sadness of the song.|`|2zYCQX9saa	I love all types of music. I am not sure what you mean when you say a "hymn".

Most Christian music lyrics are not scripturally sound. <br>  <br>  Most people like to sing  so they can get all worked up emotionally and be all 'soulish' rather than being in the spirit to worship.|`|kv7QdQHCaa	Nothing wrong with either, in my opinion, although it's nice to see a 7 yr. old and his grandmother singing the same hymn in church (which is the hymn she learned when she was 7).|`|vb5oY7O6aa	:) its been added to the church so at least some ppl will turn up even if only to sing.|`|AA11503457	I grew up with both so I appreciate both.|`|45Mmu3SFaa	I love hymns as well, modern Christian music don't cut it for me....|`|AA12077420	I love hymns too,but during praise sessions,I prefer modern christian music|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	Sorry if this sounds like an admonition -- it kind of is...<br>  <br>  I think there is a place for diversity in worship music.  Hymns are fine, but so is contemporary music (which will often speak to an unchurched person more than hymns).<br>  <br>  You can't really say that modern Christian songs don't seem to touch the heart as much.  What you really mean to say is that they don't seem to touch *your* heart as much -- but for others, hymns leave them dry and a modern song touches their heart and moves them to tears.<br>  <br>  It's unfortunate, but there does seem to be a "Hymns vs. modern Christian music" in the church -- when we should be rejoicing in the diversity and using a wide range of music to reach a wider circle of people.  <br>  <br>  That's my soapbox -- and a subject I am passionate about, having served for over 20 years as a director of music and worship arts at various churches.<br>  <br>  Oh -- and let's not forget multicultural music, too!<br>  <br>  ______________<br>  Edit:  Also -- keep in mind that a rigid sense of ownership of any part of a church worship service leads to divisions, people feeling unwelcomed, and is one reason why outsiders want nothing to do with a church.  <br>  <br>  Do we want to draw people in or not -- that is the question, and has nothing to do with what *we* like better (and isn't the music supposed to be sent in God's direction, anyway?).|`|2Hot9EJiaa	I love both- why?  Because it is God we are worshiping, not the music, or should be. I am a musician, both an instrumentalist and a singer, and yes, there is some music that I like better than others. However, when I am worshiping God, I can worship with "HOW GREAT THOU ART" 0r the newer Christian song, called HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Hymns are the best. Modern Christian music is essentially commercial, canned, overproduced, designed to make big money for "Christian" music companies in Nashville and L.A. It's a blight on Christianity. I avoid any church that has a "contemporary worship band." That's the kind of thing that is killing Christianity.|`|AM7cK4L9aa	I refer you to Ephesians 5:18-20 (Key is 19) Psalms are God's songs, Hymns are the love of the past generation, and Spiritual songs are the songs of this generation. All are important and key to true Worship.|`|WjRqYf6naa	I love the traditional hymns and I don't care at all for the modern Christian music.It all sounds like James Taylor overdosed on Xanax. I grew up with hymns and Southern Gospel, and I'm too old to change.|`|RrJSf2FZaa	it weirds me out when we go to church with my sister in law and there is a soft rock band playing.  It just seems wrong.  I like old school church hymn music.

The Middle East will rule the whole world. It might be Israel or the Arabs. <br>  The micro-chipping humans will come before the millennium. <br>  Yes Christians are being readied by God for the Rapture.

Vice President Cheney and his puppet, George W. Bush, ignored Congress, so far with impunity, for eight years. Obama taught Congressional law at the University of Chicago.

Luckily for me in my country we can get married and we did.<br>  <br>  Btw not all hetero couples get married and the same applies to gay couples.|`|hFpchZ1saa	Well Im not gay but if i was old and unmarried id marry my best friend so shed get the benefits.

I think they want to try to prove a point|`|963d63f6d3d4458368e99dbfe9b34914aa	Here's the deal for me... most "sub-cultured gays", meaning the ones who band together and repeat word to word what they hear the other one say, is gonna say something along the lines of... "Because this is a DEMOCRACY, and EVERYONE is a free man!" in a really girly lispy voice that makes them sound rediculous.<br>  <br>  Now here's my take. Homosexuality is "tolerated" today, but it is not accepted. They let gay people... the small, yet very loud and outspoken, minority of gays live together in big cities, and run down the street half naked with rainbow colored flags. These subcultured gay areas are pretty much left alone. They are allowed places like "bathhouses" and other disgusting things, where discrete sex, and one night stands, and all that is promoted freely. It's as these places that fathers and husbands that repress their homosexually get their quick fix, and where a small percentage of openly gay guys can go to get off. These places not only spread diseases like HIV, but it basically promotes sleeping with anyone and everyone. To me, that's not morally correct.<br>  <br>  THESE things, the government has allowed, basically so the loud flames will shut the hell up.<br>  <br>  They DON'T however, allow things, like marriage, that would promote a more normal lifestyle. Give them a reason to hold better morals and goals, and dreams and ambitions.<br>  <br>  Growing up gay, meaning trying to figure out what or who the heck I am... it's kinda degrading when I think about my future when the only visible gays are the ones who dwell in the city, and live lifestyles that are NOTHING like me, nothing like the way I was raised or grew up. I kinda wanna hold a similar life that my parents and family did, and granted... I'm one of those people that would still be ok if I wasn't allowed to marry... but what kind of message is our government sending to gay people.<br>  <br>  All of their policies signal to me that I SHOULDN'T hold a normal, noble, upstanding, proud, dignified, and example setting life... but that I should be like the sub-cultured gays, who live together, as a different people, with different (lesser) moralsi, social norms, and ambitions................ That's not me... I'm more like you... a heterosexual thinking person.... a person.............<br>  <br>  I don't NEED the government to tell me i'm legally attatched to someone... i understand what you mean by that, and I don't CARE if it's not democratic... but I still think that homosexuals need to stop being treated like second class citizens............ and the "loud and proud minority" of them, need to stop acting like second class citizens, and start behaving in more ways in which society can accept them.|`|J7EWQHYJaa	Well, what would you have to gain from marrying someone of the opposite sex? The answer to this question and yours shouldn't be different. If it is, then you have to set aside your automated discriminative thinking before asking that question. Same sex, opposite sex.. what difference does it make when we're talking about marriage and marriage alone. The couple who are of opposite sex can live together and build a "healthy family"? So does that mean the gay couple can't? Also, you can build a very healthy family without getting married. "Getting married" doesn't mean anything alone.. so really.. whether you get married or not.. as long as you have that bond with the other person, it doesn't matter as much whether you have that "title" in society or not. However, there are certain differences because we live in this society.. there are certain benefits and plans, etc., that apply only to families, namely, of married couples. I'm not sure if this is clear but you should get the idea.|`|PskqcnLbaa	It's okay, I understand your question and take no offense.<br>  <br>  I personally believe getting married is more to gain a recognition that you are a couple and as a couple you should receive the same benefits a straight couple would receive.  Whether it is in regards to insurance or just being able to see your spouse when they are staying in a hospital and you are recognized as family rather than a 'friend'.<br>  <br>  But for a lot of couples some view the act of marriage as a symbol of what their relationship is, therefore they get married because they want to; like how some straight couples want to get married as a sign of love.|`|Awblj4Dqaa	why does anyone get married reguardless of gender?  the commitment, love, ceremony?  marriage is just a status, but for some it is a huge deal!  honestly, in my opinion, the government should have no say on who marries who.  if the government wants to ban homosexual marriage then honestly whats next? the government doesn't ban a white man/woman from marrying a black man/woman....it's nobody's place to judge anyone else.  and it's not right that two people who are in love enough to want to make that commitment to be denied a legal marriage.|`|8JGWcHUlaa	I'm not sure exactly, but i know that being legally married gives you more benefits such as sharing certain accounts.

Then there is the right of survivorship.  If you're married, there's no question.  Being the next of kin in case of a medical emergency, not to mention the right to visit him/her in the hospital.  Just little things like that that we are denied on a regular basis.|`|MhfneF0xaa	Your question is entirely reasonable, and very tactfully stated.<br>  <br>  There is an entire range of issues related to this: tax status, ability of a partner to mak emergency medical decisions, joint ownership of property, and so forth.<br>  <br>  I personally feel that there are other legal means of handling such issues, many of which I have pursued myself.<br>  <br>  Many people, however, feel that these issues might be more easily resolved by gay marriage.<br>  <br>  And you have by no means been rude. Yours is a reasonable and intelligent question.

Also, when you love someone, of course there are going to be days where you don't agree and it might feel like they (or even you) don't love them anymore. But you most certainly do love them. There are just those days. <br>  <br>  Love is too complicated. I don't want to say it goes on and off...because it's not that easy.

What's the point if your only going to share a part of you.|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Love technically is a chemical reaction in your brain. It reacts then fades, over and over.

You always have something to hold on to|`|6w7FKrlfaa	75%  makes me laugh...  i can only base this on my gf and i... we have been together for 10 years this year...  and i can honestly say that she's my soul mate...  we love each other 100 % of the time...  we're not perfect of course...  all couples argue..  we don't argue often but when we do... we make it worthwhile...  but even during the fight.. i know that i still love her...  and that we've just gotta sort something out...  doesn't mean i love her any less...   why just settle for 75%...?|`|RiyzkMO7aa	Oh I want to kill my hubby all the time, and I came close once, but then I realized I needed a ride to work the next day so I let him off easy.|`|8TmK8Qklaa	That's his opinion but there isn't any validity to it. You can't accurately use a percentage like that because you are either in love with someone or not in love with someone, there is no gray area.<br>  It's all or none and your professor is a moron who needs to keep his personal feelings out of the classroom.|`|ox4tmOpJaa	Love means different things to different people. Personally I do not agree with what you wrote. In fact it is for one reason. Just because you are mad or disappointed in someone does not mean that you are still not deeply in love with them. When we start a new relationship that seems to be going right our bodies produce a chemical called PEA. As the relationship goes on and the “honeymoon” starts to come to an end, PEA get replaced with oxytocinthe and vasopressin, which are bonding hormones. <br>  <br>  Because of this, with the “honeymoon” gone it is good to have disagreements. It shows the relationship matured the way it should. Without disagreements and periods of anger the relationship has a better chance of ending. Without them one or both would end up smothered.
dFBccLExaa	I guess that depends on how you look at it. <br>  Set has been around way longer than anything related to Satan. <br>  So technically, you need look no further than Egyptians.|`|4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	Nope, Anton LaVey formed the Church of Satan in 1966.  The Temple of Set was formed later by Michael Aquino, after leaving the COS sometime around 1975.  The two organizations have VERY different sets of beliefs.<br>  <br>  I don't know what the heck Eskimo Joe is talking about.  Anton LaVey certainly never claimed to form the TOS.  That would be like John Lennon claiming that he formed Wings.|`|e599f8e9840310f064e7afa7423bfa60aa	No, he just made claims to have been involved in its creation.  His claims were proven false, as was much of what he said...|`|PwD3slrTaa	I'm pretty sure LeVey developed the reach-around.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Michael Aquino started the Temple of Set. He was a part of the Church of Satan, which Anton LaVey founded, but left because he felt that the CoS' vision of Satan didn't fit his own.<br>  <br>  The major difference between the CoS and the ToS is that the CoS is atheistic or agnostic, and the ToS is mainly theistic.
A1yHDCwxaa	I think that in this universe, so huge and majestic, that we are totally insignificant, and thus no evil or stupidity matters. I think it exists, but it doesn't matter.|`|Mtir05v1aa	No. Stupidity is a behavior more than anything.  You can't have a quantity of behavior "in" you.  <br>  <br>  And evil . . . is pretty much just a title applied to things the people in power don't want us to like.|`|kv7QdQHCaa	I think our evil and stupid actions spawn from excessive pride.|`|ZGydteQgaa	of course, were human..|`|AA11690436	Absolute evil exists for us in our interactions with each other and our environment.  Raping a child is always evil, there is no relativism there.  Sticking your tongue in a light socket is always stupid, there is no relativism there.  However, from a universal perspective, none of it matters much in the long run.  When we look at a pond from an observer's perspective, we see a nicely balanced eco-system with what some have described as admirable harmony.  However, if you are the tadpole being eaten by the dragonfly larva, I'm thinking it don't seem so harmonious to you.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Sure|`|PvgZUzHjaa	I know there is stupidity.  Lots of it.  Evil is a concept I rarely use, but I think there are people who are just plain evil.  I don't know if it is born in, as a sort of birth defect, or created by a rotten childhood, or what.  Still, some people are just cruel and selfish to a degree that has to be called evil if there is any point to the word at all.  Adolf Hitler is the standard example, but he is by no means the only one in history.|`|KOecCLjLaa	somone just asked a question as to how people can believe that the Earth circles around the sun as opposed to the other way around... need I say more in terms of stupidity<br>  <br>  in terms of evil... everyone is always to some extent self-serving|`|18a5331fc23bba2ade711a68568a2f8faa	Yes I believe evil exists.

So they came up with race based laws like the "one drop rule" which made anyone with any African ancestry a slave and anti-miscegenation laws (which banned marriages between slaves and indentured servants primarily).<br>  <br>  After making these laws they gave white laborers (except for the Irish, which were not integrated into white society until later in the 19'th century) better jobs and black laborers the worse jobs.  This further divided people and made it so that whites could dehumanize blacks because blacks were seen as a lesser status.<br>  <br>  Then the wealthy whites used the threat that "black people can take your jobs," to further antagonize the relations between blacks and whites (Notice the affirmative action complaints which are common here and are target towards blacks when white women actually benefit the most from affirmative action).<br>  <br>  All that creates what we have today, conflict between blacks and whites that is quite extensive and basically just a "mind f@ck."<br>  <br>  So basically all of this crap between whites and blacks is because of economics and the need for the elite to maintain power.  (You should also notice parallels with what is happening with Immigrant Latinos today who commonly work "lesser jobs"....)|`|v1JBAwSTaa	The largest Minority is now the Latinos, Expect discrimination Between those 2.|`|GTuoRorFaa	Because blacks are so racist, and it pisses the white people off.|`|g6bBORHxaa	There will always be dumbasses.|`|fnBPI4OAaa	We don't need you to be 'alright' with us.|`|pDmTRG82aa	i agree. we need more asian, middle eastern and hispanic trolls<br>  <br>  you know. to even it all out|`|4Vmlf902aa	Well it all started a long long time ago during the African Slave Trade.....lol.|`|2tn8EALqaa	hahahaha...<br>  oh, you were serious?<br>  <br>  Guy below:<br>  There have been so many Asian trolls on here. Only a couple hispanics.

But the truth is, racism exists in all races and in all cultures. It even exists between people of the same race (everyone defines race differently, and they change the definition to exclude those they dislike).|`|HPqCRBq8aa	You need to get out more. All people argue. Just the other day I was in this store and this hispanic couple was arguing with this Middle Eastern guy. It was so funny. The hispanic girl knew English but her guy friend didn't.

The hispanic couple came in with a bunch of pennies and the middle eastern guy wouldn't accept them.|`|fjsczTsMaa	Because Americans are obsessed with White this and Black that.

For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.

That whole idea is flawed, because then you are saying that there is a certain code of conduct that TG's should follow to be ideally TG. We are all different and we are all flawed.|`|65QqZBnjaa	I agree with Black Rose.  She is a PERSON.  I think you're exposing your own insecurities by dumping on her, a person that has NO effect on your life.<br>  <br>  You want a terrible "representative"?

She did not seem very feminine and it reminded me of why - even though I'm gay and should be more tolerant - I have trouble with the "T" part of our community.  If you are going to do this, you should find a way to make yourself look and sound more natural and less - forgive the word please - "freakish".  Otherwise it's almost like admitting you made a mistake or didn't know what you were doing.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to be offensive but I agree, she is not a good representative.

Even if your friend isn't thinking of having a relationship she clearly is very fond of you and is affectionate so I expect she will be flattered that you like her. <br>  <br>  It might be a good idea to tell her next time she hugs and kisses you.

Both of you haven't learned to live a free life by submitting everything to the Lord. If you can stop longing for this and that, and think only of your life after death, you will never face any problem. Whatever we become here or amass here, nothing shall come with us to that life. Only our spirit shall follow us. So, kindly pray to God to enable you to live only for the Lord and he will take care of your needs here. Once you submit your life and minds to his will, just see how beautiful your life becomes. None can steal the peace and happiness from you once your life is in hands. Even if your husband does not cooperate, don't worry; you continue your relationship with God in full faith. He will bring your husband to his feet very soon. Nothing is impossible for God; trust him and live a free life.|`|LpyEAcjeaa	If your husband doesn't want organized religion, it is really no use forcing it on him. It'll just put stress on your relationship (I've seen it happen.) <br>  <br>  Just make it very clear that you would like him to go to church with you, if anything just for emotional support. I've seen how churches treat people who have kids and are not married, and you will probably feel better with him there with you.<br>  <br>  Then again, if he is intent on not attending a church, then you ought to respect that decision. I'm an atheist, and I do not like attending church even though my family does. It's just a very stressful place to be as a non-believer.

There's nothing "powerful" about praying to non-existent supernatural entities. It's actually quite a stupid thing to do. It sure as heck isn't going to save your relationship.

So people will stay in line.Fearing of doing wrong they think there going to hell.|`|N6cCc9dOaa	Because Jesus Christ said it was all real.And I believe anything He says because I love Him.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Because God said it was True -- and God changed my life !!|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Because the Bible says its true.
MMF1YmZZaa	I would say my parents don't support me financially. <br>  <br>  People are nosy  and jealous when it comes to money.<br>  <br>  Try to not let it bother you!|`|HzkRpjhEaa	It means you are rich as long as you are still living with them and they are supporting you.  Consider this: to you it may seem like you don't get any money from your parents (and I do applaud you for trying to make your own money instead of relying on them), but your parents are still paying for the house you live in, the electricity you use, and a million other things that many people cannot afford.  Maybe you don't have cash to blow, but you have a lot that others with less money do not have.  One example is a friend of mine whose parents have a lot of money, and while they don't give any of it to him, they still take him on vacation with them every year.  To him, that's just a part of his life, but to me, it's a luxury that I've never had.<br>  <br>  As far as your friends go - explain to them that, yes, you are very fortunate, but no, you are not spoiled and you have to work for the money that you have to spend.|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	Tell them that ou live on a limited budget and don't ask your folks for cash all the time, that you're trying to make it on your own. <br>  have a great life|`|iIiRVexbaa	NO NO NO NO NO<br>  <br>  unless you get an allowance|`|pd16sn5vaa	Tell your friends this, "My parents are rich... not me."|`|AA10427045	It makes you well off not rich, especially if you're not over 18, unless they make you work then it's like stfu you guys! If you are over 18 seriously, if you're parents are rich and you have to work or are working what does that say about them? Obviously they don't hand it out like that.|`|WeR0E56eaa	no<br>  <br>  tell them its your parents that are rich and not you|`|R2iCzRjsaa	You are not rich because the parents are rich, unless you have a trust fund, or actually money set up in your name.  HOWEVER, if you can ask mommy and dada for whatever you want and then get it most of the time, then your poor mouthing is no more than a lie.<br>  You owe your "friends" nothing of your, or your parents money.  But poor mouthing when you have access to money is sort of a low class lie, as well.<br>  <br>  Best option is to keep your mouth shut about family finances, and get rid of associates you are overly interested in what your parents have.

YupMCYHlaa	You might get very different answers to this one.  Mine might not be your favorite.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in ghosts or spooks or things that go bump in the night.  I think this is all happening inside of you.  I think it's 'all in your head', but I don't mean by that that you are making it up.  Normal human emotions do this to people sometimes.  Their -own- emotions--worries, hopes, fear, imagination, etc.  You probably miss your mom and wish she was there to help you, or at least make you feel better.  You're very emotionally tied up in your sister's baby and feeling sympathy pains.  You have kids of your own so you know what that's about.<br>  <br>  And these things are sort of like mirages.  The more you concentrate on them and try to look at them, they harder they are to see.  You hear something and then you stop and try to listen to it and then you can't hear it.  Is it like that?|`|hTlzSCYlaa	keep following and listening|`|9OOTeQLYaa	probably you are going to get pregnant in the future, but just pay attentions to your dreams because when i was pregnant i used to have dreams of my baby laughing giggling and i asked someone what did it mean and they told me that the baby was healthy and happy, and well really i wanted a boy and then i dreamed that i saw a pink diaper bag and i saw my cousin there so i thought (my cousin is pregnant) but no later i found out i was having a baby girl, and no my cousin wasn't pregnant lol anyways just pay attention girl and wait because tomorrow can be the future ok take care!

I think you already made up your mind.  I don't think he is planning on nothing happening.|`|wuvmciA3aa	i think if you're both comfortable with it, it should be okay. but make sure he knows your boundaries...and since you will be drinking...you should be extra careful.|`|zHN43P4Haa	Not trying to be one of those meanies on this site, but please don't stay over his house.  It does not look good and there will be a temptation from both of you to get into bed- no matter what your intentions are now, especially after drinking...which you actually shoud'nt be doing since you are only 20. Trust me...you will be giving yourself the respect you deserve.  Its time to make adult decisions...you can have fun without drinking.  Infact one of my friends who doesn't drink at parties is always the life of the party.  You'll be able to drive yourself home, be ready for work the next day, and not look like a floosie. It is way to early in your relationship to be staying over nite.|`|HzkRpjhEaa	Here's the thing:  It may wind up being perfectly ok, but considering you're both going to be drinking and this is someone you're not ready to have sex with yet, do you really want to risk it?  I'm not even saying that he would purposely take advantage of you (though of course that should be considered if you don't know him very well), but once you've both spent the night drinking, it would be entirely too easy to wind up in the same bed without realizing what you are doing.  If you do want to stay at his house, take precautions.  Talk to him ahead of time and make sure he knows that you will require a separate bed or couch to sleep on.  If he has that set up for you ahead of time, you're much more likely to wind up there instead of maybe sitting down on his bed when you're tired and drunk, and then deciding it's really too much effort to make up another sleeping spot.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, do what you feel the most comfortable with.  Just be safe.|`|va8quhPtaa	Risk is more expensive than convenience.
f3jZAL1naa	You probably hate girls because (from the looks of it) you hang out with bimbos and jerks. Try meeting nice people for a change and you'll be accepted. <br>  <br>  It also honestly sounds as if you think the only worth of a woman is to date them. If you're honestly going to hate girls because a few of them won't date you then you probably don't see the true value of a person. I'm sorry for being harsh but don't you think it's a little exaggerated to hate a whole gender because a few people rejected you? Maybe there's something just unlikeable about you, did you ever think about that? Don't punish all women because they have their own reasons to reject you. Or maybe you are chasing after superficial girls that can't see your true value? If so, then take my previous advice and meet nice people. <br>  <br>  Sorry for the rant... <br>  <br>  Oh, and don't try to get a girl by being a jerk. If you would let a girl get injured just so you can date her than that just shows that you are more interested in sex and dating than you are of that person. Which further proves why no one would date you seriously because you in turn wouldn't date someone seriously.|`|NMOmRcUtaa	With over 3 Billion women currently residing on the planet, I have to assume that you have only asked out a small percentage of them. :)  Just as all guys aren't alike, we can't assume all women are either.  <br>  <br>  What most concerns me is the situations you have described.  If you are unfazed by women being victimized in your presence, you should probably seek out the help of a professional counselor.  Seriously.  It is unfortunate that you have had the experiences you described.  However, anytime that we become desensitized to abuse and violence, there is a significant problem.  <br>  <br>  If that does reach you, you should consider the fact that by not intervening in the situation you described in your back seat, you could be considered an accomplice to a very real crime if the girl (or her parents) decided to press charges for assault.  You don't want to end up in juvenile or prison because of your own lack of actions.<br>  <br>  Now I would encourage you to place yourself in those girls' shoes for a moment.  Have you given them a reason to not hate men by not having come to their aide?  You had your feelings hurt...that one girl had her face disfigured.  <br>  <br>  I don't mean to judge you or cause you to feel guilt; guilt does no one any good.  I only mean to highlight the gravity of the situation and encourage you to seriously consider how you view the world around you.  A world full of hate will only make us all sick.<br>  <br>  I pray that you find peace.|`|kKSq5VFKaa	Get over being a WOOS first, You would not help a women in need.<br>  If I ever saw that,  I would be there in a flash to correct the situation, and believe me that person would not be doing that for quite a while, And if I did see"My Friend" do something like that he would be on the floor faster than you could say, Abuse|`|alAtUXvyaa	because a lot of the time the mean guys act nice in the beginning and by the time they show their true colors its too late and the girl is scared to leave him.....and if you can witness that kind of violence and not care then you have major issues. there are over 3 billion women on the planet, just because a small percentage of them rejected you doesnt mean theyre all evil...|`|JITTMjasaa	I guess it's easier for you to not care than show compassion and right the wrongs. Don't be a bad person. The more good you do the better the world will be for you. Karma's a B**ch dude be careful....nice answer thorn it's nice to see a man understand
tnRO5gB8aa	check out <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1288495/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1288495/</a><br>  Apparently the spin off is going to be Alice accused of it and center around her in prison. Weather or not she did it is debatable. Apparently the finale wasn't really supposed to clear up that ?|`|Sfs2u5KVaa	I doubt it's Bette <br>  and Alice seems innocent. I heard that she was wrongly convicted and that's why she's is jail<br>  Therefore, it's Niki which totally sucks because I loved Jenny and Niki together and I was hoping they would work it out in season 6<br>  anyways the 6th season sucked. What was Ilene Chaiken thinking?!|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	I think she either killed herself or it was Max. He was the last person out there. And if Bette did it which i highly doubt then he would have seen Jenny in the pool. And if he didnt see Jenny in the pool it means she killed herself. I doubt it was alice because alice was never by herself. The whole time she was at Bette and Tina's she was around other people.|`|7pKc4WKJaa	I really dunno, I am stumped to be honest. I don't thint it was Bette though, Maybe Nikki, But not Bette.|`|RiyzkMO7aa	It was Santa Claus in the Library with the Loaf of Bread!|`|4Vmlf902aa	What show are you talking about?|`|UbvglIS6aa	sigh.<br>  <br>  I thought this was about a real person since I've seen this question about twenty times recently.  There is no show anywhere that deserves this much attention in my opinion.  Maybe someday they'll make one.|`|spbqfjvbaa	She killed herself.  Think about it:<br>  she had suicidal tendancies before.<br>  she was off in her own little world<br>  she always wanted to be the center of attention.  And even though she knew that none of her friends liked her anymore, this would be the biggest thing she could do for attention.|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Easy, Nikki was there because she was planting the stolen film (les girls) at jennys to ruin her since that is what NIkki promised. Alice is completely innocent. I doubt she could hurt a fly with her 5 inch heals. <br>  <br>  Jenny is just such a selfish obsessive freak she commited suicide by diving off a balcony at just such a time that on of her devoted friends could be blamed for her timely demise. Oh jenny, how I hate you,|`|2HKEuugNaa	Yeah I think she accidentally killed herself by falling off the balcony, possibly hitting her head and becoming unconscious on the way down, and then drowning.  I don't think any of the other characters are capable of murder. The last episode sucked by the way, I was soooooo disappointed! I hope the spin-off is good.|`|UyDkYaXuaa	I don'y know.....*cries*

Ldq6ql3vaa	she seems like she's lost btween you and the other girl, and the only way to get w/ her (that is if u want to... ) is to get some balls and talk to her in person like u guys talk while texting! show her that u know what ur doing and bring up u and her both being in a relationship and see how she reacts. mess around with her and experiment stuff with her, even tease her sometimes.... cuddle with her and stuff to show her that u want to be with her! and if she invites u to her house and shows u all the stuff that the other girl is telling her, then she prob. likes u more than her.<br>  u said the other girl is a better version of u cuz she's openly gay, i personaly don't prefer open lesbians, like dykes and stuff! i like girls that look straight but really they're gay!<br>  if u have any more questions, feel free to email me!|`|RBcPCirJaa	sooo... ur a lesbo?|`|WeR0E56eaa	u got me confused<br>  <br>  it would help if you have more coherency to your words|`|bc27bca0091c66c66f4aa1e409b7ff4daa	babe i think you need to ask her if she wants to be in a relationship with you, if u want that. right now it seems shes just in between the both of you.. which isnt cool.|`|392b18ae97259a7518f51868eb7ea463aa	Sounds like this girl is just trying to get your attention by telling you about this "better version of you." Why else would she show you the messages and what not? She wants to let you know that she is a "hot commodity." In a sense, she is trying to put the pressure on you by letting you know that she has other options. (Sad but true.) Your best move was not making a move at all. Don't feel lost, she is just trying to get in your head. Remember, it takes a genius to see the obvious!|`|EjGzWJUJaa	just ask her straight up. if shes texting you and having you over then maybe theres a chance shes attracted to you too. if you ask me her showing you the text, her telling you about her is just a way to get you jealous hehe...thats my opinion though but i totally think you should ask her if she likes you even a little bit.|`|VsaEOX9vaa	Go to her house again, ask her straight out if she's interested in you 'cos you are interested in her.<br>  <br>  Ask if there's someone else and if you have a chance. Be direct, don't beat around the bush. Hearts are at stake here.|`|5a13e4e71861c341cdcba20cf664598aaa	Yes you do need to make a move. Just ask her if she wants to be in a relationship with you. If the answer is no or unclear, it would be best if you moved on. Why should you have to share with anyone?|`|2JW4qsRAaa	Just talk to her about it.<br>  Im sure shell set the whole story straight.<br>  Maybe she feels like you dont like her or something.Possibly trying to tease you to see how your gonna react.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!

That woman would not be "king" however just as her real spouse, Prince Philip, is not a king.  The female spouse of a monarch is generally called a "queen".

AA10105819	Asexuality <does> exist. Someone needs to crack open a book once in a while.<br>  <br>  (Btw, that wasn't meant toward the asker.)<br>  <br>  Asexuality isn't a sin. It's a sexual orientation, that of not feeling arousal toward anyone. One can be straight, bi or gay, and attracted toward one gender or the other, but does not feel the need to act upon it sexually. They don't get <aroused>. Being attracted to one (or more) genders in general is one thing, but having the desire to act out - getting turned on by someone - is another thing. Asexuals can be straight or gay or bi, but just not turned on and don't feel the need for sexual expression.<br>  <br>  Why anyone would say it's a sin is beyond me. Perhaps it's because they don't fully understand what asexuality is.<br>  <br>  Asexual Visibility and Education Network<br>  <a href="http://www.asexuality.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.asexuality.org</a>|`|JO8FKDRhaa	i do not believe so. better not be. after those religious programs are worked on gay and lesbians to make them forget their same sex attractions, there is nothing else that they can be than asexual as heterosexuality woudl be unnatural for them.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	No, Paul exalted it.

rGGymoowaa	Like many a symbol Hot Cross Buns had an earlier meaning as they where pagan in origin with the cross representing the 4 quarters of the moon. During early missionary efforts, the Christian church adopted the buns and gave the symbol of the cross a christian tradition. In 1361 , a monk named Father Thomas Rockcliffe started to a tradition of giving Hot Cross Buns to the poor on Good Friday.<br>  <br>   That makes sense that they would become a symbol of Good Friday as that is the day Jesus was crucified. They became a popular tradition  to have on Good Friday or in latter times for brunch on Easter.<br>  <br>   A popular English nursery rhyme <br>  <br>   Hot Cross Buns!<br>   Hot Cross Buns!<br>   One a penny, two a penny.<br>   Hot Cross Buns.<br>   <br>   If ye have no daughters.<br>   Give them to your sons.<br>   One a penny, two a penny.<br>   Hot Cross Buns!|`|f24a4de342b1375dc37e91955d32d1a1aa	Hot cross buns are a tradition so ancient it was mentioned in the Old Testament - they are the loaves the women made to honor their goddess. The cross is not a Christian cross, which has one line longer than the other, but an even cross that divides time into the four moon phases and/or four seasons - goddess symbols.<br>  <br>  This goddess is Eostre/Ostara/Ishtar, and she is the goddess of fertility and the spring. They are traditional around Easter because that is her feast day.<br>  <br>  Edit: greensho, there is as much proof for older pagan traditions as there is for Christian ones.|`|7kOXKx1iaa	***In many historically Christian countries, buns are traditionally eaten on Good Friday, with the cross standing as a symbol of the crucifixion.|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Signifies the cross that Jesus was crucified on on Good Friday, rising from the grave on Easter Sunday.<br>  <br>  nfd?|`|4b21006f14999f52b2e85e092542486baa	Hot Cross buns at Easter are a tradition in memory of the Cross of Christ. That is why they are associated with Easter in particular.<br>  <br>  It is quite likely that loaves marked out in quarters were used for purely practical purposes before the adoption of the bun. Clearly if you make a large loaf and someone wants to buy a half or a quarter, marking it out makes the process easier.<br>  <br>  There is no historical evidence of any pagan religious significance to these markings. There is no evidence of people using pastry or similar to mark out the cross shape before the bun made its appearance in Christian times.<br>  <br>  KC  : There is no evidence at all for your stuff about the goddess. It is all modern invention.

sfCRwcRCaa	Fair enough.<br>  I like the idea you had, it makes sense.<br>  However, I have another idea. Do you remember being a kid, when you didn't have a care in the world? Everything was magical and mysterious. Then, as you got older, all of that mystery gradually began to fade as you learned more and more about world around you; about how confusing, dangerous, cruel, and unfair it can be. Now those happy and carefree days are gone, and there is no going back. That is what I think of when I think of Adam and Eve; two humans, new to the world, living in a paradise, until they ate from the tree of knowledge, and were cast out of paradise never to return as a result. So it sort of goes along the lines of "with much wisdom, comes much sorrow". <br>  I think that the story also speaks to our natural sense of curiosity. As we grow, we are constantly learning through investigation. Adam and Eve were bound to investigate the mysterious forbidden tree sooner or later, as it is an integral part of human nature.<br>  What do you think of that?|`|AA12070800	I don't think the issue is intelligence, but wanting to be like God, wanting to know everything.  I think the story teaches us that God created humans for capacity for love and intimacy with God and with one another, but we are never content and always want more, or think if we just have that one more thing, life will be complete.  Then when life falls apart because of our pride and greed we want to blame someone else.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	for the millionth time, it wasn't "the tree of knowledge" it was "the tree of knowledge of good and evil" God did not want us to be concerned with what sin was, but when they ate from that tree they had knowledge of evil.|`|pFs71HsHaa	He wanted them to trust His word and follow what He said.

Metaphorically speaking.|`|MdyHKQRGaa	God kept his stash in that tree...|`|jcZnIR1Zaa	If you first accept the theory that God is all knowing, then the fact of Adam and Eve disobeying was not a surprise to God.    <br>  <br>  God created Adam and Eve in perfection, but He wanted we humans to actively choose to be with Him.   To make an informed choice, humans had to be exposed to all the alternatives.    <br>  <br>  So, Eden was the perfect place for the perfect people, but with built-in curiosity and self-will, God know that eventually they would partake in the knowledge of good and evil.   It appears that He was a bit ticked at Satan for interfering, but that too, did not seem to be a surprise.   <br>  <br>  So, humans, through Adam, were ejected from Eden, and the Tree of Life.   This other tree they were free to eat from, by the way.   Evidently it has medicinal value, and through that tree, life would be eternal.   If you look in Revelation, the tree of life grows freely in the New Jerusalem, or "Heaven".    That is probably why we humans now eventually die -- we are forbidden to eat from the Tree of Life.   <br>  <br>  (Adam sinned, not Eve.   Eve was deceived, but Adam was standing right there and did nothing to stop his wife.   And, on top of it all, Adam tried to put all the blame on her!   God asked "What have you Done?" and Adam said that the woman you gave me offered him the fruit and he ate.....   That was willful sin.   Adam most certainly knew better that to go anywhere near that tree.)    <br>  <br>  Anyway, since we took the other path, our lives may be more difficult, but for those of us who listen to the Word of God, we gain a great gift.  That gift is forgiveness, and the remission of all our sin, through Jesus. <br>  <br>  So, to get back to you question, I believe it was a planned thing.   God knew that they would eat the forbidden fruit, and separate from Him.  But He also knew that we would learn and that we would turn back to Him, willingly.   It is a tough lesson, but well worth it in the end.|`|Pr2eOhliaa	i feel that he didnt want them to eat from that tree to test them, and the ultimate test was satan, the serpant, tempting them and lying to them about the tree. eve gave in first, the adam. no sin before that moment had been committed. because of that event we now have the choice of wrong and right, just as they did.|`|uJO0MbShaa	Like all religious manipulators, the object is to keep the sheep stupid and obedient.

I also think that the story is allegorical, not meant to be interpreted literally.<br>  <br>  The fruit was 'the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil'. That's quite a mouthful, so people just say they ate an 'apple'. 8^)  But think of the idea there.  Adam and Eve wanted to have their own knowledge of good and evil.  They wanted to be able to make their own moral decisions.  They wanted to be independent.  <br>  <br>  And what did the serpent say to tempt Eve?  He said it would make you like God!

I'm sure I will get a few thumbs down for saying that, but those people don't have the answers either. The truth is we may never know how we came to be in existence, or what started everything. Our intelligence has a limit. All we can do is guess. :-)|`|HIskrREJaa	I guess logic...

Lack of evidence - The many views that are associated with God, such as creationism, have absolutely no evidence at all. The creationism theory, in itself, is based solely on the statistical improbability of evolution. And when these associated ideas lose credibility, the idea of God also loses credibility.<br>  <br>  2. Superiority - Despite the spirit or teachings of the religion itself, some people automatically become arrogant and see themselves as superior to others.<br>  An American teacher conducted an interesting social experiment. He organized and disciplined his students in a way, much like Hitler did with the Nazis in his regime. The end results were exactly as described above, the students developed a sense of superiority over others, and violence arose from this. Check out the book "The Wave", it's an interesting read based on an actual event. You can also look here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_W..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_W...</a><br>  <br>  3. Security blanket - People use religion as an excuse for intolerance and crimes. Flying planes into buildings was a faith-based initiative. Crucifying Jesus was a faith-based initiative. Hunting Witches were a faith-based initiative. Outlawing gay marriage, while some may disagree, is also largely a faith-based initiative. It's intolerance, and it should not be excused by beliefs. Certainly not from teachings in a 2000 year old book.<br>  <br>  4. No need - I don't need to fill my life with ideas of an imaginary father figure, there's no void to fill.

bVHnNqzBaa	Let me extend your question...<br>  <br>  Many (not all!) people choose Christianity for the reward of salvation or to avoid the punishment of hell. That's known as Pascal's wager. I don't consider these folks Christian or religious at all. To me, a true Christian would accept Christ without regard to salvation, would not crow about being saved, would not condemn others, and would even take that John 3:16 oath of allegiance knowing that their god might hypothetically give nothing in return.<br>  <br>  Isn't the true purpose of spirituality personal development and growth, not the salvation reward? What type of supreme being needs or wants our devotion? I don't think any god would be that shallow. However, the bible says man was formed in god's image. Seems to me the holy book has that backwards: god was formed in man's image.<br>  <br>  What type of parent would eternally refuse to acknowledge their child or kick them out of heaven -- I mean the parents' house -- for disobedience or refusing to pledge their fealty to mom and dad? Ever hear of unconditional love? Does the g-d of Abraham possess that quality? If so, he would still let people into heaven even if they refused to acknowledge Jesus.<br>  <br>  Why is the concept that one can perform selfless mitzvahs and possess moral values without belief in a god so difficult for many Christians to comprehend?|`|AA11623639	WOW,  why would you come to this section of Yahoo and ask a question to Underwear that two people wear at the same time ????

There is no line from Judaism, Christianity through Islam. That is a mere assertion that Muslims make that is totally ahistorical and totally based upon a retrospective theological construction that is polemical in nature, but is practically irrelevant to the historical development of both christianity and Judaism. Christianity has an historical and theological integrity independent of an overarching salvation history model imposed on it by Islamic polemic theology. Christian theology has an independent historical integrity all of its own. The fact that Islam tries to put Christianity in a gunnie sack and run off with it.to serve its own ends hardly demonstrates a serious academic, or intellectual integrity on its own part. Its actions are purely imperialistic. Christianity rejects out of hand the Islamic interpretation of its role within the grand scheme of unfolding Islamic history.

iH7ZB5Soaa	The verses,<br>  'And also others bound together in fetters...' 'And of the evil ones were some who dived for him, and did other work besides....'<br>  state that Solomon (PBH) subjugated jinns, satans, and evil spirits, and preventing their evil, employed them usefully, and they say: the jinn, the most important intelligent inhabitants of the earth after man, may serve him.<br>  <br>  Contact may be made with them. Devils too may be compelled to give up their enmity and whether they want to or not made to serve. Thus, Almighty God subjected them to one of His servants who was obedient to His commands. Through the allusive tongue of the verses, in meaning Almighty God is saying: “O man! I made jinns, devils, and their evil obey one of My servants who obeyed Me. If you too are subjugated to my commands, numerous beings, and even jinns and devils, may be subjugated to you.”<br>  These verses trace the final limits of the calling-up of spirits, and conversing with jinns, like spiritualism, which have been filtered from a blend of art and science and have arisen from man’s extraordinary physical and spiritual sensitivity. The verses specify the most beneficial form of these and open up the way to them. But it is not to be subjugated to jinns, devils, and evil spirits, who sometimes call themselves the spirits of the dead, and to become their playthings, and a laughing-stock, like nowadays, but to subjugate them through the talisman of the Qur’an, and be delivered from their evil.|`|2vf6tu8Oaa	Jinn were true ever used in the time of Suleiman a.s and even until now some egyptians are still using them for predictions method, spells and curing ppl from spiritual sickness.

I don't believe that Jesus came to be King...but rather he already WAS King.  It appears that foreigners (the Wise Men), terrestrial beings (angels), his own friends (Peter), and even those who were once his enemies (Paul) all acknowledged him as King.  In addition, Jesus tells Pilate that he is a king (see last reference in Sources below).  <br>  <br>  I would also offer that Jesus said repeatedly that the Kingdom of God was at hand.  Unfortunately, throughout Christianity's history this seems to have been misunderstood.  This phrase is often interpreted to mean that God's kingdom is only in heaven or is coming...one day.  But, if something is at hand it means that you can reach out right where you are and take hold of it.  I believe this is what Jesus meant.

Here are some things for you to consider.<br>  <br>  Rulers of the day were, as you state, not "sought out" by Jesus. Neither would he have turned them away.  But it is clear they feared him by their actions. We only have to look at the attempts on his life as an infant, and as an adult. And to see how John the Baptist, his cousin, was murdered by royals.  That does not mean all Kings are bad. In fact, Jesus himself was descended from David, not only a King, but handpicked by God to replace Saul, AND a person God Himself describes as a man after God's own heart.  It is also very important to note that it is written that leaders are put in place by God Himself.<br>  <br>  The Jews of the time were confused - and still are - by the meaning of the Messiah to come, tying their hopes to the physical realm, and therefore expecting a physical King.  <br>  <br>  Scripture is clear Jesus, Lion of Judah, Lamb of God, is the King of the Jews, and King of Kings.  But the point is about his spiritual realm.  When earthly, selfish leaders like Herod heard the term King of Kings, they feared being usurped, but never grasped the holiness in their presence.  <br>  <br>  King James of England authorized the mass writing/publishing of scripture, after many Europeans had been slaughtered previously, attempting to print the scriptures.  I'm glad he did. The Catholic church and the Popes worked for centuries to keep the holy scriptures from the common man.  How much sense does that make when Jesus said first we must become as a child to seek the Kingdom of God - in other words, not making things overly complicated, or processes-of-man-oriented, but simply to accept on faith and adore and glorify God. <br>  <br>  Finally, Jesus' real King-ship is best exemplified by several things:  Even as his guards and attackers/tormentors mocked him on the cross, to the point of putting a wooden sign over his head reading "King of the Jews", Jesus was asking his Heavenly Father to forgive them, because "they know not what they do".  He demonstrates consistently, as does the Father, his unconditional love toward human beings. This was not comprehended by those around him as the essence of his Kingship.  <br>  <br>  Jesus will return again. Only God knows the time, but until that time he is seated at the right hand of God's throne.  When he does return, it will be to judge human kind and gather his believers unto him.  May you and I and our loved ones be among those.<br>  <br>  Praise God from whom all good things flow. <br>  <br>  Peace

Some of the things that these people think they are doing correctly are also false.<br>  The original Biblical Greek and Hebrew has been twisted in its "translation" to fit a certain agenda and mindset of the people reading it.  Unfortunately, everyone who reads the Bible nowadays is paying the price in ignorance.|`|pvosPN40aa	Because people want a religion that works for them, that fits their personality.

That is, it's implicity in mainstream Christianity that we cannot help but fail to follow all of the teachings.|`|vJZYIGJBaa	Every person has their own walk with God.

They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Luke 14:12-14<br>  When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return, and repayment come to you. But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, since they do not have the means to repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.<br>  <br>  Explain why these things are not done.|`|1ZuF9FdSaa	Being a Christian, like any other religion, is about choosing something you feel comfortable with.  God is a figment of the imagination that is created on an individual level by each Christian. The construct of "God" follows a basic guideline, (omnipotence, omniscience, invisibility, &c.) but each person manipulates their "God" to meet and agree with their own personal choices.  Whether a Christian's views about smoking marijuana, eating meat, death penalty, abortion, slavery, incest, alcoholism, spousal abuse, homosexuality, &c.  you can bet their "God" agrees with them 100%.  This is only natural, since they create the "God" in their mind. <br>  Want to test this theory?  Find a Christian who disagrees with God.  You will find many who disagree on what God thinks, but none who disagree with what THEY think that God thinks.  How conveineint, eh?  Sort of like a kindergarden child with an imaginary friend.  The imaginary friend will ALWAYS agree with the child who created it.<br>  <br>  This may seem like an off answer to your question, but the Bible works on much the same principle as it is written in flowery prose so is open to interpretation and was also written by many different men with different styles so one can find/interpret various lines to support/refute whatever they want. (See list above... smoking, diet, killing, &c.)   For instance it is one of the commandments not to murder, but stoning people to death is also a recommended sentence for various "crimes".  Choose what part best fits your personal beliefs.  Your imaginary friend is eager to comply!|`|09db70825677bbcf722475d2959af94eaa	Hey - I am Christian and I don't believe everything in the Bible should be taken literally.  The Bible has stories in it that are set at that time and place and in our culture it doesn't quite fit the same way.

But since Adam ate that apple, all of humanity has become slaves to sin, we are incapable of not sinning but thanks to the grace of God we are forgiven through Jesus.<br>  <br>  You may not believe you are born with any sin but I'm 100% sure that sometime in your life you have sinned and while you are a magnificent being made in God's image and everything about you is good and great, even you need the grace and forgiveness of God.|`|LpyEAcjeaa	It establishes a base of power.

There may be no such thing as perfection. On the other hand, everything can be perfect. They're all really relative terms. Religions are religions.. if one can make it all sugary because that's the way most of us like it, then what good does that do?

So infact according to this theory God created man to do incest sex and grow his community...So if you are a true christian or muslim..you have to believe that someone in your family was a bastard...<br>  <br>  So there is no salvation in these two religions as you are a perennial sinner.. only way to get to salvation is to get out of this guilt trap...|`|pmRQDncsaa	We as humans murder our neighbors, are jealous of others, we steal, we lie, we lust. We ARE imperfect and sinners because of our mistakes. We don't know what is right from wrong as a baby making us a sinner from birth. Why should the human race be rewarded for these horrible crimes against humanity? Why should we get to go to heaven? We shouldn't, but God wants us to. He loves every person so much and wants to be with us for eternity, but unfortunately he cannot do that. We should all be in hell, but God sent Jesus as a way for us to be saved from our sin and to join him in heaven. We do not deserve this because we do so much evil in our world. His mercy saved us.|`|HsYg7Fe1aa	because we are imperfect.

Everyone believes in their own method of bringing up their children. The fact that there are lots of ways to bring up children doesn't discredit the others. Everyone believes in what they believe in and there is no way to be completely sure about which religion is correct while we are still alive. Religion relies on faith and while believing in things that you don't have complete proof about may be too hard of a concept for you to deal with, it doesn't mean that everyone who is religious is wrong. <br>  Take judaism for an example. If you know the places to look, you will dicover that there is a stack of proof that judaism is real. There is also proof that it isn't. If you chose to be Jewish, then that is the right religion for you.<br>  <br>  Another thing is even if there is no g-d, religion is a very special thing. It gives you a community and teaches and motivates you to be a better person. It is also a great place to turn when you need help or guidance as religions such have judaism have many great life lessons.|`|ebe3c2b26459019c836fe0d5e547a974aa	This depends on what it takes for something to count as a religion.

JLfSKYPJaa	Ignorance, intelligence and knowledge can all be found in everyones brain without exception.<br>  <br>  Intelligence could be described as a library of knowledge, of which no ones is equal in size. Also like a library the sections of interest vary in size and importance to each librarian or person. Some people are very intelligent in many areas but never venture into sections they are not interested in. Mostly because they are consumed by other interest .<br>  <br>  No human is capable of maintaining complete knowledge of all things regardless of their education therefore all people are ignorant of many things.<br>  To say a persons lack of education makes them ignorant is a stupid statement in itself. Every day of life brings knowledge to some. To each person their personal interest brings knowledge of that interest constantly. Education is only as good as ones willingness to receive it<br>  if you are willing to receive knowledge you are blessed every day and grow stronger every day .

He is believed to have died on March 17, around 460 A.D. Although his father was a Christian deacon, it has been suggested that he probably took on the role because of tax incentives and there is no evidence that Patrick came from a particularly religious family. At the age of sixteen, Patrick was taken prisoner by a group of Irish raiders who were attacking his family's estate. They transported him to Ireland where he spent six years in captivity. (There is some dispute over where this captivity took place. Although many believe he was taken to live in Mount Slemish in County Antrim, it is more likely that he was held in County Mayo near Killala.) During this time, he worked as a shepherd, outdoors and away from people. Lonely and afraid, he turned to his religion for solace, becoming a devout Christian. (It is also believed that Patrick first began to dream of converting the Irish people to Christianity during his captivity.)|`|RWgjnwl9aa	St Patricks' real name was Maewyn who was born in Western Britain he was a son of a British tax collector & his Grandfather was a Ch ristian Monk he was raised as a Christian but at the age of 16 he was kidnapped by Irish raiders & taken to be sold as a slave in County Antrim after yrs of slavery he started to call himself Patricius (Patrick) & went on to teach the Pagans' about Christianity

In another affirmation of Allah’s absolute control over everything, v. 119 has him leading astray these unbelievers: “I will mislead them, and I will create in them false desires; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and to deface the (fair) nature created by Allah.” The last clause, according to Al-Hasan bin Abi Al-Hasan Al-Basri, refers to tattooing. Said Muhammad, “Allah has cursed the lady who practices tattooing and that who gets it done for herself, and also the lady who lengthens hair artificially and that who gets her hair lengthened artificially.” [1]<br>  <br>  It's weird to me that Muslims will take things in certain ways when it is convenient...like fighting verses are ONLY for self-defense in times of war.  And yet, in regards to this verse, they're going to apply it to plastic surgery.<br>  <br>  Isn't that interesting?|`|O4dXv6Wmaa	Doing it just to enhance looks, is yes, haraam indeed.<br>  Correcting, I doubt.<br>  <br>  Simple. Muslim arab singers do not care about what is wrong, and what is not. It is as simple as that. You cant expect everybody to abide by the rules. This is between Allah and them.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	If it corrects you back to your 'natural state of health' than, yes halal.<br>  <br>  If it is cosmetics to 'change' your natural body than, yes haram.<br>  <br>  Edit: Yes, in Iran rhinoplasties (nose construction) is the most popular amongst women. But that does not mean that it is permissible in Islam. Once again that is altering ones natural self. Plus celebs do a lot of things that are at many times frowned upon.|`|kkO87h0Xaa	It's Haram, but human beings have free will. So, anyone is capable of going against Allah (swt)'s ordinance (in this case, altering his creations). I don't see how someone can alter their appearances. It takes so much away from you. It's weird; I've always hated the concept of Plastic Surgery.<br>  <br>  --OH, BTW, this is excluding the health reasons for having Plastic Surgery.|`|vnEdfxeVaa	There is one clear verse in the Quran that it is haram . It doesn't matter how many countries are allowing it , we look at things under the guide of the Quran not under what people actually do . Celebrities are corrupt so they're not a good example . <br>  Changing your looks is like objecting to what Allah has created , it is like telling Him " No God I would prefer if you have created me differently " <br>  <br>  The verse which forbid it is a promise of Satan that one of his ways to mislead us is to tempt us to change what Allah has created :<br>  <br>  Verse : 4:119<br>  And surely I will lead them astray, and surely I will arouse desires in them, and surely I will command them and they will cut the cattle' ears, and surely I will command them and they will change Allah's creation. Whoso chooseth Satan for a patron instead of Allah is verily a loser and his loss is manifest.|`|L2Nde54Haa	haraam? like what...give details plz....|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Salam for you.Yes having plastic surgery just only for correcting bad creation of Allah such as his/her nose is flat and he/she wants to have a sharp nose is haram or not allowed..But having plastic surgery for improving the damaged part which have been destroyed by an accident<br>  is halal or allowed. Muslim singers who have plastic sugeries without accident are haram or not allowedHe/she will have sins.In Iran there  is a common of nose surgeries because the government do not prohibite it and they(singers) do not know the sahih hadith about that.|`|SCkhQc2Caa	Cosmetic surgery may be divided into two categories: <br>  <br>  1 – Essential surgery: <br>  <br>  These are operations that are done to remove faults, such as those that result from sickness, traffic accidents, burns, etc. or to remove congenital defects with which a person was born, such as to remove an extra digit or separate fused digits, etc. <br>  <br>  This kind of operation is permissible. There is evidence in the Sunnah to indicate that they are permissible and that the one who does them does not intend to change the creation of Allaah. <br>  <br>  (i)                It was narrated from ‘Arfajah ibn As’ad that he lost his nose in the battle of al-Kulaab during the Jaahiliyyah, so he wore a nose made of silver but it became putrid, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him to wear a nose made of gold. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1770; Abu Dawood, 4232; al-Nasaa’i, 5161. This hadeeth was classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 824.<br>  <br>  (ii)              It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursing those women who pluck their eyebrows and file their teeth for the purpose of beautification and change the creation of Allaah. Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. <br>  <br>  Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: <br>  <br>  With regard to the phrase “those who file their teeth”, this refers to those who did that for the purpose of beautification and looking younger. This indicates that what is haraam is that which is done for the purpose of beautification; but if it is needed for medical treatment or to correct a fault in the teeth and so on, there is nothing wrong with it. And Allaah knows best. <br>  <br>  2 – The second type of cosmetic surgery is that which is done for the purpose of beautification. <br>  <br>  These are operations that are done to improve the appearance in the eye of the beholder, such as making the nose look more beautiful by making it smaller, or making the breasts look more beautiful by making them smaller or larger, or facelifts, and so on. <br>  <br>  This kind of surgery is not for any necessary reason, rather the purpose is to change the creation of Allaah and tinker with it according to people’s whims and desires. So this is haraam and it is not permissible to do it, because it is changing the creation of Allaah.<br>  ____________________________________|`|MYN4VFJvaa	to correct something like a mole, birthmark, disfugered face due to an accident etc. no- that's not haram. <br>  and since when does Iran represent Islam?

New generation in almost all the countries of this part of the world would like to forget the past, but we still can see some resentment among the Chinese and Koreans towards Japan.<br>  <br>  Therefore, please be rest assured that we in Bangladesh do not hold any resentment towards the Japanese people, rather we are grateful for the help and support Japan extended for the development of Bangladesh.<br>  <br>  Now pls cheer up and forgive people who are ignorant.|`|6NEPcZFfaa	How would there be a race of people who are any prettier or uglier than any other?

e21a15c26fe150cd05b8f03735e6ce4caa	You're in the right place, in my opinion.  The Presbyterian minister will baptize you as well as your baby.  Congratulations, although sometimes I wonder if congratulations are in order -- you are submitting yourself and your child to God, not just making an proclamation of your faith.  <br>  <br>  You are not required to be a member of the church in order to be baptized.  The way Presbyterians believe, at least in my experience, "Jesus loves me (and my kid), this I know, for the Bible tells me so." Professions of faith are for those who wish to be (scripturally) bound to the church in fellowship and discipline.  That would be you, and your baby should be expected to follow when he or she is of an age to do so. <br>  <br>  Talk to your pastor.  Baptism is entry into a covenant relationship with the Lord.  You are long overdue if you're a Christian, and you owe your child the sacrament of baptism and all of its responsibilities as a citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven. You are both God's property, and you are identified with Christ in baptism.<br>  <br>  Added:  By the way, you can ignore "robe." Baptism is not a game of "follow the leader" with water replacing dirt.  Jesus was not covered with dirt.  He was laid on a shelf in a tomb above ground, remember? The emphasis must be on what Jesus has done for us, and although immersion does paint a nice picture, sprinkling and pouring also have a wonderful, and in my opinion better, redemptive symbolism matching Old Testament redemption and verbiage.<br>  <br>  And if babies "can't comprehend salvation, hear the Word, repent, or pray," you REALLY need to have your baby placed in the shadow of the cross of Christ. "Robe" points to himself. Presbyterians point to Christ. Perhaps he(?) needs to do some thinking about his own decisions impacting his own eternity. He already has his reward in the applause he has required.|`|9c27503b79201fde467bfe0f1ef26915aa	I am a christian myself as well, so I have to say that I don't really agree with infant baptism. I think it needs to be a personal choice, just as you are choosing for yourself. I'm not sure how to find a church that you'd feel comfortable with.. I'd say you should just try visiting a couple for a service or two and see which you think you like best, and talk to the leadership, and if the church has a website, read up on it.|`|PwD3slrTaa	I've never heard of a non-observant presbytarian.

You can go to a church and ask the preacher - he'll do it for both of you.|`|ymqWa8GNaa	You appear to be seeking a "rite" or "process" of a religion, but what you and your loved ones need is a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  Jesus was immersed.  This is what the original Greek "baptizo" means - "immerse, or submerge".  Just as we bury a body completely, not 'sprinkle" dirt on the body, so we bury a believer figuratively in the watery grave of baptism to arise in newness of life.  Babies can't comprehend salvation, hear the Word, repent, or pray.  People who have reached an age of accountability can.  So, really, think about what you're doing here. There are decisions impacting eternity. <br>  <br>  Mark 16:16 says, "Believe and be baptized (immersed) and you shall be saved".  It does not say have someone else believe for you. We cannot change the commands of Christ. (Acts 2:38...; 2Kings 5:12)<br>  <br>  When Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist around the age of 30, the Holy Spirit descended in the form of a dove, and God spoke from the Heavens, saying, "This is My Beloved Son in Whom I Am Well Pleased".  We are wise to follow Jesus example.  It is important to note that God annointed His Son's ministry on earth after the obedience of baptism.  <br>  <br>  Please pray about these things. It is critical that you align with God's will in your life.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|AGKOaVEkaa	Ask a missionary of the church of Jesus Christ of LDS and discuss with them regarding religion.

I DARE you to tell me the exact number. Can you? Didn't think so.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: No, the exact number of pi has an infinite number of digits.

To emphasize, a cubit is NOT an exact length, but simply the GENERAL length from elbow to fingertip. PLEASE learn some history and Hebrew culture if you want to have a serious discussion about something so technical.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Here, this is bizarre but funny:<br>  <br>  "This number 3 was only for dummies. Really clever people would recognize that the word for measuring line is usually  (q-w), while in 1 Ki 7:23 it's  (q-w-h). Now establish the numerical value of each word: q+w = 100+6 = 106; q+w+h = 100+6+5 = 111. Now divide 111 by 106 and multiply the outcome with the 3 for dummies. What do you get: 3,141509! Hah! Holy is the Lord!"<br>  <br>  :-P<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: @ zaz....no, no, no...once again, the numbers are ALWAYS rounded. Fractions are almost nonexistant in the Bible, and where they do occure, they are almost always "1/2". Most likely the actual number is something in the range of 9.6 and 30.144, which round to 10 and 30.

The verse says: "He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it." (1 Kings 7:23). If the writer of the Bible had known anything about geometry, even without fractions it would have been thirty-one cubits around. So the Bible really does say that pi is three.|`|BmXEfdOTaa	Your bible has the value of Pi in it? <br>  Wow. <br>  Impressive, even if it is a incorrect.

And they think that atheists and homosexuals are out to destroy that model in some way.<br>  <br>  Many Christians have this delusion that everything was fine in the 1950s, at which time every home had the stereotypical "Leave it to Beaver" church-going nuclear family, and that if everybody could conform to that idea again, the world would be a better place.  History though proves otherwise.  The world was NOT all peaceful like that, families weren't really like the ones you saw on television, and the model simply doesn't work for everybody.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	I can only talk for myself and I'm a Christian(Catholic).  I love everybody, atheists or homosexuals.  I have a lot of friends who are homosexuals, they don't decide to be, they just are.  As for atheists, as long as we respect each others view, I don't have a problem with talking or being friend with them.  I saw a few answers on yahoo! answers that makes me feel that atheists hate me but I might be wrong.  I hope I am because I never hated anybody.  Hatred is like a cancer for me.  I never hated anybody but I disliked somebody once and it made me real sick.  I guess I wasn't born to hate people.|`|hQDapmICaa	We hate them?

I guess its the same reason other Baha'is hate us Orthodox (Tarbiyat in my case) Baha'is and use some small quote to condone intolerance to homosexuals in a horrid way.<br>  <br>  Neither of the Prophets Jesus or Baha'u'llah said anything bad about atheism or homosexuals, its just the followers who were atheophobic and homophobic.|`|kR8S9jTyaa	erm, is this a real question?<br>  <br>  because atheists/homo's (one and the same really) are evil sinful people, people so depraved and wicked that they seek to destroy the very moral fabric our great Christian country was built on. they force rediculous lie's on our kid's in school (big bang anyone? monkey's came from nothing by accident then we came from monkey's? yeah) and wont rest until we are living in a cesspit of sodomy.|`|DuyuUJNDaa	How about an 'unreal' response - rubbish.|`|CEQpDpnPaa	hate the sin, love the sinner|`|2ffF6imOaa	Most of my friends are atheists and I have no problem with homosexuals. I have a close gay friend that's probably the most wonderful person you would ever want to meet. So don't judge me before you know me. I honestly don't care what you worship or even if you don't worship anything. I'm not going to let that get in the way of seeing people for who they really are. If you're nice to me, I'm nice to you regardless of your religion, sexual orientation, or any kind of background.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: What do you mean when it's convenient. No time is convenient. What the **** do you want? You complain about christians not accepting people, but when somebody finally does you offend them. Yeah, cause that's so much better. Really. You are just in a nasty attitude. You don't know me, nor will you ever, so don't judge me. It seems you are turning into what you preach against.|`|b0qKOoBRaa	I am a Christian.  I have many homosexual friends.  I love them.  <br>  <br>  I definitely realize that many Christians have a hard time with this.  From my perspective, it's mostly that those Christians have a hard time refraining from things like pre-marital sex, drinking and other things that they believe are wrong, but still want to do.  Picking out something else to hate lets them feel better about being hypocrites because they feel that they are at least doing better in terms of "how bad" you can sin (even though this is incredibly inaccurate and wrong)... <br>  <br>  We (Christians) are not perfect.  This is only one reason among many reasons that many different Christians act the way that they do toward homosexuals.  There is actually a LOT of variation between Christians and the specifics of what we believe and how we translate that into our everyday lives.  <br>  <br>  I try to view each person as having their own completely unique set of life experiences and beliefs built on them, whether they are Christian or atheist, agnostic, Muslim, Buddhist, Shinto or whatever.  <br>  <br>  I personally would appreciate if Christians were not lumped together into a giant category that automatically assumes our political leanings and social behaviors based on one commonality.  But, since many Christians do this to you, I understand the tendency.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you haven't met anyone who lives up to your standards of Christianity... The Bible makes it clear that no one but God Himself is perfect, so it is likely you never will meet a Christian who can live up to what a Christian "should" be.  This is why we have Jesus and forgiveness, but I'm not a preacher, SO I'll leave it at that.  If what you want is to witness perfection, it's God that you're seeking, not Christians themselves, we are merely dinged up mirrors reflecting warped images of His true glory and perfection.|`|ebe3c2b26459019c836fe0d5e547a974aa	You are correct in saying that Jesus says to love all people.  When the woman caught in adultery is thrown before him he sends those condemning her away by saying, "If anyone is without sin let him be the first to throw a stone."  This is a picture that our world loves because it shows someone not bringing down judgment on someone.  But that's not where the story ends.  Jesus then tells her to go and sin no more.  In these words Jesus says very clearly that she has been sinning and needs to change her ways.  But he did it in a loving protective way and in a forgiving way.  I don't think it is accurate to say that Christians are out there hating homosexuals and atheists.  Of course there are some but there are just as many non christians out there hating homosexuals so it's not fair to heap stuff onto Christians.  By simply saying that homosexuality is sinful I would immmediately be labeled as judgemental in todays world.  In the same token Jesus would have to be labeled as judgemental because he told the woman she was a sinner and needed to sin no more.<br>  <br>  And I'm sorry but saying that something is a sin because God said it was it and always will be a complete answer.  God defines sin so when answering a question about why is homosexuality a sin, pointing to the one who made the rules is as easy an answer as you can get.|`|R1lvg62Waa	I'm christian and i don't hate either groups of people<br>  god wants us to accepting of all kinds of people<br>  we are told to love everyone <br>  and that means everyone<br>  atheists<br>  homosexuals<br>  even your worst enemy<br>  he loves them and he we need to love them too|`|kvfUHYRPaa	a christian hates no man or woman,but the works of evil he or she does hate as god himself hates them to.

hTlzSCYlaa	It's called for God's will, but maybe it's just for sex.|`|rOXGLKwuaa	Well depends on what you are really asking, in a mythological sense the interactions were more of a physical one (and in most of the Greek mythos, using themany amorous pursuits of Zeus as an example of a self fulfilling nature). Now on a deeper modern day level, they are more likely only serving as archtypes to be used as focusses or as examples of what we want to be or achieve in life. They are also used by those of the pagan beliefs to aid and guide them in their ritual life and their day to day life

But the first step is to recognize that the bullying isn't about you. The bully doesn't care who he bullies, and in some ways, your behavior has nothing to do with what he does.  <br>  <br>  The kind of bully you describe is all about keeping his buddies.  He does what he does because of his relationship with them.  Very often, the reason he picks on you is because he senses the need to impress one of them.  Everything he does in his interaction with you, he's really reacting to how his friends react.  <br>  <br>  So maybe the solution, if there is one, is in observing the friends.|`|my2Y8PXSaa	Envied is the man without enemies; however, if you feel the need to overcome an enemy you cannot turn ally try using ur brains to fight back<br>  <br>  <br>  idk photoshop a pic of him being anally penetrated and subtly move it around the school?|`|OCbbEXCcaa	A napkin and heresine.|`|jpVFYgHraa	go to gym and beat their ***...|`|sz7IbBjpaa	well start training do running,skipping and start lifting weights and when you ready start and join boxing gym and learn to box....in three months you will learn how to fight cause boxing is about padding this will help you in short time but if you want to be the best fighter try dong martial arts also...learn all kinds of fight techniques as you know the more knowledge is better.....i used to get beaten in fight before but since i learnd how to box no one have ever been able to beat me.....and also try to gain power do lots of heavy weights lifting begin with light weights as you grow stronger start lifting heavy onece.....and do a lot of long distance running....and skip ropes this will help your movements when you are fighting.

yFgckz5Uaa	the number 13 is believed to be a bad luck,|`|g2JqGIOCaa	Not all hotels, or other buildings, follow that..  I've seen plenty of hotel rooms and floors numbered 13.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	REMEMBER  APOLO 13<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Thirteen may be considered a "bad" number simply because it is one more than 12, which is a popularly used number in many cultures (possibly due to it being a highly composite number). When a group of 13 objects or persons is divided into two, three, four or six equal groups, there is always one leftover, "unlucky" object or person.<br>   <br>  The Egyptians were the first to develop a superstition for the number thirteen, but for them the number brought good luck. They believed that there were twelve steps on the ladder to eternal life and knowledge and to take the thirteenth step meant going through death into everlasting life. Thirteen, for the Egyptians, was associated with immortality.|`|cxXU2748aa	Hotels don't have a thirteenth room (And sometimes no thirteenth floor either) because people are paranoid. 13 is an unlucky number, so nobody wants to stay on a thirteenth floor or a thirteenth room if it's unlucky.<br>  13 is unlucky for several reason. For one there were thirteen people at the last supper and Judas (The betrayer) was the last o0ne to sit down, meaning he was number thirteen. There's also things like "the Jews murmured 13 times against God in the exodus from Egypt, that the thirteenth psalm concerns wickedness and corruption, that the circumcision of Israel occurred in the thirteenth year," and so on. (All have to do with Christinaity)<br>  Also some other resons for the superstition are that in many a twelvemonth, to use an old term, there are 13 full moons, and a woman on a 28-day menstrual cycle will be "unclean," as Leviticus has it, 13 times a year.<br>  Another reason is that 13 is one past 12, the dozen, almost universally regarded as a perfect number, signifying harmony and all good things. Thirteen, by contrast, is a number of transgression, taking matters one step too far, turning harmony into discord.<br>  <br>  of course, once a superstition has been made and the human mind forms into patterns so that every time there's a number thirteen people will strongly remember all the bad things that happened but generally none of the good things. I could go on but I don't want to bore you.|`|g9s3tcgGaa	Number 13is bad luck so they skip that floor just supersticouse I

The problem here is people have been telling you what they want you to believe and not the truth. <br>  Homosexuality can affect your life negatively only if you allow it to. Really it is no different than drinking and driving. If you do that you are going to have problems. If you go to the bath house and allow everyone in there to fill you up then you are going to have a problem. All Gods people are the same, they all have the same chance to do the right things in life, if you do not then life is going to be bad.Forever. It is possible to be a christian and be gay, sober,drug free, monogamous,professional, and happy. Just stop listening to bigot's and you will be freed from the lies.|`|14d3582ec54c1fd8d9308f10a9cd5dc8aa	It's called make believe or the powers of the imagination. <br>   <br>  One could try to have sex with a person of the opposite gender while fantasizing about someone else, but it probably still wouldn't be pleasant. <br>   <br>  All of that "turn straight" stuff is rotten bologna.|`|pB55nws3aa	There's no proof that god exists, and there is no proven way to "turn straight".

And I am going to assume that you are attracted to men, given your question. <br>  <br>  Here's my answer... You're going to meet and fall in love with a really hot guy at some point.. Maybe tomorrow, maybe next year, who knows (I don't know how old you are, what your circumstances are, etc...  a lot will depend on that.)  And when you do....... trust me...... when you are with him, you are going to think to yourself, "Wow, I am SO glad I'm gay!"   And will agonize no more..  <br>  <br>  And then, you'll have girls who from time to time try and flirt with you, and you'll be totally NOT turned on by them, and just be thinking, "I'm so glad I'm not straight."  <br>  <br>  At least this as been my experience (but as a lesbian).  Be joyful. :)|`|SIFyxFFpaa	don't leave so fast.<br>  <br>  was gayness so bad?

fYeu6vE6aa	I didn't have much cash when I was 15, so I'm assuming you'll want something fairly cheap. Here are some ideas:<br>  <br>  1. Make a scrapbook of family pictures. Can get lots of pretty scrapbooking material from local stationary stores or the dollar store for cheap. Moms tend to love pictures, and sentimental stuff.<br>  2. If you have a friend who's really into photography, or if you can set the autotimer on your digicam, gather your family together for a cute and recent family portrait. Get it printed and frame.<br>  3. If your parents have old photos, you can make a project of scanning them all and recording them onto digital media for safekeeping. It's nice to have the digital copies of old pictures.<br>  4. If there's a big chore that needs to be done, do it. It's spring cleaning time. Is your garage full of clutter? How your mom been complaining about a big task that needs to be done? Take the initiative and clean it all. It may seem like a silly present, but helping your mom out really shows her that you care.<br>  5. Spring is on its way; if she likes gardening, get her seeds or bulbs of her favourite plant for her garden.Package them nicely. <br>  6. If you can sew, make her a carry-all bag with a cute design. <br>  7. Make a gift basket or box of sentimental things. It can be as expensive or cheap as you like, just attach a small note to each object you include to explain it (or explain it as she is opening it). For example, you could put in a jar of honey ("because your the the sweetest Mom")...or put in chocolates that she likes. However, you can also add random things. Like if you guys have inside jokes, put items that have to do with your jokes. Or tokens from your favourite places. Or items that represent things that she likes. Decorate your keepsake box nicely.<br>  <br>  Moms tend to love sentiment; focus your gift on: memories, and telling her how much you appreciate her, and showing her how important she is to you.<br>  <br>  With any gift, get or make a card, and write a message that comes from the heart. :)|`|va8quhPtaa	Just a free chat with your mom remembering her sacrifice in bring you up.|`|gnIEDg6maa	How about some home made coupons offering to do things for her?

Jehovah's Witnesses are some of the most respectable Christians out there.  You were the one that let them in.  So I'm sorry for you that you are so insecure in your own beliefs that you let people into your house to preach something different, but hey, that's your problem.<br>  You would "love to tell them to bug off or tell them what you think of them?"

Naturally they were excited to convert me so they came back twice a week, each time different people. Finally I was expecting them so got my friend to answer the door looking as goth as possible and holding a knife and splattered an old shirt she was wearing with blood [steak for dinner]. Everytime they spoke she'd hiss or growl. Then after they were starting to get creeped out I'd come out from behind her and whisper loudly 'the devil came to visit..wanna come in?' Then my other friend screamed loudly "Come back and eff me more Satan!" from the back of the house.<br>  <br>  They never came back. Very blasphemous!<br>  <br>  Second time was at this new house. Now this was purely coincidental. But they answered the door and I told them I had found my own faith in satan ..and the wind picked up.. and when the wind goes theres a pipe that howls like a ghost. So the place was howling very creepily. Then my little sisters starting screaming from the pool because a toad jumped in. I recognised their 'omg its a toad' scream so I started laughing. <br>  <br>  They also never came back.|`|hj76FSKdaa	Just make a proposal to them, basically a fair trade.  Tell them that you will read their literature and meet again to discuss it, but they have to offer you the same courtesy.   So suggest that you study Watchtower literature during one week and Christian literature the next week.  They won’t be able to do that because they would be disfellowshipped for reading apostate material.  And if you get disfellowshipped, then you would go to hell.  So that should end the conversation quickly.|`|2RygPGRaaa	Being a Christian you should act like a Christian and be good to these Jehovah's witness. Don't forget you are witnessing to them when they come to your door by the way you are living your life.<br>  <br>  This is what my pastor does when they come to the door. He tells them "I'll give you 5 minutes to speak, if you give me 5 minutes to speak"|`|28216207e17752f6c782dd9a28e07f1faa	Put a "No Solicitors" sign on the door.

They can see me and I can see them, but I ignore them so they go away.

AA10024451	So you want a Bible scripture to use to try and "make them look stupid". Um....ok. There's a real mature attitude you have.  (And by the way....."thell" isn't a word.)<br>  <br>  Considering that Jehovah's Witnesses use the Bible to defend all of their beliefs and teachings, you're not going to find one to "make them look stupid". I suggest you grow up a little and re-examine your motives.<br>  <br>  (If you want to share your own beliefs, why do you need someone from Yahoo! Answers to give you a scripture? Don't you know the Bible yourself? Are you incapable of looking through it for some scripture to discuss?)|`|AA11025703	Using the Bible to try an make someone feel stupid, doesn't seem exactly loving, to me.<br>  <br>  I am a Christian, one of Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I've known quite a few people who became Witnesses because they wanted to use the Bible to make some/a Witness feel stupid.<br>  <br>  "they tell me bout there religion when they dont read all of it"<br>  <br>  I presume you are claiming we don't read all of the Bible??  If so, you are incorrect.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to talk with us, Simply say so.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  As for early comments, having a Flag, of any national group, or saying "I am wiccan" or anyother religious group won't makke us "run away".|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Hereby perceive we the love of God, because He laid down His life for us;.....I John 3:16.<br>  <br>  Remember, they do not believe Jesus is God.|`|pFs71HsHaa	They can be very persistent but if you are direct and to the point that you do not believe as they do and you will not debate with them (they will ask you to prove why you believe as you do) and you want them to not return to your home they will listen and leave you alone.<br>  If you don't know the bible verses that you would use then please don't try and debate with them. This is what they are trained to do.<br>  If you insist on debating them use your own bible and dont let them quot from their bible or use their "other books" that they use.<br>  You can google "Arguments against Jehovahs Witness" and see the basic point most Christians disagree with them on, but I still recomend that you just send them on their way.|`|wRBfUgI2aa	I think you should just grow up a little.  Jehovah's Witnesses know what the Bible says as it is the standard they use for what they believe.  Since you have never been taught or evidently tried to learn, maybe you should stay out of any attempts to make anyone "look stupid".<br>  <br>  Consider if you have ever asked God for meaning or truth.  What happened?  Did you hear a knock at the door soon after?|`|BzrUWCsDaa	I'm afraid its impossible to make them look stupid using scripture as Jehovah's Witnesses are well versed in the bible<br>  <br>  Next time they call why don't you agree to a bible study with them (using your copy of the bible) & try to prove what they're saying is wrong?|`|QNNOCf4Kaa	I gotta agree with you using your Bible. Try to make them prove their own beliefs by using your Bible instead of theirs. That should really stump them and then they will flee. In fact, "kill them with kindness" and invite them in to study with you but insist on using your Bible. Better yet get about 2, 3, or even 4 different versions but do not let them use their Bible and see if they can prove their beliefs that way. Think about it, all those different Bible versions and they won't be able to use their Bible. I'm sure if someone's faith were built upon the truth of God's Word they surely would be able to prove their faith no matter what Bible was used, right? Think of the challenge this will present to them. Will they honestly be able to pull this off. What do you got to lose trying? Show them what you believe and see if they can respond?<br>  <br>  However, what if they can prove their beliefs with any Bible? Now that would be something to look into, wouldn't you agree? I know if someone could show me something in the Bible that was undeniable I definitely would be interested in what else they had to say.|`|b5PjQzEYaa	Just tell them that you want to be placed on their Don't not call list and if they come back you will call the police. As for discussing the bible with them. They have the mind set that they are right even if you give them scriptures and use their own publications to prove your point. They will not believe you. Trust me I did those things. Just keep in mind that witnesses are blind followers of an organization that uses fear to keep them there.|`|GKgmyEfnaa	Tell them you're a Wiccan and they will leave you alone.  If you're a Christian and find that a little unpalatable, just politely, but firmly ask them to leave you alone.  Don't enter into any further discussion and if pressured, repeat your desire to be left alone.  Worked for me.|`|rdEm25fEaa	Dude, that's harsh.

Ao52XHjCaa	LOL. I believe Scared Straight is a program where kids and troubled youths are sent into prisons to listen to discussions from inmates, correct? Yes, don't worry, she will be safe. She is not going to be around dangerous criminals-they are very carefully screened and will be with guards at all times.

I do not get anything done and I do not feel like changing anything.<br>  When I feel like I am working towards a point, I feel so different. I feel important, motivated, focused, and excited. I feel like it is worth me putting my time and effort in and achieving something. I feel worthwhile.<br>  <br>  <br>  That does not mean that life is worthless, as some human try to say. Nor does it mean the next logical step is nihilism. <br>  To make life interesting and seemingly worth living, there has to be a point of some kind. The great thing about there being no real point to life in general is that it leaves us free as individuals to choose our own destiny<br>  Life is for living in and of itself.

If she's seeing something that you aren't it's a matter of interpretation, not a matter of something invisible to your eye.<br>  <br>  Update: I suppose as stated below me that it is completely possible that she saw something in that corner that interpreted as non-threatening, such as a shadow. She may connect this shadow with that portion of the room and still be a little wary of it. She also may have had a dream involving that area of the house that was unsettling to her, and remembers it when she sees that room. Another possibility is that there was a strange person there at one point, maybe a friend of yours that she had never seen before that she didn't like, and is afraid that he or she might come back.

Satan and his demons are not THE most powerful creatures in the universe but they are invisible and they are devious and they are out to get you.  I Peter 5:8 says Keep YOUR senses, be watchful.

As you pull away be prepared to really piss him off too.<br>  <br>  Why do I say demons rather than ghosts or spirits of the dead?  Good question.  That goes to the teaching of the condition of the dead:<br>  <br>  The first lie in the Garden of Eden was “you positively will not die” Genesis 3:4  then King Solomon was inspired to define death in Ecclesiastes 9:5 where it says “the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all…” much like heavy sedation during surgery.  We have no awareness of the passing of time, right?  There are more scriptures, that’s just one.<br>  <br>  When the clergy contradict Ecc 9:5 and teach that we all have a spirit inside us that in death goes to heaven (which does exist) or a fiery hell (which is not taught in the Bible) they are simply perpetuating Satan’s lie!  They will be held accountable.<br>  <br>  So, does that mean there is no hope after death? NO In fact, the truth is even better than what most people struggle to believe.  Your daddy is asleep waiting for a resurrection in a paradise earth.  It’s true.<br>  <br>  The fact that you grew up Catholic, and the beliefs are familiar, does not mean you have the truth.  Please make the effort to study God’s word and ask for His help.

Sometimes it's because the parents can't be bothered with them and it's easier to toss them outside. They don't have the tools to handle them. It's not really their fault.

kCjRaNT2aa	I can see your point. For shias, mutah is a form of marriage with no particular intention to continue it for life. In fact, there should be a defined limit, from what I understand, and the bride should be given a dowry, just as in the traditional permanent form of marriage practiced by both shias and sunnis. <br>  <br>  You could look at this from a few different perspectives. One, he's really just a non-religious guy with a religious family and he tried to settle the family in a religiously acceptable way for what was to him a typical dating relationship. Two, he really didn't want anything permanent with you, but wanted internal justification for having sex to assuage his religious guilt about it through this type of arrangement. Three, he thought it might be good to try a mutah marriage before going ahead with a permanent marriage to test it out. I've heard of shias thinking like that.<br>  <br>  I would say don't worry about what anyone thinks about you. Maybe some think badly of you, but surely it isn't any more badly than they would have if you were just a typical girlfriend strictly Western-style. In the end, YOU have to live with your choices, and if you thought the choice was right for you at the time, then who cares what anyone else thinks? We all live and learn from our choices, if we're smart. <br>  <br>  I understand your wanting to think of him in a positive way because of what it would do for your healing process. Why don't you ask the only one who can really help settle that for you, which is your ex? Ask him to be honest and to tell you what he was thinking at the time, just to help your healing process and that you will listen without offering judgements or recriminations.  No matter what he says, it will answer unanswered questions that are making closure difficult for you. Maybe he will be open with you and you will feel better for it. Good luck!|`|OCg8zOH2aa	Hi ..<br>  im so sorry that some shia bastard did that to u ..<br>  Please dont get a wrong image of muslims for what he did.

Let us throw off these 2000 year old chains and marry our siblings.  Let us commit fornication and theft.

They both already have the other twin's blood, so transfusing the blood from one twin to the other is TOTALLY and ABSOLUTELY harmless.

DtlQawvgaa	Acts 15:19-21,28 is the Scripture the JW cult typically point to as the reason they refuse to accept blood donations. <br>  <br>  Acts 15:20 says, "Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood." <br>  <br>  It is clear from the context that the instructions were against eating / drinking blood, not blood transfusions. Blood transfusions were not even possible in Bible times, so there is no possibility that this Scripture could be referring to blood transfusions. There were many pagan religious practices that involved eating and drinking blood and/or strangling an animal to keep more of its blood in its meat. <br>  <br>  The Scriptures and all people recognize the difference between eating or drinking something as a food for nourishment or pleasure, as compared to taking the same thing for medical treatment (see 1 Tim. 5:23).<br>  <br>  Jw cult history on Blood:<br>  <br>  After Russell's death in 1916, Joseph Franklin Rutherford succeeded Russell as president of the Watchtower organization. Under his administration Jehovah’s Witnesses depicted uses of blood as heroic and the Lord’s work.<br>  <br>  In 1925, blood transfusion was mentioned in an issue of Golden Age. It reported on Mr. B. W. Tibble who donated blood on forty-five separate occasions. The article highlighted his refusal of payment for donating, and the honor accordingly bestowed upon him by Order of the king.<br>  <br>  In 1927 the Watchtower organization addressed blood, stating, “God told Noah that every living creature… must not eat the blood…”.<br>  <br>  In 1931 this was expounded by the Watchtower organization teaching “that it was not the eating of the blood that God objected to, but it was bringing the blood of the beast in contact with the blood of man.” At this time the Watchtower organization taught that human blood was sacred and that it was wrong to contaminate human blood with animal blood.<br>  <br>  In 1940 while discussing interesting medical news, the Watchtower organization reported on a woman who accidentally shot herself with a revolver in her heart and survived a major surgical procedure during which an attending physician donated a quart of his own blood for transfusion.<br>  <br>  After Rutherford’s death in 1942, the Watchtower organization (under Nathan Homer Knorr’s administration) wrote in 1944, “the stranger was forbidden to eat or drink blood, whether by transfusion or by the mouth” and that this applied “in a spiritual way to the consecrated persons of good-will today, otherwise known as “Jonadabs” of the Lord’s “other sheep.””<br>  <br>  In 1945, the application of the doctrine on blood was expanded to prohibit blood transfusions of whole blood, whether allogeneic or autologous. While the prohibition didn't specify any punitive measures for accepting a transfusion, by January 1961 it became a disfellowshipping offence to conscientiously accept a blood transfusion. This represented an admitted shift toward increased strictness by the Watchtower organization imposing additional obligation upon the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses. As part of this doctrinal shift, the Watchtower organization warned that accepting a blood transfusion could prevent them from living eternally in God's new world.<br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|AA10024451	Nobody's blase about their meat.

This question cannot be addressed with a simple answer, nor do I think you would be content with any answer you get FROM JW's, no matter how Bible-based or medically sound it was. But I still am going to try, so at least others who do not know about the group of people here on Y!A whose sole intent is to slander JW's.<br>  <br>  Acts 15:20 is an actual Bible verse that commands we abstain from blood. This is not something that JW's made up. The King James Version says it this way: "But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood."<br>  <br>  This is a side point, but it behooves me why people don't accuse the JW's because they strive to abstain from idolatry & immorality, yet most religions in the world practice these things without blinking an eye. So it's no wonder that giving blood transfusions away like it's candy is widely accepted as "okay" among Christians, since they ignore the rest of that verse & the rest of the Bible's laws & principles.<br>  <br>  But back to your question. Since Christians are commanded to abstain from blood, we do our utmost to avoid it. God did not instruct us to abstain from blood unless it's for some medical procedure, it merely & plainly states to ABSTAIN FROM BLOOD.<br>  <br>  We do not wait on the Gov' to tell us what is safe to eat. We make sure of it ourselves! If there's any doubt in our minds that something contains blood, we will NOT eat it. Even if it doesn't really have blood in it, if we do not know, we do not take that chance. I heard once that Botox may contain blood bi-products. So you will never see me in line for Botox. I don't know for sure, I'm not a chemist. But if I don't know for absolute sure something doesn't have blood products in it, then I will not partake of it. All JW's do this! It's not a hard thing to do either. It's simple really, we don't eat food that contains or even MIGHT contain blood. <br>  <br>  In some countries blood is in many products & foods, in those countries JW's have to be especially careful to avoid those things completely. & they do. In the USA it's a lot easier as it is required to list ingredients of all food products. If something is questionable then JW would NOT eat it. It's not that big of a deal, no need to strike up an argument over something as frivolous as what JW's eat for lunch. PLEASE!<br>  <br>  As far as the blood transfusions go, it is obvious you have ignored all the accurate & complete information you received about this already. We of course would never just let our children die if a Dr. said they needed a blood transfusion. We're not evil, we're not idiots. & We have told you repeatedly that there are so many alternatives to blood transfusions, ones that are proven safer, more sanitary & superior then actual blood transfusions. Medical doctors of all faiths & backgrounds are accepting these alternatives into their practice more & more. A simple search on Google prove it, but if you or anyone wants to know more detail, please visit: <a href="http://www.watchtower.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org</a> & run a search for "Blood transfusion" & you will get tons of medical & scientific explanations as well as numerous Bible based information. Or see this article for starters: <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/hb/article_03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/hb/article_0...</a>|`|a1Df6E3Gaa	Well as Jehovahs witnesses we study the bible and we are told there that we shall not accept any form of blood and we believe that accepting blood is also not sanitary because some people have also gotten diseases from blood transfusions. We also respect the bible where it says to maintain our body free from contamination.

One person can think you're perfectly mature and another can think you're a total nitwit. I prefer to think of the latter as stuffy, self-important jerks. Technically you don't have to be socially mature in any body's eyes to have sex, you just have to be physically capable. Tell the person who told you off that you're going to live your life your way, and then take a step back and think about your actions and what can happen to you if you mess up. I know you're 18 and an adult and kudos to you for standing up for yourself, but make sure that you believe in what your doing because you believe it is your right, not just because you're rebelling. People tend to trip up when they aren't doing things for the right reasons.

D6FBLQfwaa	I'm not a believer in the Antichrist myself, but the book of revelations indicates that the Antichrist will come from "the sea" which symbolizes the world of politics. The fact that god supposedly installed humans with free will probably means the person will choose to take up the role of Antichrist, either after being offered the role, or symbolically acting as "the Antichrist". In either event, the fact that the Antichrist comes from the world of politics proves that people will have the Choice to follow him/her or reject him/her.|`|e599f8e9840310f064e7afa7423bfa60aa	If the antichrist gets to choose, I want the title.

Even when they saw Him, heard Him, and witnessed miracles performed by Him? <br>   It is evident they would rather accept the word of someone else claiming that He wasn't who He said He was, that He was a deceiver, had a devil, was going against the Law of Moses, performed miracles by the power of the devil, regularly broke the Sabbath, had the audacity to claim that God is His Father, etc. etc. etc.  Thus were such people so caught up in being wrongly led against Jesus that few bothered to humble themselves before God to gain the Spirit's witness that He is indeed the Son of God, the King for whom all Israel had been waiting.  Now the world, or much of it, gladly anticipates the Second Coming of Christ, yet most of their number still will not accept The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as being restored by the Savior through the Prophet Joseph Smith specifically to prepare them for the Second Coming.

This civilization supposedly lasted between 2700 BC and 420 AD.  The Book of Mormon supposedly is a historical record of "God's dealings" with this civilization.  When archaeolgists searched this mountian in order to substantiate the claim, they couldn't find "any" evidence of anyone living there, not even Indians.  Now that the Mormons own it, no one is allowed to do any digging there.  Now why is that?<br>  <br>  I believe that God saw ahead of time the cult of Mormonism and that God found an ingenious way to expose the lie.

I am not so sure, but in the end it doesn't really matter. <br>  <br>  Some Mormons are a bit crazy and exploit woman and girls and that is not right. But there are other religions that do that too.

I still adhere to almost all of those restraints except I don't adhere to any of the activitys put on by the church. I never had my name removed simply because I know it doesn't matter.

It was listed in the headlines this weekend as the only steady religion in size in the US and growing fast outside the US.  It's said that in the year 2060 there will be 280,000,000 Mormons in the world. <br>  <br>  14 million is a lot, 14 million is fast growth and the continuing trend is interesting.<br>  <br>  More people should read the book of Mormon for themselves and compare it to the bible on their own, otherwise they'll never know what's in it.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Gee.

That would cause a lot of people to have to change the way they look at life, a major paradigm shift.  That isn't easy.  It is always easier to stick to our comfortable ruts and carry on as we always have.<br>  Fourth, this work will continue to move forward.

37Tl4cvXaa	I support gay marriage 110%. Any two people who are in love should have the right to share that love for the rest of their lives, and show it to the world. ALL people should have equal rights no matter their gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. It's not a person's place to judge anyone, that's for God to do. If someone doesn't like gays having equal rights they should get over it, because it isn't hurting anyone.|`|GKgmyEfnaa	Marriage is between a man and a woman - that's what has always defined it.  There's no reason there can't be a gay equivalent and gay unions certainly have the same rights in many parts of the world.  People bleat about the gay 'right' to marriage, well how about the 'right' of hetero couples to have something that is theirs?  <br>  <br>  Dare I suggest that it really doesn't matter what arguments are given against gay marriage, there will always be a pack of homosexuals and their sympathisers who will be content to forever act the victim and claim discrimination no matter what happens.  <br>  <br>  All that being said, here are the three reasons:<br>  * The ancient definition of marriage is between a man and a woman.<br>  * The act of marriage is intended to form the basis of the family unit and natural homosexual parenthood is impossible.<br>  * Legal equality with hetero couples does not need to happen via marriage and social equality certainly won't!|`|FHtbvdvBaa	I believe that Same Sex marriages don't need the front part in front of them. I don't care about what anyone says about Marriage. My definition of a marriage is a union between two people who love each other and want to spend their whole life with each other. Not exactly stating it from my parents since my Dad is a player and my mum is far from the perfect mother.<br>  <br>  My logic is that even in a marriage ceremony the vows don't exactly say. "I am a man and you are a woman. Therefore we are allowed to get married", they say "I *insert name here* take you *insert name here* to be my lawfully wedded *watever* to have and to hold. To cherish and to *watever*, till death do us part". It doesn't state that you have to be Man and Woman.<br>  <br>  Therefore what is the point of being against it. If they are happy and love each other and they are willing to spend the rest of their lives together. Why stop them?|`|xN9dUBtAaa	I voted against it.  But I am totally against having it overturned.<br>  <br>  Fact 1.  We live in a Republic.  By definition the majority rules, unless the constitution or law is violated.<br>  <br>  Fact 2.  No rights are actually being denied.  Marrying the person you love is not, and never has been, a right.<br>  <br>  Fact 3.  The judges completely overstepped their bounds by unilaterally deciding to overturn Prop 22.  They fundamentally violated their mandate to uphold the will of the people.<br>  <br>  I am not swayed by the pure emotion of Prop 8.  I know that no rights have been violated, no one has been oppressed, I don't think all of our children will turn gay, I don't think churches will lose their tax exempt status, I don't believe any of the other BS that both sides threw out.  Both sides, for the most part, were full of sh*t.  I believe that people who want to get married should get married, and that is the extent of the proposition.<br>  <br>  But I believe 1000x stronger in the Republic.  I hated Bush but would never support kicking him out of office just because I don't like him.  If he violated the constitution, then absolutely - otherwise, mine is just an opinion and we cannot cannot cannot change the law or government just because someone doesn'tt like the result.  The Republicans tried that with Clinton and it was disastrous.<br>  <br>  So I don't like the result, but since the vote was within the law, the vote stands.  Period.  Maybe the court will find some right that was violated but I doubt it - unbiased legal scholars (those who aren't paid by the repeal movement) unanimously agree that the vote was fair - so the vote stands. Otherwise the whole meaning of law and voting because meaningless.<br>  <br>  If, however, it ever again comes to a vote and in the future the constitution is again amended allowing gays to marry, I will be just as pleased as anyone.|`|oY4vwdjVaa	The earth being the center of the universe used to be a fundamental concept and guess what - It isn't.

Because marriage is between a man and a woman.<br>  <br>  This is a basic fundamental concept.  You can call a rose a tulip all day long... it's still a rose.<br>  <br>  I DO however, believe that gays deserve to be able to get ALL of the rights of a "straight" marriage in their union to their partner.  It's just NOT a marriage.  It's a civil union, or a domestic partnership, or whatever "other" term it deserves.  <br>  <br>  Fundamental rights have NOT been infringed upon, because a gay CAN still go get married:  to a person of the opposite sex.|`|MhfneF0xaa	First of all, marriage is not a right, it is a privilege. And if you don't understand that, you need to do some serious studying.<br>  <br>  Secondly, marriage is a privilege defined by society, and society most definitely does not define marriage as anything other than a union between a man and a woman. Sorry, reality check here, what *you* want does not make it what society wants. And society, particularly in the 45 out of 50 states which have defined marriage as between a man and a woman, has *not* accepted marriage as anything else.<br>  <br>  Or is this no longer a democratic society? Does not the majority rule? Was not Prop 8 passed by *voters?*<br>  <br>  Or do the wishes of minorities overrule the democratic process?<br>  <br>  If so, who decides?|`|48cooyKRaa	Same sex marriage is an oxymoron.|`|bJiE54Qtaa	Most opponents of same-sex marriage base their reasoning and logic on scripture or how they were raised. Very many of them even oppose it because it scares the hell out of them. They might come from an upbringing that either condemned it or avoided the subject altogether.<br>  <br>  But somehow all of these people seem to forget one very simple fact: Marriage in the United States is nothing more than a legal contract. <br>  <br>  Granted, the union of a marriage specifically refers to a man and a woman in the most common scriptures, but the law doesn't recognize marriage as a religious union because of the separation of Church and State.<br>  <br>  If the law followed "tradition" (as so many opponents call it), Divorce would be out of the question. Considering that half of all marriages in the United States end with a Divorce, i'm willing to bet that even the most passionate opponents of same-sex marriage wont be picketing outside all of the Divorce Courts in the nation.<br>  <br>  If you were to remove the word "marriage" from every married couple, you'd see that they are just two consenting adults who fell in love, made a commitment to each other, and signed a paper to get legal recognition. That's it.<br>  <br>  Hell, I could care less if same-sex marriage was officially renamed "Civil Union" just as long as the legal benefits were exactly the same. There are thousands of same-sex couples in the United States that have already been legally proclaimed "married", and even more around the rest of the world. The existence of these couples doesn't obligate any person or Church to change their beliefs. <br>  <br>  As always, no Church in the U.S. is legally required to perform a ceremony for ANYONE (gay or not). Two Catholic people cannot march into a Baptist Church and demand a religious ceremony. The laws that protect a Church or person from having to personally compromise their own beliefs do not magically disappear or become irrelevant in the issue of same-sex marriage. <br>  <br>  If there's one thing any couple can count on, gay or straight, it is that they will be thrown to the curb if they enter a Church proclaiming their opposition of it. No Church will have open arms to a couple that openly opposes it...and they don't have the legal obligation to, either.<br>  <br>  There also isn't a breach of personal values for anyone when a gay couple ties the knot. If you have values that forbid approval of same-sex marriage then you've already made up your mind. Just because the government supports something from a legal standpoint doesn't require you to support it from an individual standpoint.<br>  <br>  There would be a vastly different issue at hand if the law prohibited any Church from denying a request for formal recognition. It would also be different if a person faced legal action for refusing to give their blessing to someone or something. Americans are fortunate enough to be legally protected from those that disagree with us.<br>  <br>  However, some folks get ahead of themselves and falsely assume that these laws were made just for them. In reality, the laws that protect our beliefs from outside opposition are also used to protect our individual liberties from opposing beliefs.<br>  <br>  The law ensures your right to have individual opinions and beliefs, while rendering “religion” as an option rather than a requirement. In addition, the law also ensures your right to pursue happiness without legal restrictions based on religion or personal stigma.<br>  <br>  Finally, there are disagreements concerning the public school system and adoption guidelines, both of which cite “children” as the priority.<br>  <br>  Too many parents are ignorant on this subject thanks to the misleading claims made by anti-gay activists. They have come to believe that by legally recognizing same-sex marriages, schools would be required to teach about homosexuality as if it were Math or Grammar. Actually, homosexuality (IF discussed) would be part of sex education (just like heterosexuality). Since sexuality isn’t considered a requirement on the schools part, parental consent is required. If a parent doesn’t want their child participating then the child doesn’t participate. Why would that ever change?<br>  <br>  The popular concerns of having homosexuality discussed in our schools aren’t necessarily unwarranted, though. I personally think the topic of sexuality should be left to the parents (and fortunately it can be if they choose). However, if parents disapprove the subject being added to sex education altogether then I believe they have a right to challenge it. After all, it is their tax dollars that fund these curriculums. <br>  <br>  With that said, though, the legal opposition should be directed towards the tax-funded schools rather than the individuals who ARE the subject. I doubt a gay couple across town had much to do with adding anything to the school’s curriculum. It’s a better idea to challenge the root of the problem rather than those who you personally think motivated it.<br>  <br>  As for adoption…it’s a stupid thing to even debate over. Throughout the countless studies and observations, a logical reason has yet to be discovered that would justify the denial of same-sex parents. While having one mother and one father is the most c

Were the pyramids built by visitors from another planet? It's not impossible! Inter-galactic visitations were not regulated and monitored back in those days like they are today. Any culture capable of space travel just jetted off to wherever they wanted,no questions asked.There are MANY stories in the older archives that tell of people from a "ga(galactically aware)" planet showing up on an "nga(non, etc.)"planet and throwing the entire population into chaos! In the days when the pyramids were built,there would have been nothing stopping any group of space travelers from dropping down on Earth,and doing it!

L. Ron Hubbard<br>  <br>  1. The student must confront the physical example of whatever they are being taught. (Otherwise the student and the teacher cannot agree on what is being communicated.)<br>  <br>  2. The learning must take place on an appropriate Gradient Scale of comprehension. That is, if a concept cannot be completely understood *in toto,* it must be broken down into steps, with the most ELEMENTARY steps preceding the INTERMEDIATE steps of the knowledge, followed by the most ADVANCED steps of the topic to be understood. These steps must be introduced in the proper order. No step must be rushed, omitted, nor repeated.<br>  <br>  3. Each and every technical term jargon must be thoroughly defined, using the relevant technical manuals and dictionaries.<br>  <br>  (WHENEVER ANYONE TELLS YOU that SCIENTOLOGY is "ALL RUBBISH," please be just enough to bring this up.) Most Christians DO NOT KNOW what it means when they are told to believe that "JESUS IS THE CHRIST." Before you have ANYTHING to actively do with Christianity, that is, to consider yourself a member, GOD MUST HAVE REVEALED TO YOU that "Jesus is The Christ." If a MAN revealed this to you, it means nothing. <br>  <br>  Many Christians will not understand that. In the foreign countries, it is a practice of strong arrogant *bullies* to force weak meek *nerds* to do their tough homework for them. There is a flaw in your educational system where somewhere down the line, someone decided that the students SHOULD NEVER BE TOLD *WHY* they go to school. WHY it matters that they should KNOW these things they are being "taught." If any one of the factors of learning is tampered with, it will be IMPOSSIBLE for the student to UNDERSTAND what they are being taught. A student in that position either learns to *cram,* and render what are- to them- meaningless strings of symbols in response to questions, or FLUNK their exams, or get sonmeone else to sit the exams FOR them. (This happens all the time in our country.)<br>  <br>  If you graduate from school, you should know that those who made other people do their homework for them NEVER MASTERED those topics, EVER. If such people as are able to brandish certificates they obtained without actually understanding what they were supposedly taught are allowed to take jobs in your country, the infrastructure is doomed.<br>  This is what has happened in our country (Nigeria).<br>  This is what has happened in the Christian Church.<br>  <br>     MATTHEW 22:16-22.<br>  <br>  16. And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, <br>  "Master, we know that thou art True, <br>  and teachest The Way of God in Truth,<br>  neither carest thou for any man:<br>  for thou regardest not the person of men.<br>  17. "Tell us therefore, <br>  'What thinkest thou? <br>  Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, <br>  or not?' "<br>  18. But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said,<br>  "Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?<br>  19. "Shew me the tribute money." <br>  And they brought unto him a penny.<br>  20. And he saith unto them, <br>  "Whose is this image and superscription?"<br>  21. They say unto him,<br>  "Caesar's."<br>  Then saith he unto them,<br>  "Render therefore unto Caesar <br>  the things which are Caesar's;<br>  and unto God the things that are God's."<br>  22. When they had heard these words, <br>  they marvelled, <br>  and left him, <br>  and went their way.<br>  <br>  THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT Christian Women should be allowed to speak in church or not was not brought up for righteous reasons.

So good Christian women need to be silent in church, if you want to follow the Bible<br>  .Here is a matter that I find interesting.  Christians seem to pick and choose what is convenient..|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	The Holy Catholic Church teaches, through Scripture and Tradition, that the husband is the head of his family and has God-given authority over his wife and children. This gift of authority does not give a husband any greater dignity than his wife.  Both are equal members of the marital covenant, as is reflected by God creating woman from the side of man (as opposed to his head or feet).  Instead, this order of authority reflects the divine order between God, Christ and man.  God blessed the marital covenant with this order to maintain peace and harmony in the family, the “domestic church.” Just as Christ is the Head of the Catholic Church (the family of God), so the father is the head of his domestic church (his family).<br>  <br>  Gen. 2:18; 1 Cor. 11:9; 1 Tim. 2:12-13 – while some people argue that God imposed the submission requirement upon women as a punishment for the original sin, this is not true. God designated the man as the head of his family from the very beginning of creation, even before the original sin.  Therefore, man’s authority over the woman was not imposed as a punishment for the original sin, but to reflect the order of creation.<br>  <br>  Gen. 3:16 – in fact, God revealed that women would want to usurp their husband’s authority as the result of the original sin. After the original sin, God tells Eve: “Yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.”  Thus, as a result of the original sin, Eve would desire to rule over Adam, but God ensured that Adam would rule over Eve. <br>  <br>  Just as wives must be submissive to their husbands as the head of the family, husbands must love their wives sacrificially, as Christ loves the Church:<br>  <br>  Eph. 5:25,28 – just as wives must submit to their husbands, husbands must “love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her…husbands should love their wives as their own bodies.” Just as the Church is legally and morally obligated to submit to Christ, wives are obligated to submit to their husbands. This is why Paul makes the comparison between husbands and Christ, wives and the Church.<br>  <br>  Eph. 5:33 – “let each one of you love his wife as himself.”<br>  <br>  Col.. 3:19 – “husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them.”<br>  <br>  1 Peter 3:7 – “Likewise you husbands, live considerately with your wives, bestowing honor on the woman as the weaker sex, since you are joint heirs of the grace of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered.”<br>  <br>  Because men are spiritual fathers to their families (as both ministerial and royal priests), God revealed through St. Paul that women should be silent in church, and not usurp the roles that God intended for men:<br>  <br>  1 Cor. 14:34-35 – “the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says.  If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.”<br>  <br>  1 Tim. 2:11-15 – “Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness. I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over men; she is to keep silent.  For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet woman will be saved through bearing children, if she continues in faith and love and holiness, with modesty.”  Paul is emphasizing the woman’s primary role as the giver of natural life, just as a man’s primary role is the giver of supernatural life.  Again, Paul bases his teaching on God’s order of creation.<br>  <br>  1 Cor. 14:34-35 – “the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says. If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.”  Notice that Paul says women should be silent in churches “as even the law says.”  In verse 37, he reiterates “what I am writing you is a command of the Lord.” Paul is explaining that forbidding women to speak in church is a divine command from Almighty God (and not sexist or culturally motivated).|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  I think that is one of the things from the Bible that was particular to the culture and society of that time.  It is not an eternal law.  It is likely that society at that time regarded outspoken women as rude and indecent.  Our society does not regard outspoken women as rude and indecent,  so it no longer makes sense to restrict women from speaking in church.<br>  <br>  Women are prohibited from becoming priests because at the mass the priest is acting in the role of Jesus Christ when plain bread and wine are consecrated into the body and blood of Jesus Christ.  It makes no sense whatever to have a woman in that role.  God came to Earth in the person of His son, Jesus.  This does not mean that women are inferior to men.   Anyone who thinks the Catholic Church looks down on women needs to study the Church's views on Mary, the Mother of Jesus.<br>  <br>  Women and men are very important to the continuing functioning of the Church,  and we each have our roles.  Today,  it is entirely acceptable for women to teach Catholic doctrine and to read from the Bible in Church.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|MdyHKQRGaa	Women are allowed to speak in churches today. <br>  Society is different than it was 2000 years ago.<br>  Which begs the question - why do we cling to other beliefs from 2000 years ago like condemning homosexuality?|`|DDFgKxcaaa	That's a metaphor. lol|`|jcZnIR1Zaa	During a Worship Service the women were asked to be silent.   They were further asked to ask questions of their own husbands.   <br>  <br>  In practice, in the first century churches, unmarried women were encouraged to ask questions of the local elders.   <br>  <br>  It is stated that the women should not take authority from the men in the church because Eve was deceived, and the decision-making authority was given to the men of the church.   <br>  <br>  Now, this has nothing to do with women and their part in society outside of the Worship Service and the internal functioning of the church.   Women back than ran their own businesses that were quite profitable.   Their households were huge, and included extended family members and their slaves, but permanent and bond slaves.   They were responsible for the welfare of everyone in the household.  <br>  <br>  Women were to be cherished for all these qualities, and in return, they were to offer respect to their husbands.    Equal but different.   <br>  <br>  God understands the differences between genders.   He ordains what is best for each.   In Leviticus and Deuteronomy, there are rules for behavior listed for the Hebrews to follow, and punishments listed for various moral sins.   A man and a woman who were willfully sinning by having relations outside of marriage were BOTH stoned to death, but in the case of the man forcing himself on a woman, only he was punished.   The major punishment was that he was considered married to the woman and was not allowed to abuse her, nor was he allowed to divorce her.   He had to take care of her and honor her for the rest of his natural life.    There was no pardon, there was no getting out of the fact that he was responsible for this lady forever.   Even if he died, she was taken care of out of his estate.    <br>  <br>  I understand that in today's society, this sounds undesireable, but back then, the woman now had the power,  She held that over the man's head as long as she lived.  All she had to do was complain to the Levites, or to her relatives, and the guy was toast.|`|g7bQ9zSvaa	People often take this verse out of context to try and claim that Paul or the bible is sexist.  The same Paul who wrote this letter to the church at Corinth also wrote about how he relied on many women in his ministry, he wrote of wise women from whom he learnt about the Gospel.  He also talks about deaconesses and prophetesses and other spiritual gifts in women. Obviously, if a woman is sharing a prophesy, she is not being silent.  Also, remember that the bible says that there is no man or woman, for all are equal in Christ. Therefore, it is clear that any interpretation that women are less important or not equally used by God in the church is of man, not God.  Putting that passage into context, Paul wrote to the church in Corinth, and that particular verse is within a section talking about keeping order in the church so that it's not a chaotic free-for-all mess.  Even if you quote just the entire sentence, never mind the whole paragraph, it becomes clear that Paul is saying that there is something different going on in the church at Corinth compared to the other "congregations of the saints".  Upon reading the chapter, it becomes clear that there was disorder in that church, and Paul was trying to direct their focus back to God.  And further reading of the bible reveals that women are permitted to teach - read Acts, and indeed Paul himself was taught by a woman.  You cannot teach though a silent mouth!  Clearly this passage is about women not shouting the odds, and don't forget the context.  At a time when most women were uneducated, the types of questions they would interrupt the service with could easily be answered by their more learned husbands at home (and in particular about the Scriptures, since previously it had only been the men who were properly trained in the scriptures).  Furthermore, the Greek word used for speak actually means babble, so they must have been interrupting the service with completely irrelevant or unsensible questions or comments.  That being said, he referred to all churches, meaning that this order should be kept in all churches, not just in Corinth.|`|PwD3slrTaa	Here's what that's about.<br>  <br>  Men would instruct other men, who knew about this stuff.  (Men are called to be the religious heads of their household, responsible for teaching about God continually, Deuteronomy 6:3-7)  But women who didn't know what they were talking about (being merely beginners on the subject) would constantly interrupt the meeting, asking "What's he talking about?  What's that mean?  Who's Elijah?  Where's Mount Horeb?  Transfiguration?  How in the world could a mustard seed grow into a tree?  Mene, mene, tekel, parsin- what's that?"<br>  <br>  This interruption was constant and very troublesome.  (Culturally, women did this a lot at the time.  Surprise, hahaha!)  But they should ask their husbands at home, as the next line says.<br>  <br>  This isn't relevant to most churches today, obviously, but I believe at the end of that book (or maybe it's Romans) Paul asks the recipients to greet a woman who is elsewhere identified as a deaconess.  So if you think God's against female leadership, you fail.|`|5CoJZut4aa	No way! Im a women training to be a minister and it never cease to amaze me how this comes up again and again. Context people! You cannot take a verse out of the bible without knowing the original authors and culture from which It was meant. That same passage also talks about men covering their heads in church. So unless you want to enforce that as well don't take verses out of the context for which they were written. Leviticus 13:47-59 tells you to destroy any clothes with mold on then . Are you prepared to do that?|`|AA11972123	Christians should be silent everywhere, regardless of gender LOL<br>  <br>  Just joking with you believers...you can thumb me down now :)  peace'n'love, sun x|`|0isZM7nSaa	Yes because they have issues with their relationship abroad and it's easier for it to mingle into the woman preaching.|`|KOecCLjLaa	in church out of church, its all the same, they should be quiet, and I'm athiest|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	depends on the type of service.

Or one of the other thousands of religions out there?  What if the "correct" religion hasn't been realized yet?<br>  <br>  2) Even if there IS a right religion, and it IS Christianity, how exactly is the correct way to go about it?  There are literally hundreds of different sects of Christianity: you have the Catholics, Presbyterians, Lutherans, Seventh Day Adventists, Mormons, Methodists, Episcopalians, Baptists, Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Jehovah's Witnesses, Pentecostals, Calvinists, Anglicans...some of which are convinced that all other sects but themselves are going to hell.<br>  <br>  3) If the existence of God is at least debatable, then why should "If he exists, then he wants you to follow a particular religion or he'll punish you" be any less debatable?<br>  <br>  4) Assuming God exists and your religion is all true, don't you think God would be smart enough to know about people who were following the religion "just in case'?

What if another religion claimed an even worse afterlife if you didn't follow that religion, and an even better afterlife if you did? Would you then change religions?<br>  <br>  That's an awful lot like the Santa Clause story where you're promised coal if you're bad (disobedient), and nice gifts if you're good (obedient), at the end of the year. And he knows when you're sleeping, and knows when you're awake, know if you've been good or bad, so be good just in case it's true.<br>  <br>  But in this life, one must weigh out whether following a particular ideology which goes against one's personal values is really worth the chance that there will be a stocking full of good gifts after death.<br>  <br>  So what about other religions which say there is punishment after life for those who don't follow, and reward for those who do, but don't follow Jesus?<br>  <br>  Belief is not something you choose, it's something you realize you have. Could you really practice a religion even if you don't believe? Could you worship a God of cruelty who would allow people to burn in unimaginable torment for all eternity even though they've only lived for less than 100 years?<br>  <br>  I can't.

ingmriygaa	This covers the third, fourth and fifth mandalas of the sacred text and is generally dedicated to Agni - the sacred fire. This volume also inclThe Rigveda (Sanskrit: ?????? ?gvedá, a compound of ?c "praise, verse"[1] and veda "knowledge") is an ancient Indian sacred collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns. It is counted among the four canonical sacred texts (?ruti) of Hinduism known as the Vedas.[2] Some of its verses are still recited as Hindu prayers, at religious functions and other occasions, putting these among the world's oldest religious texts in continued use. [3]<br>  <br>  It is one of the oldest extant texts of any Indo-European language. Philological and linguistic evidence indicate that the Rigveda was composed in the north-western region of the Indian subcontinent, roughly between 1700–1100 BC[4] (the early Vedic period). There are strong linguistic and cultural similarities with the early Iranian Avesta, deriving from the Proto-Indo-Iranian times, often associated with the early Andronovo (Sintashta-Petrovka) culture of ca. 2200-1600 BC<br>  udes the sacred "Gayatri Mantra"The Rigvedic hymns are dedicated to various deities, chief of whom are Indra, a heroic god praised for having slain his enemy Vrtra; Agni, the sacrificial fire; and Soma, the sacred potion or the plant it is made from. Equally prominent gods are the Adityas or Asura gods Mitra-Varuna and Ushas (the dawn). Also invoked are Savitr, Vishnu, Rudra, Pushan, Brihaspati or Brahmanaspati, as well as deified natural phenomena such as Dyaus Pita (the shining sky, Father Heaven ), Prithivi (the earth, Mother Earth), Surya (the sun god), Vayu or Vata (the wind), Apas (the waters), Parjanya (the thunder and rain), Vac (the word), many rivers (notably the Sapta Sindhu, and the Sarasvati River). The Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Sadhyas, Ashvins, Maruts, Rbhus, and the Vishvadevas ("all-gods") as well as the "thirty-three gods" are the groups of deities mentioned.<br>  <br>  The hymns mention various further minor gods, persons, concepts, phenomena and items, and contain fragmentary references to possible historical events, notably the struggle between the early Vedic people (known as Vedic Aryans, a subgroup of the Indo-Aryans) and their enemies, the Dasa or Dasyu and their mythical prototypes, the Pa?i (the Bactrian Parna).<br>  <br>   <br>  Rigveda (padapatha) manuscript in Devanagari, early 19th century. After a scribal benediction ("?rīga?é?āyanama? ;; Aum(3) ;;"), the first line has the opening words of RV.1.1.1 (agni? ; i?e ; pura?-hita? ; yaj?asya ; deva? ; ?tvija?). The Vedic accent is marked by underscores and vertical overscores in red.Mandala 1 comprises 191 hymns. Hymn 1.1 is addressed to Agni, and his name is the first word of the Rigveda. The remaining hymns are mainly addressed to Agni and Indra, as well as Varuna, Mitra, the Ashvins, the Maruts, Usas, Surya, Rbhus, Rudra, Vayu, Brhaspati, Visnu, Heaven and Earth, and all the Gods. <br>  Mandala 2 comprises 43 hymns, mainly to Agni and Indra. It is chiefly attributed to the Rishi g?tsamada ?aunahotra. <br>  Mandala 3 comprises 62 hymns, mainly to Agni and Indra and the Vishvedevas. The verse 3.62.10 has great importance in Hinduism as the Gayatri Mantra. Most hymns in this book are attributed to vi?vāmitra gāthina?. <br>  Mandala 4 comprises 58 hymns, mainly to Agni and Indra as well as the Rbhus, Ashvins, Brhaspati, Vayu, Usas, etc. Most hymns in this book are attributed to vāmadeva gautama. <br>  Mandala 5 comprises 87 hymns, mainly to Agni and Indra, the Visvedevas ("all the gods'), the Maruts, the twin-deity Mitra-Varuna and the Asvins. Two hymns each are dedicated to Ushas (the dawn) and to Savitr. Most hymns in this book are attributed to the atri clan. <br>  Mandala 6 comprises 75 hymns, mainly to Agni and Indra, all the gods, Pusan, Ashvin, Usas, etc. Most hymns in this book are attributed to the bārhaspatya family of Angirasas. <br>  Mandala 7 comprises 104 hymns, to Agni, Indra, the Visvadevas, the Maruts, Mitra-Varuna, the Asvins, Ushas, Indra-Varuna, Varuna, Vayu (the wind), two each to Sarasvati (ancient river/goddess of learning) and Vishnu, and to others. Most hymns in this book are attributed to vasi??ha maitravaru?i. <br>  Mandala 8 comprises 103 hymns to various gods. Hymns 8.49 to 8.59 are the apocryphal vālakhilya. Hymns 1-48 and 60-66 are attributed to the kā?va clan, the rest to other (Angirasa) poets. <br>  Mandala 9 comprises 114 hymns, entirely devoted to Soma Pavamana, the cleansing of the sacred potion of the Vedic religion. <br>  Mandala 10 comprises additional 191 hymns, frequently in later language, addressed to Agni, Indra and various other deities. It contains the Nadistuti sukta which is in praise of rivers and is important for the reconstruction of the geography of the Vedic civilization and the Purusha sukta which has great significance in Hindu social tradition. It also contains the Nasadiya sukta (10.129), probably the most celebrated hymn in the west, which deals with creation. The marriage hymns (10.85) and the death hymns (10.10-18) still are of great importance in the performance of the corresponding Grhya rituals. <br>  <br>  Dating and historical context<br>   <br>  Geography of the Rigveda, with river names; the extent of the Swat and Cemetery H cultures are also indicated.The dating of Rigveda has been a center of controversies; there is a strong disagreement amongs scholars. The Rigveda is far more archaic than any other Indo-Aryan text. For this reason, it was in the center of attention of western scholarship from the times of Max Müller and Rudolf Roth onwards. The Rigveda records an early stage of Vedic religion. There are strong linguistic and cultural similarities with the early Iranian Avesta,[17] deriving from the Proto-Indo-Iranian times,[18][19] often associated with the early Andronovo culture of ca. 2000 BC.[20] The Rigveda's core is accepted to date to the late Bronze Age, making it one of the few examples with an unbroken tradition. Its composition is usually dated to roughly between 1700–1100 BC.[21]. The EIEC (s.v. Indo-Iranian languages, p. 306) gives 1500–1000. It is certain that the hymns post-date Indo-Iranian separation of ca. 2000 BC and probably that of the Indo-Aryan Mitanni documents of c. 1400 BC.[22] Several other evidences also pointed out 1400 BC as the most reasonable date[23][24].<br>  <br>  Philological estimates tend to date the bulk of the text to the second half of the second millennium. Compare Max Müller's statement "the hymns of the Rig-Veda are said to date from 1500 BC" ('Veda and Vedanta', 7th lecture in India: What Can It Teach Us: A Course of Lectures Delivered Before the University of Cambridge, World Treasures of the Library of Congress Beginnings by Irene U. Chambers, Michael S. Roth. some writers out of the mainstream claim to trace astronomical references in the Rigveda, dating it to as early as 4000 BC, a date corresponding to the Neolithic late Mehrgarh culture; summarized by Klaus Klostermaier in a 1998 presentation. The text in the following centuries underwent pronunciation revisions and standardization (samhitapatha, padapatha). This redaction would have been completed around the 6th century BC.[25] Exact dates are not established, but they fall within the pre-Buddhist period (500, or rather 400 BC).<br>  <br>  Writing appears in India around the 3rd century BC in the form of the Brahmi script, but texts of the length of the Rigveda were likely not written down until much later, the oldest surviving manuscript dating to the 11th century[citation needed], while some Rigveda commentaries may date from the second half of the first millennium CE. While written manuscripts were used for teaching in medieval times, they were written on birch bark or palm leaves, which decompose fairly quickly in the tropical climate, until the advent of the printing press from the 16th century. The hymns were thus preserved by oral tradition for up to a millennium from the time of their composition until the redaction of the Rigveda, and the entire Rigveda was preserved in shakhas for another 2,500 years from the time of its redaction until the editio princeps by Rosen, Aufrecht and Max Müller.<br>  <br>  After their composition, the texts were preserved and codified by an extensive body of Vedic priesthood as the central philosophy of the Iron Age Vedic civilization. The Brahma Purana and the Vayu Purana name one Vidagdha as the author of the Padapatha.[26] The Rk-pratishakhya names Sthavira Shakalya of the Aitareya Aranyaka as its author.[27]<br>  <br>  The Rigveda describes a mobile, semi-nomadic culture, with horse-drawn chariots, oxen-drawn wagons, and metal (bronze) weapons. The geography described is consistent with that of the Greater Punjab: Rivers flow north to south, the mountains are relatively remote but still visible and reachable (Soma is a plant found in the high mountains, and it has to be purchased from tribal people). Nevertheless, the hymns were certainly composed over a long period, with the oldest (not preserved) elements possibly reaching back to times close to the split of Proto-Indo-Iranian (around 2000 BC)[28] Thus there was some debate over whether the boasts of the destruction of stone forts by the Vedic Aryans and particularly by Indra refer to cities of the Indus Valley civilization or whether they rather hark back to clashes between the early Indo-Aryans with the BMAC in what is now northern Afghanistan and southern Turkmenistan (separated from the upper Indus by the Hindu Kush mountain range, and some 400 km distant). While it is highly likely that the bulk of the Rigvedic hymns were composed in the Punjab, even if based on earlier poetic traditions, there is no mention of either tigers or rice[29] in the Rigveda (as opposed to the later Vedas), suggesting that Vedic culture only penetrated into the plains of India after its|`|jTFHNLS7aa	Oh! is there a main god and sub gods?|`|AKDfOoxCaa	The Hindu vedas explain God and His great empire of celestial gods in great detail. Yet they declare that the Truth (Almighty God) is one, though called variously by the wise (read: various Faiths - there are as many versions of Godhood in HIndu scriptures as there are Faiths now).. Cf: Ekam sath vipraa bahudaa vadanti (Rig veda 16-46).<br>  <br>  Initially they explain the lesser gods who serve the domain of the Invisible One (Brahman) like the Fire, Indra (ruler of nature's forces like Fire, Wind, Rain etc.. - like a king under an emperor..)<br>  <br>  In the final analysis, the vedas reveal the all pervasiveness and all powerfulness of the almighty God.. Most of the western religious followers quote these verses to pull down the Hindus about their worship of idols and nature.. as God..!!<br>  <br>  Just like Nishad above. I gave him a thumbs up for his great pain to quote the vedic scriptures vis a vis the holy Quoran to uphold the Nirguna (formless) God and even passages denouncing the worship of nature.. <br>  <br>  Hindus do not worship the nature as God but God as the nature.. in the spirit that all are pervaded by His loving presence.. The idol is not worshipped as stone or metal but the Spirit is visualised in the statue - just as we salute a national flag as representing the nation itself..<br>  <br>  And this idolatory is not against the "spirit" of vedas which do talk of the "Purusha with a thousand eyes and thousant feet.." (Purusha suktham - Thaithreeya Upanishad, Yajur veda) albeit in figurative sense.. (like the saluting of a national flag..)<br>  <br>  The govt seal and emblems have some validity and authority in common practice.. even as the symbols of religions (cross or crescent or chakra or linga..) do.<br>  <br>  I shall not go into further details for the simple reason that the posers of the question are not seeking to be clarified but to pick holes... which you can always do in the best of contents.. Anyone can find the excellent questions of doubt in any atheist literature about any religion.. But the excellence of human wisdom is a mirage against the glaring Truth of religious scriptures..<br>  <br>  You can not cite the Vedas of Hindus in bits and arrive at conclusions, particularly being used to following a different Faith.. There are Hindu scholars who read more valuable meanings in other holy books (e.g., Holy Science - a Spiritual Interpretation of Bible, by Swamy Yuktheswar Giri, Self Realization Fellowship, Los Angeles). If we have respect of religious Faiths in general we can always find the gems of wisdom.. if we are sceptic, we can find only conflicts and confusion..<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|xF8TvlhYaa	Mr.Bala! Nishad has not taken any extra pain to do any research to compare Vedas with the Holy Quoran. He has made cut copy paste from www.irf.net of Dr. Zakir Naik.Dr. Zakir Naik's intension of comparing religions is to put Islam on a higher pedestal and show other religions as incomplete.For example he takes an analogy of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa which was meant to promote religious harmony.<br>  <br>  Sri Ramakrishna says:''A Muslim climbs down a pond from one side takes a handful of water and call it 'pani';a Hindu climbs down from another side and takes water from the same pond and calls it 'jal';similarly a Christian calls it 'water';a scientist calls it 'aqua'. Though they call the same water by different names,it is one and the same. So with God. Different religions call the same God by different names.<br>  <br>  Dr. Zakir Naik says:"But water and urine are not same though they may look like the same.That means Islam is pure water and all religions are like urine, contaminated.<br>  <br>  Dr. Zakir Naik is proud of his country India, not because of its rich heritage,not because of its attaining independence mostly by non violence,not because its green revolution, not because of its unity in diversity,not because of its generally peaceful nature of common people, not because 3 past presidents of India were Muslims,not becuase Indian government gives subsidy to Haj pilgrims, not because<br>  a woman was prime minister and now a woman is the president,not because there is no big reaction from the majority community after 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attack.......<br>  Dr, Zakir Naik is proud of India because India gives freedom to preach <br>  religion!!

Whereas mk2008's literally translated is, "As for me, things like football and netball, also sometimes soccer and going for strolls is what I like to do."  The order is more natural for native Japanese, but since I'm a native English speaker, I tend to translate more directly.  <br>  <br>  Using "ya" instead of "to" to connect the different activities also indicates that you like to do things like those activities, not just the ones listed.

To believe more people have just become ''demoralizing'' for the sake of that makes no sense. You'll always hear thing, especially from older people about how things were ''better'' a while ago. Yeah, but was it better for pedophile priests to get away with their dirty secrets? You'll hear someone else say how it's so ''dangerous'' today? That depends on where you live though. If someone who lives in New York City, and actually weren't an idiot, they'd know how safe that city is.
