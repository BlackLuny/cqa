20090128220558AA8Z0jp	Travel;United States;San Francisco	Good things to do/areas to stay near SF w/ a baby?	My husband and 1 year old son are going to San Francisco for about 10 days in April. We will be spending the first few days in the city itself since my husband will be there for a conference but after that, we wanted to spend 3 or 4 days in wine country or something nice like that. I'm a big wine fan but also love the outdoors. We like going out on the town but figure we will get enough of that in SF since we have friends there who will take us out.  I was thinking maybe Sonoma would be more laid back than Napa so was leaning that way. I'm looking for decent, not overly pricy hotels, good restaurants, and fun activities. We also want it to be baby friendly, or at least baby tolerant. My son is really good and has an agreeable personality so he should be ok. We take him out to restaurants all the time and he is very well behaved. Any suggestions?

I am in my early 30's and still enjoy partying but want to live in a place where people are down to earth.      I have narrowed my choices down to Culver City, Hollywood, Marina Del Rey, Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, and Redondo Beach.       Basically, I like the beach side atmosphere, but want to know where the people are down to earth. Manhattan Beachnseems a little too upscale and Hermosa seems fun to party but the people seem a little into image. I will be coming from the Bay Area and find it too quiet over here. But the people seem a little more grounded.
