20090225025504AAfYWkP	Games & Recreation;Other - Games & Recreation	Where can i get free fun quiz from the website? Is there any games that recommend for yr6-12 school girls.?	I am the Red Cross Captain for our school this year. Is there any games/activities that recommend for yr 6-12 school girls during lunch time (40 mins). We have about 30-45 people in the group across the yr level. Is there any game that will fit all the girls? Preferably have sort of a subject that related to Red Cross (eg LOVE, ACCPECT OTHERS...etc). we can do the activities where we have to walk around or drawing something, but not "run around" nor "forming circles".       Also, where can i get free fun quiz from the website?    Like the ones that you did it yr8 or yr9, which has the questions like "how many keys on a piano?" or "how many people in NRL?".       The other ones which might also work is like " 7 D in a W" where you have to wrote "7days in a week".       I've always been wondering where the teachers get the quizzes from. So, if anyone and paste some website that have stuff like that it will be good.    I need the website that can self-generate the question, so i don't have to make up the questions.       thx.

He told me he might be getting a Nintendo DS soon, and I asked him what games he might buy. He said he was going to buy "Nintendo Pups"....WTF....   I've heard of Nintendogs, and I even asked him if he meant Nintendogs,   but he said the game was called Nintendo Pups...
