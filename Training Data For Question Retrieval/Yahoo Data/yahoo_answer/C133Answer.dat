7iMZ91K7aa	THANK YOU!!! I've seen both of those videos, and I love the Moms reaction... but that little boy and his Dad, get me every single time I watch it... my co-workers all probably think I'm a big nut because I am watching these video's crying! lol Thanks so much for sharing!!    I cant wait until I am able to tell my in-laws and my own Mom... they are going to FREAK OUT!!!! haha hopefully I can get my BFP real soon!!!!|`|tmCA6jdSaa	omg!! i loved them both im still crying after the 2nd one lol too cute|`|uuKTQ84Qaa	That second one is so sad ! But yet happy I almost cried! Thanks I needed that !|`|x52tr87Yaa	Whewww that one will get you all emotional! Such amazing love kids have for their parents!|`|PFjUjbOdaa	AWWWWWWWWWW!!!      You will most definitely need a tissue box for the second! The first one was priceless! Loved them!|`|s3OkLl8zaa	The 1st made me laugh how funny is her mum hehehe, The 2nd one brought tears to my eyes bless him ahhhh that was well cute x|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	1st- i wish my mum did that when she found out i was pregnant (i was 16)  2nd- wow i cryed,and i never cry!|`|FLOjzbKEaa	cute videos|`|AA11927140	Wow.  Thanks.  Like the others have said, I totally laughed at the first one, and then cried uncontrollably with the second.  The look on his little face... oh my gosh.  That was amazing.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Wow, talk about change in emotions in each video.  The one with the Mom made me laugh hysterically.  That was SO cute!!!!  I loved how she grabbed her daughter and started dancing!!    Then the one with the Daddy and son made me cry.  Gosh, that's so hard on kids, but there is something about that son and father relationship.  Especially when they are close.  Thanks for the two videos!  =)|`|XO4talxxaa	These are the sweetest videos ever! The first got me a little misty eyed but the second video i had tears! I am sitting at my desk at work lol Cute videos though! :)
rZXQvA75aa	I would not consider this as your period as Brown blood is old blood. I would wait a couple more days and unless you have some actual bleeding I would take another test.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	No, I wouldn't consider that a period yet dear.  =)  I'd say that's probably implantation bleeding.|`|nqR7CQ4gaa	hmmmm...i wouldnt think so. maybe take a hpt. good luck!|`|sEr58mAVaa	Probably. Yes you should.
vUr2GX4iaa	Don't stress and have fun!  I never charted temps or kept track of ovulation due to me being quite irregular (I only get my periods twice a year).  For this reason, I took Vitex for 2 months and by the grace of God I got pregnant after the second month of trying.  I think not stressing and just going with the flow helped.  Good luck!|`|gklH61Uiaa	Put his penis in your vagina and then have him thrust in and out untill he ejaculates.  Repeat.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Track your ovulation and have sex on those days.

Have sex.   (2). If you are sterile go to sperm bank (awesome b/c you may get to sue them and make them pay child support)!  (3). Make sure your wife/partner is not having a fake orgasm!  This is actually important because it is a method of natural selection.  (4). The guy should not wear tight things as when your "berries" are close to your body they may get hot enough to lower sperm production.  (5).  Pray to your fertility God!  I know a few of them.|`|iNBLWIFKaa	I have heard that eating yams is rumored to cause twins. I don't know if it works. I have twins but didn't eat yams.

r7q8LW7Aaa	My parents were in the 'older' category when they had my younger sisters. My dad is now well into his fifties and cares for my young teenage sisters.   He's a fantastic dad and even they admit it. His age means he is more patient with them.  You already know the genetic risks, but if you feel up for it, go for it. You don't want to look back and wonder why you didn't.  For me, life is about family, the more the merrier.|`|2ZoUduoPaa	I say go for it!!!  If you are healthy, and your family supports the idea, then get to baby making!!!!  Age is just a number.  My preacher's wife just turned 40 and just had baby number 4!!   I look for them to have another in the near future!!!  She loves children and loves being pregnant!!!  I think it's wonderful!!!!    Good luck to you1!!!|`|RNNdRHrMaa	Good for you, if you know you can look after this child (health not being a factor etc), and give it as much love and affection as you did with your older two children, why the hell not?!    I am much younger than my partner (He is 40 and I am 24), our daughter will be 3 in April. His eldest son was 18 in November, his daughters are 16 and 14. He was adament he wouldn't have anymore children after them, but things happen, and I despite all medical belief, caught.    Our daughter is well adjusted and confident, she has benefitted from having an older sibling in the house, as she is learning (very quickly) that he needs his privacy etc.  It's also very handy if you get caught short for a babysitter, although I wouldn't  rely on them to do it constantly as that would be unfair on them, as they have their own lives.    Fingers crossed for you, good luck and hope everything goes well.|`|CJp2iKpcaa	Having a baby at this age can sometimes be dangerous. You need to consult with your doctor ahead of time and see what he/she says about it. They will tell you if you're physically healthy enough to carry and conceive the baby.|`|F6jUJUoOaa	well at 41, ur mature adult with a more stable life, plus you've got experience on how to change nappies, and just generally on babies from your two kids. and also u would hav ur hubby and your eldest child to help you out, maybe your 19 year old could even babysit for you when u and hubby wont to go out, thats definitely a plus point.  So yep if you wana have another kid just go for it - so what you waitin for aint you got a baby to be makin lol  goodluck hun x|`|1bHaB8xvaa	My mum had me at 33, my sister at 36, and my brother at 45. I think it's fine.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	I think it's selfish. My dad was older when my sister was born and in her early 20's she was put in the position to be dealing with her parents serious health issues. Not something she should have been dealing with. When your child turns 10 you will be 52. Doesn't that just sound sad when the other parents are 35 or 40? You might consider yourself young but you can't fight your true age and the problems that come along with it. Their children wouldn't even know who you were or have you in their life. Something to think about. Not to mention that down syndrome and other birth defects are a realization for women that age.|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	i think its wrong.  sorry!!  but you dont have as much energy and that will effect the baby and when its 10 and wanting to runn around and your 50!come on!  plus not to put a downer on things but its very possible that you could die from old age alone when the "baby" is only 20! that really not fair.  i have a friend with older parents and he gets so sad becoz people think his dad is his grandad,he hates it too.  sorry xx|`|JmM8xCbLaa	I don't see a problem with it. If you and your family are happy with it then that's all that matters! I am 18 and I have a 11 week old baby girl and I couldn't be happier... my boyfriend is a fair bit older than me, he goes to work, pays the mortgage/bills etc, and I stay home to look after my baby, and I do my best! There are no age restrictions as to when you can or cannot become a parent... if that was the case then we wouldn't be able to get pregnant until that 'right' time.  My mum had me when she was 30, and my youngest brother when she was 39 and we are both fine. The only thing I'd say is there is a 10 year age gap between my eldest and youngest brother... but if your kids are fine with it then there's no problem. Good Luck and Best Wishes!|`|LeY6hx4Laa	its your life and you only have one one them, i had my son at 18 and people say im too young, too young too old does it really matter as long as you can support, love and care for them, live your life too the full and be happy x|`|AA11315360	41 isnt that old. You are married so just have the baby. You dont want to have an abortion if you are married and can afford the baby. And you wouldnt want to give it up for adoption because why keep the 2 other kids and not this one. That child would never forgive you if you give it up for adoption.  You will not be judged at having a child at 41. There is nothing wrong with that. You will be an even better mom now because you already had 2 kids. And they can help you babysit. Now you have 3 people to help you with this baby (the other kids and your husband).|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I feel its very much an individual decision based upon your situation.  For me, no my situation I am a few years younger than you and would not ttc.  I have got health issues pcos, am overweight, have infertility.  Nobody in my family had a child after 33 and that was me.  My mom last at age 30, my mom's mom last/only at 28, her mom 26, my dad's mom was 26 with her last/only, her mom 24, dad's dad's mom 21 with last/only.  So fertility does run in families.  My husband's family one aunt was 37,39, and 41, one aunt was 38, his mom was 36, another aunt 40|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Well, you have a significantly increased risk of having a baby with Down's syndrome. That may or may not be an issue for you - but you should be aware of it.|`|tc8nbxmyaa	you would consider a strangers opinion on such a personal topic?|`|wiAVa1H5aa	What about it?   It brings more risk, both in terms of having a child with a trisomy disorder and with you having a difficult pregnancy, but all three of my great-grandmothers (one died soon after childbirth) and both of my grandmothers had children in their mid to late 40s, so it's not a new thing.  If you are healthy and want another child, I hope your fertility is good and you are able to get pregnant again.|`|AA11764194	Coming March I will be 41 and I am TTC for my second baby.. as long as this is what you want and your family is ok.. go ahead..    Good luck and baby dust..|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It seems like most of the negative comments are from people who have never had a baby in their 40s or don't have older siblings with a big age gap.     This is a personal matter and really, you can't offer much perspective if you haven't been there, done that.     My dad was 46 when he had my youngest brother. I think for a lot of people, as long as you're in good health, age is nothing but a number. Sure, you have a higher risk of birth defects, but really - so does any woman of child bearing age, whether they're 24 or 44. A perfectly healthy YOUNG woman stands a chance of having a baby with Down's, too. And there are lots of 40-something women running around with kids that are perfectly fine and healthy! Why focus only on the negative?     Big age gaps can be good and they can be bad. I think it all depends on what you make of it. I have much older stepsiblings that I didn't really grow up with that I'm closer to than the one stepsibling I *did* grow up with, if that makes sense. I'm 34 and my one older stepsister is 49, and we get along great. She loves my kids and we get along great. I do have half brothers 8 and 12 years younger than me, and while I do consider them my biological siblings, we weren't raised full-time in the same household, which I think makes a world of difference.     If you include them in this potential new baby's life and upbringing, you might be surprised at how well it turns out. If they're happy being the only two, well, that's great, but it's not really their decision.    ETA: I just realized that with your two other kids, there's already a big age gap between kids. So you're living it already, in a sense.    My God, people - this lady is 41, not 81!! She could be around for another 50 years to 'see how her children's lives turn out.' Good grief.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	My sister had her first when she was 40 then had 2 more by the time she was 45.|`|nrQijvMuaa	I'm not an older parent but I feel that at your age why not if god has blessed yo to bear children then why not. If your in great health and you & your better half agree then I would say GO 4 It!! Good Luck!!|`|wy7YkwIEaa	my step mum had my little brother when she was 44 - he was her last out of 7!! he is now 9 and I am so glad he is here as he is such a cheeky little so and so :) my auntie also had a son when she was 42 and she had two kids in their twenties at the time, hes now 11.     i think its really lucky to have kids that are really happy about it as they can help out with babysitting duties :) i still do for my brother when i can.    congratulations and good luck for the future x|`|zH7KZJEZaa	I think its a great idea, youre never too old to have children, women are meant to be able to reproduce until menopause so there is no right or wrong.    Good luck with whatever desicion you make!|`|lFqUMMAGaa	If you and your family are happy about your pregnancy that's all that counts ~|`|YAWkCPqYaa	Sorry , but i could think of nothing worse than to bring a baby into this crazy world , that's just my opinion , but if your happy with it then go ahead|`|zPGcIbPSaa	The only think i would think about if i were you is aren't you going to wish you were around longer to see how their lives turn out? Not in a bad way.    My parents are older and they are gradually loosing interest to the things that really matter to a teen. Whta im saying is that they don't understand me or any of my friends anymore. They forget what its like and how hard it is.|`|hqogf9oGaa	Hey congratulations!    I think a little surprise like this is fantastic.  You have already raised 2 children and the fact you are a little older means you have more life experience and also more experience as a Mum.    There will be people who criticise - there are those who think a certain age is too young and that a certain age is too old but in all honestly if you can cope - which I am sure you can, that's all that matters.  Why worry what other people think - people criticise others in order to make themselves feel better about things they are unhappy with in their own lives so the criticism is actually more of a reflection of them than an educated, informed opinion of you.  You clearly have the support of your husband and your children which is great.    I am the middle child.  I am 28, my older sister is 36 and my younger sister is 17.  My Mum had my little sister when I was 11 and the bond we have is brilliant - as is the bond between my older and younger sister.  In my experience we, as siblings are much closer despite the age gap as there are "maternal" type instincts there - by that I mean that we feel a sense of resposibility and wanting to take extra good care of one another.  There certainly was no sibling rivalry when we growing up nor jealousy as we each had years with our Mum and the age gap between us meant there was physical fighting which sometimes happens with siblings who are close in age.    You are in almost exactly the same situation as my Mum was albeit she was 38 when she had my younger sister.  She has said that the pregnancy itself was more tiring and raising my little sister was more tiring and sometimes it was difficult for her to deal with a homonal daughter whilst going through the menopause but she survived...and she maintains that she would not change a single thing.    And, on the plus side you will always have a babysitter....hee hee!    Wishing you the best of luck!    Indigo    xxx|`|jvLNWFPjaa	absolutely fine|`|Nd6uItCDaa	Sure, just make sure you can support the child through-out his/her life.|`|ab682b6840784d29891281987e3e32b2aa	A) that is a long span of time between siblings. It's hard to relate to a sibling when they are that far apart.     B) you already have 2 anyways and we're becoming overpopulated...stick with the 2    C) you're at more of a risk for something going wrong in your pregnancy being a bit older...I wouldn't risk it.|`|KcHSMb0Iaa	if you are healthy enough, id say go for it!!! its nice to see someone stable asking about getting pregnant. im sick of 14 year olds asking about being pregnant! good luck!!!|`|nDAnSuVBaa	To me there is nothing wrong with that, you're still young.  If 51 then maybe not lol.  But if you're happy with it and the situation's right, then do it while you still have the chance :)    Oooh and my mum had me when she was 40.  I'm 16 now and we get on great, and being brought up around slightly mature people has made me more grown up in myself, like my bro n sis are 13-15 years older.    Good luck x
CRVi3YsOaa	do the BD before on and after ovulation. If you do it just on the 4th you have some chance but if you do it multiple times, then you can make sure that his little guys are there to meet your egg, and you would have a better chance.

rZXQvA75aa	I doubt that you are pregnant, probably just late unfortunately. It was way too early for the symptoms you were experiencing. You would be more likely to experience period like cramps. I've gone through it also where you convince yourself that you could be pregnant and then all the symptoms come. I would wait a couple more days and take another test to be sure but I am pretty positive that it was just a later period. Good luck to you while TTC and I hope you get your BFP soon!|`|nqR7CQ4gaa	Sounds like maybe you could be. Take a hpt. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|SzNmGV0Daa	Hmp, either you are pregnant or were pregnant.

5axGfFofaa	I used it and got pregnant the first month using it.  I unfortunately had m/c.  But, it did it's job.  So, I used it again this month to see if I was ovulating after m/c and fortunately I did.  I am going to start trying again in March so hopefully it will do its magic again.If you can afford it, buy it.  You could get a used one off ebay and it would be fine.  It is very helpful to have all the info that it provides you with.  Worth every penny!|`|aXALjavKaa	Every Time I Have Used Clearblue The Results Are Negative. So I Stopped Using Them.. There Like Bad Luck 2 Mi Or Something.. I Would Prefur First Responce. :) Take Care Sweetie.|`|gjJcAN1Uaa	I've read some positive things about them, lots of people get pregnant after using them. I finally tried it after TTC for about 10 months last September. I used it for 3 cycles. Still not pregnant so I gave up using the thing. I did get usually 2 days of high fertility and 1 day of peak, then it'd go back down 1 day of high, then it'd go down to low for rest of cycle. I'm pretty sure it works. I had a fertility doctor go through a battery of tests with me so I know I do ovulate around day 14.   Just all these tests and kits and charting, I got tired of it. So we need to just try some good ole fashioned luck. Anything is worth a shot in my book, so it doesn't hurt to try it out. It's more accurate then the standard OPK's from my perspective.  Good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|H74F8jxuaa	I bought it last month and it was my first cycle to use it.  I am patiently waiting until af comes or I get my bfp.  It gave me two peak days my first month, so I know that it works.  As far as getting pregnant, I am not sure yet because I only used it one cycle.  I bought a brand new one off ebay for 139.99 with 30 test sticks.  You can find good deals there.  It works for me.
iNBLWIFKaa	I think that the mother's health should be put first and a 13 year old is most likely not able to go through a pregnancy without some sort of medical problems.     I am anti-abortion but your question is a grey area. I don't really see a problem with abortion in that case. What I have a problem with is grown accountable adults that are using abortion as a means of birth control, instead of taking responsibility for their actions.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Freedom of Choice!!|`|yDJiiqcsaa	The chances of a person being raped and not being advised to use "Plan B" and then getting pregnant is about one in 10,0000. It is simply a scenario used by pro-choice people to garner sympathy.  95% of abortions are "after the fact" birth control by lazy women .  I don't have to be a woman or know how difficult it is to carry/deliver a baby to recognize that abortion is killing a baby and most of the time it is for convenience sake.|`|vOgfAvMlaa	Most of the time women who are raped/molested do not fall pregnant. it does happen but not as often as people think it does. their body is so traumatized it shuts its self down and if on the off chance that there is an egg there to be fertilized (an average women has a 20% chance of getting pregnant during a cycle) it is harder for the pregnancy to stick. am i saying it never happens- no, i know it does happen but it is not an every day occurrence like most people think. so as using that for an excuse to say abortion is ok is unbelievable. if it does happen i think it is ok for them to take the plan b pill but i think they are the only ones who should be able to use it. and not when other forms of birth control "fail"  i have read stories of women who were raped and aborted their baby and they regret it for the rest of their lives and of women who have also been raped and kept their baby or given it up for adoption never regret it. ( i have worked for a pro-life committee trying to ban abortion in our state). you can never regret doing the right thing.     abortion is mostly used as birth control by teenagers or women who don't use their head|`|QYDIgOp0aa	I totally agree with you, I believe in Abortion and I get critisized for it all the time!!|`|90z6GK0iaa	A baby is a human being whether its being carried by a rape victim or a married woman.

Its a woman's body and she should do what ever she wants to do with it.|`|HrAvPcXpaa	i am kind of half believe in abortion  i mean if i say got pregenant from a rapist then yes i would get rid of it at the beginning.  however if i had a boyfriend and we were like propally in love and he got me pregant then i would have the baby. (im 13 and a half)    i mean i no the pregnancy would be difficult but i mean i wouldn't be able to live with myself if i got pregnant now was able to have the baby but i trashed it.then later in life when i am ready 2 have kids found out that i couldn't.i mean i would have trashed my onl chance at having a kid.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	yes i would want her to carry that baby for the 9 months and then give them up for adoption if that's what she chooses. we are not the ones that are killing the iraqi children the government is.|`|0Id85yiYaa	i agree with you|`|vwuMTm7Saa	There is a point when abortion should no longer be a viable option...lets say, when partial birth abortion is the only option.  At that point, I would say that there is a responsibility that they should have come forward and had the procedure earlier.  Abortion should not be a form of birth control, which it is for so many people.  That is a sick fact.
2f7d753df622c9c42a37e136f0451cb6aa	is he on the birth certificate as being the father?  If he is not and there is no paternity test then she can keep the baby away because there is no proof.

Unless its court ordered mom could pretty much do what ever she wants.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Your dad needs to get a lawyer.  Knowing the child is his and proving it are two different things.

2gegv4smaa	The timing of ovulation is complex and can take some studying of your body and your cycles to figure out. By using a combination of methods such as studying cervical fluid, taking your body temperature, and tracking your periods.    The day of ovulation differs from woman to woman and can even be different from month to month. The 14th day thinking appears to come from either taking the average of when all women ovulate or from someone just dividing the 28 day cycle in half. However this myth got started, it is not an accurate way to calculate ovulation, because many women do NOT ovulate on the 14th day of their cycle.    Most woman,Between day 12 and day 16 after her period. After menstration the uterus starts building up a lining from endothelial cells. Once this process is complete an ovium (egg) is released via the falopian tubes into the uterus awaiting fertilisation. If the ovium is not fertilised the lining on the uterus starts to break down from about day 27, thus causing a period. The day of ovulation is also of course when the woman is most fertile, as the ovium is fresh, and less prone to problems.    For women who have regular cycles, ovulating during your period is highly unlikely. Some women have very irregular cycles, maybe coming once every 3 months or 2-3 times in one month, and these women can have the odd occurrence of ovulating during a period or what is believed to be a period. Still, the chance of ovulating during a period is unlikely. But because sperm can live in the body for 3-5 days, pregnancy could occur from intercourse that takes place during a period.|`|BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|5gKQdZ6faa	find out at www.fitpregnancy.com/tools
hl5WdXnbaa	I agree with Roll_Tide, what makes a child too sick for day care can be a gray area sometimes. I have dropped my child of at day care with a tiny bit of a runny nose... then by lunch it was much worse and I had to pick him up. BUt if I kept my child home every time he had a runny nose..... that would be all the time in the winter.     I agree with you, sometimes kids need to stay home. Sadly most people can not always leave work so easy. Yes...sometimes people take personal days but don't assume that it is always for pleasure either.      And I think most parents care if their kid is sick, they may not seem like it ...but they could be frustrated because before they left work they received the 3rd degree from their boss or are stressed because now they need to find away to make up for the money that they now are out.     I don't think there is a solution...kids are going to get sick and parents need to work...it is a viscous cycle.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	presumably because they're worried about losing their job and not being able to provide for the children if they take the day off (or repeatedly take days off) to care for sick children.  i'm not saying it's a good idea, but i can understand that some people are desperate and don't have much in the way of options.    the provider is certainly within their rights to turn the child away, and the parent absolutely should have backup care.  the problem is the availability of backup care, which is something we should probably be addressing as a society.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Some parents dont have any other option. Maybe theyre out of sick days. Maybe they used up all their vacation days. Maybe theyre a single parent with no back up. Heck, maybe a married parent with no backup. Maybe their job is on the line and they cant afford to get fired. Right or wrong, sometimes we just get stuck.    If a child is clearly sick, a provider can reject the child at the door. You can send that child home immediately and call the parent immediately. Or call the next person on the call list if you cant contact the parent.     Ive been SO LUCKY where I have a sick daycare in my area. I would never have known about it if our daycare didnt tell us. Its great for parents that get stuck. I pay extra, $4/hr, but if it keeps me from getting fired and my child isnt deathly ill, then Ill do what I have to do. Ours is associated through the hospital. You may want to look in your area. I never heard of it prior to our daycare telling us so you might be surprised. And then, make fliers and pass them around at your daycare. And keep parents in the loop.    If you dont have one, then just send our reminder emails or notices about your daycare sick policy.    ** ADD **    Wow...you really think a GOOD parent is going to use up their vacation time for themselves? Honey, I use up my vacation time for the days my son is sick. Last year I used up ALL 2 wks of my vacation time in a matter of a month, due to my son and stepdaughter being sick. And I was SOL after that....then they start docking my pay. If they dock my pay, I don't have enough money to pay my electric bill or health insurance. It's not even NEARLY as simple as you make it out to be....|`|F6lZHRkVaa	When the provider sees the child is sick, they can call the parents immediately and say, "You need to pick up your child. They are sick."    There are some daycares out there that only take sick children, check with your local clinics and see if they know of any (here in Minnesota, the Mayo Clinic offers a daycare for sick children). You could always suggest this as a temporary fix or write it right into your contract.|`|gwUMipsUaa	How about the parent is a single parent, working their @ off to support their kids, and the other parent isn't doing one thing to support the kids, and the parent cannot take a day off?    Or the kid isn't sick when dropped off, but when picked up, they have a full fledged cold, flu, etc.|`|flqAr30laa	sometimes your boss can be difficult in such cases. Some jobs require that you find a replacement BEFORE you take any time off, which is crappy because you can't ever know that next thursday your child will have a fever and be vomiting.  If jobs were more flexible in such situations, it would help everyone.|`|44OH7Si6aa	Sometimes, parents are just in a rush and don't even notice that the kid might be sick so give the parents the benefit of the doubt. There is nothing you can really do about it other than call to have the child picked up. Understand that work places aren't usually very tolerant of parents taking off to care for sick kids frequently and make sure your policy isn't too strict and has very clear guidelines as to what symptoms will cause you to send the child home. That way, if the parent complains of too much absenteeism at work you can remind them of the policy.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Well, speaking for myself, my daughter loved nursery so much that she would swear blind she felt fine so she didn't miss out. Then, of course, she'd be there 20 minutes, realise that she really wasn't fine, and I'd get a phonecall... I'm sure the staff thought I'd dragged her there against her will.    You can tell parents to have a backup arranged all you like. How are they supposed to do that? Either they have relatives living close or they don't. What paid backup will agree to have someone's child only on short notice and only when they are sick? Some working parents abuse the system - but most do the best they can.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	I agree with the other answers, back up plan should be thought out, but sometimes the parent just can't miss work and plan B. falls through so daycare is the only option. I think the care center can turn them down if they need to, legally if its in the contract or whatever.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	Because they don't want to lose their jobs by calling in sick themselves every time their kid has a sniffle?    I personally wouldn't go against a policy that I was aware of when I started bringing the child, but if it was honest to god just a sniffle or if they weren't contagious or in need of any extensive extra attention, I'd still bring them in if I had to.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	People are very me-centric these days.  They avoid inconvenience at all cost, so the very idea that you might expect them to make other arrangements when their child is sick is unfathomable.  They don't care if the entirety of the facility becomes sick, they will not waste a vacation day being a parent!  It's like another question today about a parent who brought their sick child to work exposing the whole company.  It simply is not fair, and certainly not right, to subject other people to your personal problem.  Other parents work, so do they think they can afford their children getting sick.  It's selfish.  Very, very, selfish.      Whew!  I'm glad I got that out of my system.  When you deal with selfish people, you have to present the issue with a "what's in it for them" twist.  There was a story not long ago about an effort to get providers at a particular country's health care facilities to regularly wash their hands, especially between patients.  Compliance was only about 20% despite the cautions about the risk to patient health.  Only when they presented the issue with the risk to THEM from the patients were they able to increase compliance to about 75%.    I think the same approach is called for here.  Do not say "you're going to make ME sick," or "all the other children sick," say that with their child being immunocompromised for the time being, they risk worsening their own child's illness or possibly contracting something else.  These are the things they should have thought about before even getting pregnant.  Your kids are going to be YOUR responsibility. I'm reading all these "but what about their job, you have to understand" comments, but how is that anyone else's problem?   If you can't reliably provide for all of their needs, whatever they may be, every day until they're 18, don't have them.  Responsible breeding isn't just for kennels and catteries.|`|AA11995584	Define sick. A child with a runny nose is common thing. A rash like Molluscum Contagiosum is highly contagious yet not really harmful.   Most facilities have a direct policy regarding fever, yet a child on antibiotics is usually not contagious after 24 hours and a fever may still be occasionally present. A fever may be controlled by tylenol and no other symptoms like throwing up or the runs are there.     The fact is most kids are exposed to what ever virus is going around, and one child may have an ear infection and the parents never know it. (Our 3 year old never complains, and has had a few nasty ones).     The fact is some parents are much more anal about a few sniffs than others. If the handbook criteria is not met, there is no reason to keep the child home.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Most parents who have children in daycare can't always take off work when a child has the sniffles so they have to send the child in sick.  Some do use an emergency back up but they can't use that every time either.  It's really a catch-22 in the whole damned if you do, damned if you don't.|`|AA10494763	Because they are scared.  Many Many jobs discriminate against you when you have kids. They don't do it outwardly so you can prove it but they do.  When you miss to many days even if you have sick time they look at it badly.    You don't get that raise, promotion or they nit pick at your work so you quit or they fire you.    Also if you work a retail or another hourly job if you don't work you don't get paid plain and simple. They figure they need to save either their sick time or not getting paid for major sicknesses and not  every cold and sinful.   I get 10 sick days a year two kids and of course i get sick.  I drag myself into work with fever coughs and probably infect lots of people so that i can save my days when my kids are sick. Some people get less than that only maybe 5 a year some don't get any. I have one coworker that her son is always sick and she has used up all her sick and vacation days.  he is getting tubes next week and her parents have to come from out of town to sit with him because she has to go to work.   I know for you it is frustrating and we don't do it to be mean.  We do care about the kids and the provider but sending a child with a cold or not eating is a real decision some people have to make. We try to save our time for when they have a fever or the flu or something really bad.|`|AA11481889	One the one hand we have ....a kid with the sniffles that my daycare lady doesn't mind caring for  and remaining employed.....    And on the other we have jobless and on welfare so that we don't put out the baby sitter.    I thank my lucky stars that I found a daycare provider that has some common sense....because clearly there are plenty out there that lack the capacity to understand that it's a job and we're all human...humans get sick...    Have you never gone to work sick?  Are you selfish for going to work with the sniffles?      It drives me nuts when daycare providers come up here and bash the very parents that pay their rent.  You think it's easy leaving your kid with someone you know is only in it for the money??  An that you know is talking about you behind your back and judging your every move??    There's nothing worse than a daycare provider that is full of herself.      *********************  My provider has a clear policy and everyone sticks to it...but my last one ...on more than one occasion...would send us away at the door because my son "looked sick" ...that's complete BS and she was paid weekly not daily.      Fever, vomiting, sever cough...of course..you stay home with baby...but a cold?  No that's ridiculous.  He goes with a cold unless he's clingy and wants his mommy...then he stays with me.|`|le3zvYqJaa	Because they probably have no choice and have to go to work so they act like nothing is wrong, but if my child was sick i would stay home with him/her and try not to infect others.|`|6Z9VbuAJaa	most likely because:  they are cannot miss work  they have no other option and don't have family nearby to watch the child  they don't really care  =)|`|e758fb3958a37c72824b506ee2786432aa	It will happen over and over and over again. There really isn't anything they can do except have the child picked up when the he/she is sick, and until they get picked up keep that child semi away from the other children and clean clean clean.    I suppose the provider could implement an additional charge say, if the parent says they can't pick the child up for a while. If you call asking to have the child picked up you could say, it's going to be an additional 20 dollars for every half hour after 20 minutes from now. That would be incentive to hurry to pick the child up, therefore lessening the exposure of sickness.|`|JWa78QVoaa	Because some people cannot afford to stay home and not earn money.  I wouldn't call into question their amount give a crap for their kiddo, and to do so is irresponsible as a parent on your part.  I'm sure that you wouldn't like to be judged based on something you cannot help, and don't try to rationalize your position by saying that you know their situation because clearly you don't. Count your many blessings.|`|lr9E8IC5aa	I don't know but it drives me crazy. My 2 year old is a sickly little guy and I'm ALWAYS getting calls from the day care to come pick him up for this or that. And of course, he can't go back until he is fever/sick free for 24 hours. I have a back up sitter, but she is 45 minutes away. But I always have to make that drive or bring my kids to work with me. Yet, the other day I over heard a 3 year old tell another child that he got sick 3 times the night before and 1 time that morning, but his mom had to go to work.    I left the day care and called the director pitching a fit. Needless to say, the child wasn't there at pick up.|`|FsmcCXlvaa	I totally understand and to tell you the truth it isn't your problem, it's the parents'. It sounds like you've done the best you can to be fair to the parents and give them advice about what to do when their child is sick. There isn't anything you can do differently other than refuse to watch the child if they are sick. If mom/dad bring the child and you know they are sick just tell them, "I'm sorry, but I cannot take care of your children when they are sick. You'll need to make other arrangements until the child is well."    I'm a home child care provider and one of my parents always tries to bring the kids when they are sick and I'm not talking about a runny nose. I tried to be all polite at first and said I'd see how it went and let her know. But once you take that sick kid it's next to impossible to get some parents to come back and pick them up. This problem parent actually tried to bring her kids to my house when they were sick with food poisoning. She said they weren't contaigous so it was okay. Excuse me, your kids are vomitting and have diarehha, how is that okay?     We all wish our daycare kids have parents with good judgement, but unfortunately some of them don't. I just say that if the child has a fever, vomitting, or diarehha I cannot watch them. It's a health issue and is unfair to the other children and myself. How would they feel if you were playing nurse all day to a sick and contaigous child and spent hardly any time with their child? Then their kids get sick. It's hard to be the bad guy, but it's what I've started doing and so far it's the only thing that works. When mom tells me the kids aren't feeling well I ask what the symptoms are. If they are going to require more than a tissue and some Tylenol then I tell the parents no. If the kids would get sent home from school for the same symptoms then I don't allow them to come to my house.     Our job is tough enough as it is. We are child care providers not nurses. Parents need to do their jobs and take a sick day to take care of their own children. I have two kids of my own and when they are sick I call my parents and tell them that they need to make other arrangements. My kids follow the same standards of care as my daycare kids do and I'm not going to expose everyone to an illness because I don't want to upset the parents.     Sorry for the rant but I'm having some issues with parents lately and it's a touchy subject. You're doing everything right and just need to put your foot down and stand up for yourself and the other children in your care. Good luck!|`|Kr09aQJkaa	It's because you can't be and do everything.     The boss expects 100% from the employees. The boss can't put his business on hold for every case of chicken pox, fever and flu. The doctor told me that the average child has 13 illnesses each year. So for the boss that is 1 weeks vacation, 2 sick days and 13 call offs each year. Bosses aren't very sympathetic when it comes to personal problems because it affects their bottom line.    Being a parent takes 100%. Loving, teaching, feeding, clothing, protecting and being there takes everything you have and then some.     Putting your boss on the back burner will get you fired. Putting your kid on the back burner doesn't show any harm until it's too late.     The bra burners who said women can have careers, children, cook, clean, be mothers and fathers at the same time and this would make them feel fulfilled and free from marriage slavery should have had their heads examined. Women work 10 times harder today than they ever had. No wonder we are at higher risk for heart disease than men. Slow down ladies before we become extinct from pure exhaustion.    edit: You're right. I ran a daycare from my home many years ago and would see parents using me as a dumping zone. Some would be there to drop the kid off the second I opened and not be back til 30 seconds before I closed. They worked an 8 hour shift but would run by the store, get their nails done or go home to nap while their kid stayed with me for a full 12 hours. By the time you count getting ready and drive time this 2 year old would have a 15 hour day! OMG! I would also keep kids while their parents where on vacation so the parent could "clean" and do things that needed to be done. Even though I didn't charge for days that the kids didn't come to my home they paid anyway just so I would watch them. These kinds of parent where far and few between but even one is too many.|`|CbOwqvvJaa	I'm guessing that most of the people who leave sick kids are poor. I'm also guessing that they have a very limited education so they are only able to get very limited jobs. Most of the jobs in this limited range are the kinds of jobs that if you miss, you don't get paid and you get a strike against you.  In addition, I bet that all thier family members and friends are poor and have simlar jobs so they are not able to help out and be a back up.    So parents could leave the kids at home, not make money or drop off the kids at the daycare. Which one is the most caring?    I guess in this situation I'm describing, the daycare could make the prices higher so only the elite could afford daycare... or maybe stop accepting CCMS customers.

But I'd also like Rosalinda Kate, or Rosalinda Cate.|`|wsHgMp93aa	Rosalie Kate is a beautiful name..|`|x0INaVNqaa	I like Rosalie Kate the best. I love the name Rosalie, but not too keen on Kate. It's a nickname for Katherine/Katelyn/Kathleen. It just looks a little awkward together The full name versions of Kate don't really flow. How about Rosalie Mae or Rosalie Ann instead?  Rosalind is too long and reminds me of a frumpy old lady, so I wouldn't use that. Callie, on the other hand, is too childish. Its cute for an kid, but as an adult she won't be taken seriously. Callista would be a better choice.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Rosalie Kate, definitely.|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I love Rosalie Kate!!!

I love the name Rosalie, but it sounds a little awkward with Kate.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Rosalie Catherine or Rose Catherine.    Callie is a nickname. It is childish and will not age well. Kate is also a nickname. I honest prefer just Rose to longer Rose names.    If you want to use Callie, use it as a nickname for Calliope or Callista. I still would not use Rose as a middle though, seeing that is overused and filler.    [Edit] Callie definitely is too childish. I cannot imagine anyone past the age of five with the name Callie. You have to take into consideration that she will grow up and want a career.

AA12145826	Hotel for Dogs might be a good choice. Its a movie about 2 kids who decide to adopt all the stray dogs in the city and put them up in an abandoned hotel. As for par with most movies of this genre, expect lots of jokes about dog poo.    The only other "new" kids movie out right now is Coraline which is based on the book of the same name by Neil Gaiman and is animated by the same artists who made Nightmare Before Christmas. The previews kind of scare my daughter, so I haven't done much research on it, but all the critics' reviews seem to be in favor of it.    Both movies are rated PG. I'll link reviews for them movies below.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	There's Hotel for Dogs http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/...    and Bedtime Stories might be still playing near you:  http://www.apple.com/trailers/disney/bed...

Sounds like a winner to me!|`|hSJnaysiaa	There is one out I know called "Hotel for Dogs". And I believe a portion of the proceeds from this movie go to the Humane Society so its for a good cause...AND there is a Hairless Chinese Crested in the movie-which you could probably care less about, but that's what first attracted me to that movie (I love the breed and own many of them). I haven't seen the movie yet, but I'm sure its good, any movie with Hairless Chinese Cresteds in it has to be good, right?
p2MpqvCPaa	ever heard of therapy?|`|dPULl5hjaa	too much drama - childish and immature|`|3OP1YIXCaa	8th grade isn't high school. High school starts in 9th or 10th grade...depending on if elementary school ended in 5th or 6th.       but for your question. DONT get together with him. Just grow up and get over him. It will be hard but it is better than going through it all again.
Mt5du1y1aa	I had it where I did not ovulate that month and I got all the pregnancy symptoms and was not pregnant. i had to go on provera to get my period back that month. I guess it was maybe because of stress.|`|6JHyLgsAaa	There are A LOT of things that could be causing these problems that are not pregnancy.    I have poly cystic ovarian syndrome. it causes my periods to be irregular and for my ovaries to hurt too much.  there are also things like endromitriosis that could be causing it.    Go to the doctor and talk out the problems|`|CG5L6Fm6aa	my breast are really sore didn't have period since oct. cause i m/c in dec. i just went to the doc and they found out i was yesterday. my ovary didn't hurt though just my breast and my tummy a lil

zHRWklEWaa	If you've been on the pill for three months you are almost definetly not pregnant. Even if you weren't the chances of being pregnant on your period are not great, certainly possible but not probable.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Extremely slim. If you are on the pill and taking it correctly, it's most unlikely that you'd get pregnant regardless of your other precautions. You are just as protected on the sugar pills as at any other time during the month.    I mean, about 4 in 1000 people who are having regular sex taking just the pill (correctly) will get pregnant in a YEAR. Once and he didn't even finish? The chances are vanishingly small.|`|sA1ztaEpaa	I doubt your pregnant because you are taking the pill.. However it IS possible because I got pregnant on the pill, and now have a one month old daughter to prove that the pill is NOT 100% !!    Take a pregnancy test in a couple weeks.. but it's highly unlikely.|`|XElaAuHHaa	If you have taken your pills correctly, you will not be at any more risk than at any other time of the month.|`|IUQZFrMfaa	should this be in the adolescent section?

So did the parents of the kids that do such things.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Looks like there is no legal age in Arizona, but 12 years old is the generally acceptable age.    http://www.latchkey-kids.com/latchkey-ki...|`|1N2wBw3Uaa	13.|`|AZRj3vaLaa	girls 12 boys 13 or 14|`|AA12220250	actually when u feel there time is right and knows how to handle situations and can deal with them and u feel its safe 4 them to handle it.|`|sxecXFgraa	There is no legal age.

I'm thinking 11|`|5k9XizbMaa	There's no age specifically documented as a law in any state, it's just at what age you feel comfortable. Most people would say 10 at the earliest. Preferably not so early though.|`|aXALjavKaa	Its Should Be 12. They Might Have Changed It.. Im Not for Sure Tho. I Use 2 Live In Williams Az. Like 6 Years Ago.|`|iyL6dyMyaa	In my honest opinion, you might can get away with 14, but only if that child demonstrates that he/she can be trusted.  Don't leave anything that they may be tempted to get into, like computers, chat lines etc.  Anything younger than 14 maybe too young, but it depends on your child's behavior.  I was a latch key kid in the second grade on up.  But I also loved to watch tv, didn't have a computer, didn't like boys, and I watched my little sister, but of course this was back in the 80's.|`|wwB3csfYaa	I don't think there is an age. My Mom left me at 6 years old to care for my baby sister all the time.|`|g7XmorbCaa	Depending on the maturity of the individual child I would say 12 or 13. Some are ready -Some aren't. Make sure there not scared and make it fun for them-I was a Latch Key Kid -Even the name made it fun. My mom left snacks already prepared in the fridge or on the counter for when I got home-All kids are hungry after school. Maybe a list of a chore, or two and homework-Then T.V.. I was cool until she got home.|`|xotiIPK4aa	12, I would say. But not for too long. 2 hours at most, expand time according to their age|`|fwMB2TWSaa	Well see it depends. It is really YOUR decision. But I am a mother myself, and my daughter is 12 now and stays home by herself. But she really started staying home alone at the age of 9. It just depends how you feel about it. And, yes, I am very sure if she is at the age of 8 or older, she might be complaining about how she wants to start. And this will be normal, they all will want to start staying home alone at one point. But it is really just your decision. If there have been strange things going on around the neighborhood maybe, you might want to think about letting your child start at another time. I feel actually pretty ashamed personally because a lot of times in the past, my daughter would stay home alone and I would get a call from her complaining about people knocking on the doors or you know, things like those. But it is your determination. How old is the child? I would at least say if she/he is at least 10 or higher, they should be able to. This is my personal thought. It is now up to you to think about it. Thanks.
x647LeB2aa	Most children get chicken pox before they start school, especially if they are in regular contact with other children such as at nursery or preschool.    My son was around 15 months when he got chicken pox but my daughter was four before she got it.    I would not deliberately expose your child to the virus - my daughter was better able to understand why she should not scratch and coped better than my son and, being older, she was able to vocalise her headache/itches whereas he was just very miserable. However, if your boy does get it young it won't be a major problem.  They are only really 'ill' for about three days (temperature etc although the spots last about 2 weeks)|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Deans, chicken pox vaccination is not routinely available in the UK.    I wouldn't give it to her deliberately, though.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	most people will say this is wrong and give me thumbs down, but yes i think i would, if your child gets it when they are older it will be shingles, and iv herd its dangerous and not very nice at all, shes 15 months, so not like a new born, years ago if any child had chicken pox, they would invite all the children around they knew so they could all catch it together and get it over with|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Absolutely not. I would do anything to prevent my children from getting sick. That is why they all have been vaccinated for chicken pox. I had it when I was little and it was miserable. Don't make your child go through that.|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	OK firstly the chicken pox vaccine isn't in the UK so rule that one out!    Now lol, i'll get loads of thumbs down for this but i'm honest..    YES!    I did with my two youngest and they had the pox bad but manageable. the likelihood of a child getting the pox in the early years is probable and when they're small you can control the scratching and the treatment.  One of my sons had it when he was 7 and he was in agony. he had them in his ears, mouth and under his nails. he was in bed for a week and the doctor made regular trips to see him.  Chicken pox can be fatal in some extreme cases but on the whole those that get it young manage better than adults.|`|145RUNQHaa	My daughter had chicken pox age 5 and my son was 19 months.i can honestly say that my son had it a lot worse than my daughter.for a start my son had more spots he was covered and i could explain to my daughter not to scratch so she only got one scar on her stomach but it was impossible for my son to fully understand and although we did try putting cotton gloves on him to stop him scratching he still ended up with scars all across his forehead and chest.i wouldn't purposefully put them together so he can catch it chicken pox affects different children in different ways.once you have had chicken pox you are then at risk of possibly getting shingles in the future.think it through.|`|AA11885437	Has your had the vaccine for chicken pox yet? They usually give those at 12-15 months unless you deny it. I don't know enough kids around here to be able to do that, so my daughter got the vaccine at 12 months, but I would have preferred her gaining immunity naturally. I had chicken pox when I was 8 and survived just as all my friends and classmates did. It was like a childhood right of passage. I don't know about getting it at 15 months though,  most children used to get it when they were school age. It might be a little rougher on someone so young. Its up to you...but check your shot records because if you already had the vax, its kinda pointless.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Why not just let her get vaccinated?    cathrl69- thanks, I was wondering how I stumbled upon so many thumbs downs on this answer.|`|9p9DDRSnaa	no way|`|drzN1kkuaa	just get her vaccinated!|`|SuMwWNfyaa	um,it sounds cruel when its put that way.      but um,i suppose so.it is actually better.just keeep alot off that soothing skin stuff on hand.      Only put her near your friend's daguhter is chickne box is extremely commmon where you live.      i mean    EXTREMELY common.    other than that,dont.|`|OlPwUM8aaa	My sister got CP when she was 16 and scared pretty badly from it. I exposed my child at 22 mnths and she has no scarring. You can get a vaccine from it but my paediatrician told me it is only so effective and that many end up getting them later in life anyway. He also said the best vaccine is to suffer through it and get the natural immunity which comes from having them and better when they are to young to scratch  or suffer the adult version.|`|oP8blO9Paa	i have known parents that did that so there children can get it over with.  its supposedly not that bad at that age|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Yes definitely.  When they get chicken pox at that age it barely registers with them.  They get spots but don't feel that ill.    It's much better to get the immunity now.  I know a few people who have had it as adults and been very ill for weeks.    Get as as many vaccinations as are offered as well as people don't realise that diseases like measles can kill.|`|eXnzPp4oaa	A lot of people do this, but personally with my daughter I chose not to. I think just let nature run its course, i've never had chickenpox and im 17.   Chances are your child will get chickenpox anyway at some time.|`|93d1272e676f48f0eee8d8378c0b91f2aa	it is better if they get it younger. if as an adult you haven't had chicken pox it comes as shingles and that is very dangerous. my husband got it and you only get down one side of your body, my daughter got chicken pox and he developed shingles as a result of it. he was sick for a while. all my kids have had chicken pox and it is easier when they are younger to deal with it, plus less dangerous.|`|rxqZ1nLgaa	Yes definitley. My uncle managed to avoid getting them until he was in his 30s and ended up in hospital with them. As unfortunatley the effect can worsen with age. He had them on the inside of his throat and his eyelids, as well as being covered with the things all over the rest of his body.   Although it may cause a lot of screaming a crying at first it will be worth it and also means when there is an outbreak at school when thier older you get to avoid all of the hassle later on.|`|aWWgPkryaa	Why not wait until you have had another baby and that baby is about 15 months or so....then find someone with chicken pox, that way you only have to suffer once!!      (or twice if you do the same thing with 4 kids!)|`|AA10593735	if you can't get your toddler vaccinated (varicella is the name of the vaccine by the way), don't purposefully put her in the situation of having chicken pox, at least not right now.  Prime age for doing that is when they are between 4 and 6, and by that point they have usually received the vaccination anyway.|`|6cwJi5kxaa	I would have to say Yes. Its not going to her your toddler. But just as an FYI, Just because you get the vaccine doesnt mean you cant get chicken pox.|`|5XAfsSosaa	Give it a go. There is no guarantee it would work though! You haven't said whether you have a girl - if so, if she doesn't catch chickenpox in childhood then it's more risky as an adult - particularly if she becomes pregnant. In any case to catch chickenpox as a child is better than as an adult - it could develop into shingles.     If your toddler does develop chickenpox, it could still be very distressing - particularly when you have to try & ensure he/she doesn't scratch the spots - they are very young to understand why they shouldn't! There are varying degrees of the illness too. My daughter was ill - cold/flu symptoms for a few days beforehand but once the spots appeared you wouldn't have known she was ill apart from the spots! She was 4 at the time. A couple of weeks later my son, then 6 caught it & he was covered in spots almost head to toe - including the soles of his feet & also his buttocks. He was quite poorly as well, but I'm told this is more likely in a blonde child like him, whereas my daughter is dark-haired.       To my knowledge, there is NO vaccination for chickenpox - certainly not in the UK.|`|duCfpHffaa	u must be kidding|`|DPegPYRPaa	Ask your pediatrician!|`|Ms8b2kISaa	This reminds me of that episode of South Park when the parents tried to get all the kids to go to Kenny's and get Chicken Pox LOL...I don't at all believe in vaccinating against Chicken Pox, because of the problems it can cause with Shingles in adulthood, which is 5,000,000 times more horrible than the Chicken Pox. At 15 months I wouldn't deliberately give it to her, just due to the fact that you can't really explain to them why they can't scratch or rub the pox, etc., and any of the ointments you can put on them to relieve the pain and itching probably can't be used on such a young baby. I would ask your doctor, but I really don't think it's a good idea until she's a bit older. I had them when I was about 10 and it was awful then, I can't imagine having them when you're not even 2 and no one can explain what's happening!
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Just leave. Find an apartment. You can move out at 18. How close is your birthday? Just start making plans. Find an apartment for the month of your birthday and apply for it. ??|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I believe that technically you arent supposed to move out on your own but the police will not go after a "runaway" who is 16 years or older. You are also old enough to decide whether or not you will continue your education, which I hope you will considering the life of you baby. There are homes out there for pregnant teen moms who are abused or kicked out of their parents house. I would contact social services. If you walk into an office with a bag of clothes and tell them you have nowhere to go....they will help you. Good luck!|`|sA1ztaEpaa	No. You need to report it to the police. And if emancipation and marriage to the father is out of the question, she will be waiting until she is 18 to move out, unfortunately. It is illegal for an un-emanicipated minor to move out without parental permission.|`|4a2b1a81a9c8031e2a999ddf51108881aa	I believe (BELIEVE - you'll have to check the regulations of your area) that pregnancy is an automatic emancipation.    I tend to doubt that parents who abuse their child in ANY way would turn around and grant them emancipation...|`|tu7aqUoxaa	GET A POLICE REPORT AND DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT FOR YOU AND THE BABY|`|SpYS7VYoaa	Theres always running away and living in a shelter for abused mothers and children or underage mothers (my mom did that as well as my sister and law and the places are pretty nice) But legally, your still your parents. You could always call the cops or the department of children services (but they dont help much unless you have clear evidence, my friend is awfully abused, but without hard evidence they can do nothing) If I were you, I'd try for emancipation becuase they can rush it in special cases.  Good luck|`|eXnzPp4oaa	Yes from age 16 onwards a person can move out of their parents household, although assuming they arnt really rich, they would have to do so through the council housing register which can take a very long time to get you a house. However your situation may put you as a priority above some others.     Good luck|`|z6Vmgw5Waa	No you can't unless the court says you can, so if your parents are abusing you in any way you need to tell your authorities and file for emancipation
g2QUNwZzaa	if you really want to think that they arent going to have a party...then...well... have fun :)    do you forget what being 13-18 was like? theres nothing quite like having your own house open without parents on a friday night. they will find ways to deal with your neighbours. or make up some kind of radical excuse. us kids are crafty these days|`|AA11210211	Depends on them and if they are mature enough,It is hard to say if I would or not because I don't know the teens.|`|4PK0hiWeaa	Yeah if you think the 18 and 15 are responsible then go ahead especially if you got neighbors checking in.  You got to trust them sometime.|`|8b976b2f9d559004564384a0e185cc1caa	Well it depends are they related?|`|00A3BfSEaa	Ya they are old enough to trust.|`|4582a857fe73584c0fff40c4f1537198aa	that would depend.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Yes. The oldest is 18 so that should be fine since you have the neighbors looking out.|`|3gXQPso5aa	no|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	Hell no.|`|xc6iCPUQaa	It really depends.     1. Are they related or friends??  2. Are they all boys or all girls, or both??|`|1xkc6Ktmaa	Usually they're going to do what they're going to do one way or another. Might as well have it happen on your turf.|`|nXrAkx8Iaa	yea i would if i have neighbors checking in on them my parents were able to leave me and my bros home by ourselves when they were gone for long weekends i think if you trust them then you should see it as a test for them to see how much you can trust them|`|ZaadvJAXaa	No!|`|s6emVQleaa	My parents left us for a week when my brother and I were in high school with a brother in junior high and one in elementary.  I would think at your ages you would be just fine overnight.|`|62vCoDPjaa	nope. no telling what they could get into|`|pQBjqMkoaa	No no no no no|`|mvuHYNpjaa	ya but im 14|`|iXt3erseaa	Sure - as long as the neighbours are around. Make sure that the 18 yr old is ok with it though.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	as a 17 yo i would say no because i would be getting in trouble|`|UP8F6PDMaa	Oh No!|`|8D8ck9pVaa	Yes|`|NIEt2CEZaa	Well if they're are responsible then i would say that's okay for just overnight, but if the oldest ones are not responsible then no.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	We leave our two teens 16 alone that long or longer.  Your 18 yr old is an adult and the questionable 17 year old is almost an adult and should have expectations of good behavior set on them.  So, yes, I would.|`|SUs4rN49aa	If the 18 year old and the 17 year are responsible, and you can trust them to look after the other two, then I don't see why not.   It's a good chance to see how they behave while you are gone... and if the neighbors are checking in on them, then that is good as well. You can also call the heck out of them too!|`|Nzc7t6KEaa	Give them some freedom. See it as a chance for them to show you how independent they can be.|`|zPLza1dSaa	Uhm, not all teenagers throw partys when there parents/ gaurdian is away. Im a teen and i haven't never done it.  All i would do is check up on them like every 30minutes to and hour. Like call in and see if you hear anything in the background. If you call a couple times and no answer then that means yea go back.|`|x3AJj3GXaa	Yes but set boundaries and it's good that the neighbors are checking.   Also, this could teach them responsibility.  It is also a way for you to show them that you trust them but of course, they have to win your trust too and let them know that if they mess it up, well then you will no longer trust them.  It's for your benefit and theirs too.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	No way! Teens are hormonal, impulsive and irresponsible. Even the honor roll students, even the quiet ones and even the ones with bright futures.   Have someone stay in the house with them. An aunt, grandma or adult friend.    When the cat is away the mice will play!|`|Dimi8By2aa	It really depends on the kids. If you guys will just be watching movies and hanging out, then it's totally okay. But if you're going to be smoking pot or something stupid like that, then no.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	I would leave them home alone but only if the neighbors check in and respond to any inappropriate behavior.  You need a break every now and again you know! :)|`|F0sQ18MKaa	Of course. Cut them some slack. They are probably much more mature than you give them credit for. Kids their age have started record labels and companies!|`|lSl2Arlpaa	yeh sounds fine to me :)|`|LlxAgQXPaa	If there family, yes, let them stay.   But if there mates, Then no.    They can get up to things o.O    :D  -     LiKE.DUDE.|`|avpv7u8saa	It depends on how long you will be gone|`|jbdy6HABaa	Yeah i cant see why the wouldnt be alright.  just make sure the neighbours check in every hour.   Aslong as YOU trust the eldest one|`|AA11325614	no because even though the neighbors check in they can still have a party until the neighbor gets there|`|22TnQ7vPaa	they're ur kids rite? or is it ur kid/kids with some other school kids with mixed genders. if it's a mixed gender unknown friend thing i wouldn't. U dont want ur girls' breaking bad news to u in a week. and same with ur boy. If they're all ur kids then, yeah! why not? u need to give ur kids a chance to show u they're responsible. And if ur neighbor's are checking in every so often i think it wud be ok. But if they blow it thats it! hire them a babysitter!|`|LknYI7FFaa	you need to ask your self, do you trust your kids. sounds like you don't if you have to ask everyone for their opinion. and half of your responses will be by kids them selves|`|Luf2zbTKaa	well if the neighboos are checking in on them and you trust your kids and nieghbors then i say you should do it|`|GdCyjERPaa	I would do it. Leave the most responsible (18) in charge and everything should be fine.|`|f3e3995482cfe1f0696a3a95fa2b6ed1aa	It just doesn't seem safe to me, anything could happen, although the 18 year old should be of decent age to handle the situation, she could get mixed up with the maturity of the other girls and not be responsible, so i would say no.|`|G8IRX295aa	nope, you rnt want them having s*x with their bf/gf.|`|2FoMlJnLaa	I would say yes. Though, trust your own instinct, as not all teens are total idiots...|`|8M1QvFI4aa	you hav to give j=kids freeedom, the mnore you trust the mnore they wont go off and do stupid things. all the kids i kno whos parents are rly tough on then=m and dont let them do mmuch are the ones who smoke, and drink and arre lik rly sexually active...|`|np6QvkOyaa	Well only if they are related. But other than that i think it is a great experience  for them. But try to make it home a little early. Also make sure the neighbors don't forget to check up on them :)|`|Gedrh8oeaa	Yes  its a good chance for them to gain your trust. Those type's of situations can get bad sometimes, but if you have someone checking then there isn't much of a chance. it lets the kids know you have trust in them, and if it works out well-which it probably will- you will have a new gained trust in them. Also, don't you remember being a kid? Just the fact of being home alone is the highlight of your month! "remember that one time mom left for the night, we stayed up alll night, and had pillow fights, and dressed up in their clothes " silly things like that are what create  great memories of childhood/teenager-hood.|`|m5XQamtLaa	Yes. They seem to be at a responsible age, or at least some of them. As long as you trust them and they know the rules, they should be fine. With the neighbors checking in on them frequently, there should be no problems. It's good to let teens have some responsibility once in a while, go ahead with your plans!      Good luck!|`|o8ROmRbAaa	Hmmmm it depends... I would probably let the kids over night. From what you told me they sound responsible. It kind of depends on what time of year and what type of person you are. I wouldn't let the kids stay over night during school... but that's just me.|`|gNriZVv9aa	It all has to do with trust, really. Trust is earned, you can't just expect it. If the parents have trust in their children, then here is no reason not too seeing as the neighbors will be checking in. If they mess this one up, the parents should know not to do it again. Its all about lessons being learned and trust being gained.|`|2f7d753df622c9c42a37e136f0451cb6aa	hell no!|`|oM6Pem1Waa	If they get along then yeah but if they don't I don't recomend you doing it!|`|DPegPYRPaa	Yea I don't see why not. The 18 year old is pretty much an adult right?

M7Ozqujtaa	You shouldn't feel sorry for us! I wanted siblings when i was younger.... But not anymore! I'm older and happy being a only child! i have best friends and they are like my siblings! Theres nothing to feel sorry for we aren't lonley! and we aren't spoiled and brats in fact we might even get it worse being a only child! I love being a only child now that i'm older i never really had a time where i was like "i want a sister...." or "i want a brother..." its my family and im happy with it just the way it is.|`|FsmcCXlvaa	I grew up with two sisters and my husband also comes from a family of three kids. I couldn't imagine raising an only child and am expecting my third in September. I have a few cousins that are only children and they hate it. They always wanted siblings and both have gone on to have at least two kids of their own. I don't think affordability is enough of a reason because somehow things always seem to work out. The first one is the most expensive but the second and third don't seem to cost as much because you already have most of what you need. Health Insurance is another story though. I just think having one child is kinda mean. Parents always try their best but nothing they do is going to change the fact that their child doesn't have a sibling. At the time it may seem like a good idea but what happens when the kids become adults and the parents are older and pass away. That only child is really alone with no brothers or sisters to share the burden. So sad to imagine going through tough times as I get older without my sisters. They mean everything to me and I lean on them more as I get older.|`|kw80YHMLaa	I'm not an only child but i have a friend who is and she said its the worst thing that ever happened to her and her life was so boring as she lives in the country. As for money and not being able to afford a child, its understandable but love of a child is better than money they would get by. Her age is not major my mother had a child at 45|`|pnL5WTXMaa	your sil sounds like she's got a good head on her shoulders and will be a good mom. - to her only child.|`|9CrN1kF2aa	well think of all the stress and the more struggles they'll have to go threw i mean if sh is already struggling thinking how much babies cost they are not cheap and also when you think of the welfare and stuff she might have to applie fo just to get threw and if she doesn't have enought money her and her kids might go hungry also yo ucan think about the well being of the kid what they might see like thier mother cryign trying to figure out how she is going to figure how she will even get by..........think of other than just your self thier are others who might suffer to.|`|jTkJbTc6aa	well i was an only child till my mom got married...when she got married it brought two step siblings into my life, but they were both older then me and moved out of the house right before i was moving in, so i never had them around so in a way it was like being an only child and growing up my whole life i would always wish that my mom would have another child, i think that if you are able to have two or more kids then it is a great idea so that your kids dont get bored easily and will always have a playmate no matter what happens.    just my thoughts|`|TQW5E6olaa	They have very good reasons for not having a 2nd.    I was an only child. Occasionally I did wish for siblings, but it was mostly while I was younger and like a thought one afternoon when I had nothing to do, not daily for years. I did not suffer in any way not having sibings. I also wished for a pony, that one I did wish for every day for years, I got horseback riding lessons instead.     I had a great childhood, only children get along just fine thank you!    My daughter may be an only child, I am totally okay with it and so will she.|`|utfoP7GWaa	I was an only child, and i only plan on having one child.   (my husband has a daughter already!)    my reasons why, are:  we know financially we can give just one child a better life  it's easier to travel (which we do a lot!)   they already have a half sib  and I have a bladder disease that is making my pregnancy somewhat miserable!|`|vue9NOhYaa	I have only one child.  It is primarily for medical/fertility reasons (I didn't feel myself able, emotionally or financially to go through it all again), but also for practical reasons. (Small home, financial issues.)    And yes, money DOES matter. If they don't have insurance or good jobs, it's VERY sensible of them to not have another child -- at least not right now. Myth aside, you can't live on love alone.    My daughter has sometimes (mostly when much younger) wished for a sibling, but she understands why she can't have one, and she's really fine with it.  She's NOT lonely (she has friends and classmates -- she's also a bit of an introvert anyway; not sure if that's genetic [I'm one], or a result of being an only, but it means that she doesn't need to be contantly in crowds of people) and shes NOT spoiled. (We ARE able to give her more material things than she might have gotten if she had siblings, but she certainly DOESN'T get everything she wants.)    My only real concern about her only-child status will be for later -- when her dad and I get older, she won't have siblings to turn to for support.      There are pros and cons to every family size.  So each family makes the best choice they can for their life, or, if it's not a choice, they play the cards they are dealt.)|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It's not for me, but some people prefer that, and that's their decision.     I think given your SIL's situation, she is very wise to think that way. She sounds mature, responsible, and not inclined to get herself into something that could be potentially disastrous, in a sense. Good for her - I wish more people thought that way.     On the flip side, though, for some people there is never enough money. People that put it off or refuse to have more because of money often, unlike your sister's situation, have the means to support another one but won't, because they like their lifestyle and don't want to make sacrifices or compromises. That I don't necessarily agree with, but oh well.     I was an only child from my parents marriage, but I have a plethora of half and step siblings. It wasn't all that bad for me; I had playmates but really enjoyed time to myself, which I still do, probably because I was an only child. But I think it's what motivated me to want kids - I"m expecting my third - because I wanted them to have that connection with someone else that I didn't have. My mom wanted more, but they got divorced before it could happen. And honestly, I'm kind of glad! LOL Because I can't imagine my life any other way. I'm happy with whom I've become and hold no grudges or harbor any resentment from being an only, maybe because I still had steps and halves (none of whom - except for one, who was a distant nearly 7 years older than me - did I share a home or regular upbringing with). As an 'only,' I think I turned out just fine and perfectly well-adjusted. LOL|`|AA10494763	Well I know two only kids one wished for sibiling one did not to the point that he only wants one kid.  There is no way of knowing if they will lonley.  They can always hang out with friends etc.   Second question is yes i think you need to take fiances into account when family planning.  My wife would love a third child but that would be a big strain two is enough.|`|9kPPmazoaa	I can't speak for them.   But on a personal level I came from a large family and loved every minute of it. I couldn't imagine my life without siblings, but thats probably because thats what I am used to.     In our situation we have one little girl now and definitely plan on having more.We just love being the mom & dad to our daughter. She brings soooo much joy to our lives we get so excited thinking of having more... and the joy they will bring. But thats us... and our living situation (jobs, house, ages, etc) are different.    Its a decision every person has to make on their own. What I may think is a small family, to some may be the perfect size. And while we want to have more children. To someone else they may just want to have one. To each his own.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I don know any only children lol.  I only have one but hes only 14 months old, I do plan to have another soon.  And im raising his uncles so its like he has 2 older bros.  But I don feel sorry for them. If i really couldn afford it i wouldn have anymore.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	It's the responsible thing to do. If people did that then in 1 generation the world's population would half and we wouldn't have to worry about pollution, strained resources etc.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	i think it is better for a child to have siblings and i don't think the choice to have more children should be based on money after all back in the day it was considered normal to have 6+ kids and they really didn't have any money at all xx|`|3dSCbIcEaa	At first my husband and i both agreed that babies were a nuisance and unneccesary until our friends started having them.  We decided to have one and only one, u know, try anything once.  So we had our son and he was great but it was a lot of hard work and stress so we decided not to even think about another baby for at least 10 yrs.  So i got the 10 yr iud and 9 months later was pregnant. We had our second child last yr and they r both great.    I think if someone wants to choose not to have ne more kids for whatever reason it should be respected bc no one knows what that person went through with the first one and shouldnt expect them to go through the hell again.  I am glad that neither of my kids are only children and that i had a boy and a girl so im not missing out on those experiences, though.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Why do people make being an Only child seem like a plague? I was an only child growing up, my mom was pregnant at an older age and didn't want to go through pregnancy again. She always let me have friends over so i wouldn't be too lonely or isolated from others my age. I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me because of it. I had lots of cousins and neighbors to play with. Do only children wish for sibling, yes at certain times of course but don't children with siblings wish at times they would be an only child? I only wanted one so i wouldn't be the only one getting blamed for everything besides that i was fine. And yes people who can't afford children shouldn't be trying to have more babies they can't take care of. I like being an only child, it has  its advantages and disadvantages just like having siblings. So don't pity only children there is no reason to.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	I don't think anyone should have children just so their child can have a playmate. Many only children grow up just as social if they have parents who socialize them.     I have one sibling who died a few years ago. Growing up we fought like crazy but as adults we became very close. Being the only one in the family I hate it!     There are good points to being an only child and bad points just like everything else.|`|DPegPYRPaa	My niece is an only child and she loves it. Her parents can let her do things that others may not be able to afford with multiple kids.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i agree with most people here, you shouldn't feel sorry for only child.  I have an only child, she is perfectly happy and healthy (both physically and pychologically).  She does not have to go thru sibling rivalry, fighting for attention from adults, and always have our full focus.  Since our family has only 3 people, we can afford to go on trips more often.  She has a lot of cousins tho, and we set up playdate or outings with other families a lot so she has plenty of chance to play with others.      In my opinion, financial is a big part when it comes to making decision on having how many children.  Because kids are easy to make, but they cost money to raise.  Would you rather have a bunch of hungry kids, or one kid who is fully supported in every single way of her life?

IFDfpbFJaa	I went to google.com and searched it and found a lot, I'm not sure if it's what you're looking for or not or I would have posted the links here.      Good Luck.
IFDfpbFJaa	I had an alcoholic bipolar mom who was strung out on Meth who  was also abusive, more to my sister than me, and a dad who was working so many hours he didn't notice what was going on (or so I thought) but then my dad took me away from my mom (this was 14 years ago, my sister wasn't his) and they divorced and she continued having my dad in and out of court because she was too lazy to get a job, as a result my dad was never around and I was left to find my own ways to get to and from school and never had any sort of rules or discipline set on me. I'm lucky I turned out with a good head on my shoulders. But now I have no idea how to raise a child....I never had an example.     I told myself I would never be like my mom but I find that I am a lot like her. I get frustrated with my son easily and I'd rather do other things than play with him 100% of the time (because my mom never played with me very often) but I'm really trying to over come that and not continue the chain of dysfunctional(ness) she showed me.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	my dad made my childhood hard, but my mom made it easier.

I never doubted my family's love for me.  Although at the time, I always thought I had it tough.  My parents made sure we got what we needed but we had to work for what we wanted.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	My parents divorced when I was three. Their divorce was actually final on my third birthday. For a long time were weren't allowed to see our father because he was very abusive. So my mother worked very hard to give us a good child and I have many happy memories with her. She remarried a wonderful man when I was 8 and he has been the best father that I could have asked for growing up. So it had it's rocky points but overall was pretty good.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	From birth to 5 was extremely bad, 5-12 was absolutely horrible, 12-18 was better, but still not great.  19 was the worst year of my life.  Since then, it's gotten better and better until I can say now I have an almost perfect life.  And, I am eternally grateful that my daughter's life will be nothing like my own.|`|iyL6dyMyaa	I was born middle class, had a pretty good childhood dad was in the military but was on the verge of getting out by the time I came along.  Mom was the disciplinarian.  Life was good till the divorce.  With the divorce I seen less of dad, now my relationship with mom is strained because of resentment towards her and stuff her ex-husband did to me when she was at work.  I love my dad, but not close to him, he never calls me, his is remarried with 2 high school age kids.  He doesn't even check on his grandson.  I have resentment towards him as well.|`|kCiizn5oaa	Without wanting to go into too much detail I would give the same discription as you "very rocky"|`|nfzQkvqraa	If I have to be completely honest.....It had it's ups and downs.  I was left on my own way too early and way too often because of my parent's past time.  There weren't high expectations for me as a teenager because my parents numbed the motivational part of their brains or something.  But I have decent memories too.  I know my parents love me.  They just have some issues.  I am lucky though.  It could have been a whole lot worse.|`|AA12145826	My childhood was very Leave It To Beaver with former hippie parents raising 2 girls in the woods of northern Michigan during the 80's.

Some parts were better than others. My parents divorced when I was three and then my mom remarried to somewhat of a jerk, but he's improved somewhat with age - and I was the only one of his 'kids' (he has 5 older children) that stood up to him and wouldn't take his crap. :) I think as a result she was very depressed, but she never let on and allowed me to have a normal childhood as a result. I had no clue she was depressed - which is good, compared to my husband's mother who has had lifelong issues with depression and sometimes 'plays the victim' as a result.     I also have wonderful fond memories of my grandmother's farm and would like to move back to that area someday.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	From the time i was 2 to about 8 yrs old..it was horrid...

0bZ6j0aSaa	I actually really like Rosalie Kate.  I'm not so fond of the name Rosalind though, i think it sounds quite harsh, Roselie sounds very soft and pretty.    Anyways...back to Kate...    I like a lot of the 'Kate' names - they sound so classic and i don't think you can go wrong with them.  My favs are Kathleen, Catherine (I like it with a C but Katherine is good too!), Katie, Caitlin and Kate!    Rosalie Kate  Rosalie Katherine / Catherine  Rosalie Kathleen    Rosalie Caitlin doesn't sound just as good to me and i would avoid Rosalie Katie cos of the two 'Y' sounds at the end.

I would tell them if I waned to keep the baby, or if I wanted to abort. And if I wanted to keep the baby, I would explain to them how I would be able to support the baby.

It is going to be hard no matter what you do, but don't get angry or too defencive if they start yelling and screming at you. They will probably be upset, but if you wait till they stop yelling you could try to explain what happened at the party and stuff. You might want to think about what your going to do first, like with the baby (adoption, keeping it, abortion) so you can tell them your choice and talk about it. Let them cool of afterwards and if they need some time to think, don't be pushy, afterall this won't be easy for them. With friends, just tell them what happened and how (maybe have them sit down too), they should be ok and supportive.  I hope it all goes well!|`|pIBOSkfsaa	Nows the time to be and act responsibly. There will be no easy way to say it, and the reactions are going to be just as bad as you imagined, but there is really no turning back now, your just going to have to tell them, (your parents anyways) as for friends, i really believe your family has a right to know about this before they do. good luck to you.|`|94wxk1Y5aa	Tell the dude first, then his parents, then ALL of you sit down and talk about it.

To a friend I'm pregnat|`|z6Vmgw5Waa	Your parents need to know immediatelly, so you can start taking care of your pregnancy, ask your mom for a walk in the park and tell her.|`|zEZF5ITMaa	Talk to a school counselor or your pediatrician/doctor for some ideas about how to tell your folks.    If you have done a little research and have some options in mind, it might lessen the blow.    They are going to be upset though, because they love you and probably  wanted better for you.    It doesn't mean your life is over - it's just a detour that's a little unconventional.    Get into night school, get your GED. Learn a trade. Get a job.    It's just - you are now a grown-up overnight and that's a very challenging thing to go through.     If you want to continue to be "a kid", consider adoption - or whatever your beliefs are - to not have the baby if that's what you believe in (I'm not suggesting anything, it's your body and your beliefs).    You need to tell somebody though - it's a crisis and you need support.
ZXhpEuGpaa	I have two children, i have a 8 year old son and a 5month old daughter,and they were both good babies i was blessed they usually did'nt fuss much  unless in need of something but that was the key never let them be in need.My son was so independant,when he was 3 yrs old he got a tricycle for Christmas,and he took it out of the box and put it together himself,he did'nt put the screws in but he did the rest,it was amazing that goes to show how he was but i notice now he seems more needy,my daughter is a good baby but she is a little more demanding at first all she did was sleep now at 5 mths,she hates it when i leave the room,or walk away from her,my son did'nt care either way.Now them being eight years apart and being of the opposite sex everyone talks about how much they look alike,(affortunatlly my son is from my first marriage,and my daughter is from my second)so for them to look so much alike is great i always thought my son looked like his daddy,and same with my little girl,rather that has anything to do with your research or not i don't know,but being so much alike with separate daddy i find amazing i know they may have gotten alot of my traits but,they both look so much like their daddy's but so much alike.    I may have gotten off the subject but hope i was helpful.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	I don't think I saw a difference in my children within the first few days of life.

Babies sleep the first few days of life so we're talking about comparing sleeping babies.  I think more indicative of the child's personality is the way they were born.  My oldest was born so fast, after two hours of labor.  My second was very slow to come - prodromal labor for a day - my water broke and she was born 7 minutes later.  My oldest is just like that - a full ball of energy - loud, fast.  My youngest is mellow and easy going.|`|AA11738376	i have 3 children. my first 2 were very quiet after they were born. they both grew up to be very shy and quiet individuals. my 3rd child cried non stop for the first 48 hours of his life. he was a very confident child who was always on the go. he is still like this at age 21. love them all though. hope this helps.|`|WbJPQM1naa	I have seven children.  Yes, they all have very different personalities.  I have identical twin daughters and I noticed the differences in their temperaments very early on.  One is more laid back, out going and social.  The other, as a baby, hated to change anything and need much more adjustments to any changes.   She's also very sensitive to some things and a bit more shy than her sister.  It is very interesting to note these personality differences in them since genetically, they have the exact same DNA.    Just as every pregnancy was different, every baby was different.  Some were quiet, happy and quite content unless hungry or wet.  And others were just fussy about most everything or seemed to have more sensitivity to stimuli and changing or bathing.  I sure enjoyed raising them and seeing each develop their own personality!    I would say that some of the things that were different have remained over the years.  Some have been less, like my younger twin's reactions to changes and going places.  When she was  a toddler, she just hated to be moved or having to go anywhere and would fuss a lot.  She's ten now and has, thankfully, out grown this reticence to move on to new activities.  She's also overcome a great deal of her shyness, and now loves to perform in front of a crowd!      What is really fun for moms is the way we can just have more and more love for each baby as they come into our lives.  We know each is a special, new person in their own rite and we appreciate those differences.  I sure do, with my twins!  My youngest daughter, who is four now, looks very similar to my oldest daughter, who is 21 now.  And after I had her, I was thankful to have another sweet little girls to care for and felt it was like coming full circle in my life.  I had raised my oldest until she was 10 and lost custody of her and now have little contact with her.  So, I was truely blessed with my youngest!    Well, good luck with your report and hope this helps you.  Please feel free to message me if you need any more info.  R

DPegPYRPaa	Yes and you should take them in to make sure that is what it is.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	A newborn can get thrush - it's quite common for them to get it in their mouths. So yes, anyone can regardless of age.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	anyone with a mucous membrane can get a yeast infection (aka thrush).  inform the pediatrician.|`|SBJNJEBBaa	yes my duaghter had it! very contagious|`|H7MSxgZ7aa	yup|`|DNCmoJsiaa	First off are you sure it is thrush?  Is it clinically diagnosed as thrush.  White sploches on the back of the tounge can be just a bacteria buildup.  Thrush bleeds when brushed away.  It kind of looks like cottage cheese.    Young children especially newborns are more suscitable to diseases such as thrush.  Although a 2 year olds immune system should be adequeate enough to ward off thrush, I would speculate that if the child was battling some other disease (flu, cold etc), and his/her immune system was already supressed, that thrush would be possible.  Although I am not a doctor, and this is just my educated opinion.

SEzIkGNiaa	Unfortunatly for the 11 year old, those are basicaly the only things you can do.  For the 15 year old, you could work at some fast food restaurants.  I know that A&W hires at 14.    *Babysitting  *Paper Route  *Dog sitting/walking  *Bus Boy (14+)  *Cleaning houses|`|0VJE7BXmaa	Fast food restaurants will hire you starting at age 14.

Unfortunately I was pushed to be a responsible adult at a young age and it's bit depressing because i'm going to have to be that way for the rest of my life. Stay a kid as long as you can let financial responsibility elude you for a while.  BUT if you are desperate paper route and babysitting is about it. Babysitting was something i did when i was under 16|`|ZdeJCdCbaa	I would go around your neighborhood and ask if people need help cleaning windows, picking up their yard, mowing lawns. especially the elderly. but make sure your parents know where you are and how you are working for. As for the 15 year old...i would start at fast food places. That's where i got my first job when i was 15. you can only work so many hours per week but it helps!|`|2xS1Jro7aa	The 11 year old could try selling some stuff on craigslist? The 15 year old you could get a job at McDonald's, paper rout, most restaurants, roller rink, bowling alley, places like that! Find something fun!

61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	I find it interesting that the son's mom often talks about how perfect their son is, but not perfect enough to pick a decent woman.  You raised your son - either you think you did a good job and you need to let him live his own life, or you think you screwed up and you still need to let him live his own life.  No one "ruined" your son, your son is allowing all of this to happen.      Anywho, look at it from your DIL's perspective - she has known her own mother her whole life - she's probably going to trust her with her baby more than someone she has only known for 3 years, and who she can't get to know as well as her own mom because you didn't raise her.  It's very hard to trust someone you don't know with your child, especially when it's your first.  You may have said or done things that she doesn't want being done with her daughter that you don't even realize and that may be making her more uncomfortable.  My MIL and I got along great until my daughter came along.  I wouldn't let her take my daughter because of things she has said like "She should be getting formula" (she's breastfed) or "You shouldn't pick her up all the time or you'll spoil her" - those things lead me to believe that she will not care for my daughter the way I want her to be cared for.  And just as you feel you deserve some respect, she also deserves some respect - which you obviously don't give her if you feel she is "ruining" you son.  The point is, you have to give respect to get it, and the bottom line is that this is her and your son's child, not yours.  You have to play by her rules.  If you think that your granddaughter would be better off without the constant mistrust, then be an adult and go out of your way to get rid of it. Saying "it's not fair" isn't going to change anything.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	My suggestion is to take accountability for your part.  The alienation is because you are causing friction.  It doesn't matter if its her fault too or more her fault or mostly that doesn't matter.  What matters is that you need a big slice of humble pie quickly and stop feeling like you are the disrespected elder otherwise you may altogether lose your relationship with your son and granddaughter.  Like it or not this woman is your granddaughter's mother and you need to keep her happy so you can maintain decent relationships with your son and granddaughter.      Your son is an adult, this is his choice, all you can do is support him and no matter what happens do not talk badly about your son's girlfriend.    My mother in law tried to run my husband and my life, now she is no longer in our life.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Honestly, you should've told her you took her. Think about things from her point of view. I don't see how she is ruining your son, other than the fact that you two can't seem to get along. Which you both need to suck it up because that baby doesn't deserve to be the at center of this argument.|`|7scxfyABaa	i see where you are coming from, but technically SHE is the mother, you aren't|`|eeGN977eaa	Wow that it tough. I got really mad at my MIL once because she took my children (her grandchildren) for a ride but it was in the front seat of her truck, no seat belts, and my youngest on her lap! But I think that is probably a whole lot different than what you did. Have you tried talking to you son and DIL together? Try sitting down as a group and talking about it because the DIL may be playing your son against you and it will be hard to do that if you are all present. It shouldn't start as a confrontation but rather a talk to help things get better.    Good luck to you!|`|eRVRWwkBaa	Step back. Don't say anything anymore...it will be hard but believe me sometimes 'silence is golden'. She is your son's wife and you have to remember that. He loves her and you have to show him respect. I know you love your granddaughter but ask your son if for the mean time if he and your granddaughter can visit once a week or set up dates to spend time together. Tell him it would be more comfortable for you and less stressful for everyone and that you don't want him and baby caught in the middle.  There is no point in arguing and name calling and such. Why, don't you make new friends or volunteer somewhere where you can be a sub-grandmother or work with kids. Don't waste your energy. It only causes headaches,anger and a waste of time that could have been better spent. Believe me. We had a similar situation with one of my brothers and then we just let them be saying NOTHING at all. After 2 years of letting things alone he came went to his mom and said he couldn't  take the lies,verbal abuse and disrespect.He now has custody of his daughter and no more stress. Take care & Good Luck.|`|jh9iPYvXaa	If I understand correctly, you took your granddaughter for a ride at a time when your DIL already knew she was with you? To me, this sounds like a disturbed woman. Unfortunately, you have to work this out through your son, not your DIL. He needs to stand up for you, or you won't have a relationship with this girl.    And as badly as she's treating you, she may be treating him just as badly. Check into "Borderline Personality Disorder" - this sounds all too familiar.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	As the mother-in-law and the elder, you need to suck it up and act like the bigger person. Be a role model for the woman, do as she asks when you're sitting for the baby, and forget what the other grandmother is or is not allowed to do. Don't butt heads with the girl and don't even discuss her behavior with your son as that's the quickest way I know of to alienate a grown child. Neither one of you are completely innocent in creating this mess, but your age and wisdom should count for something, maybe not right now, but used correctly, it will in a few years. Don't just give up on being around the baby, but do set a better example for everyone concerned and ignore as much of her mother's irritating behavior as you possibly can.|`|n1vKoto7aa	This is not going to be the answer you want to hear, but your son is 26 years old. He makes his own decisions now. It seems pretty clear that he's chosen to be with this girl, no matter how much you may dislike her, or she you. I'm truly sorry it's causing you so much anguish. She seems determined to not get along with you (and maybe vice versa?) You can ask your son to be mediator, but you can't expect him to choose you over her. As far as your granddaughter's other grandma, women are naturally going to feel more comfortable with their own mother. I know it hurts, but jealousy won't help. The only advice I can offer you is to try and fight fire with kindness: be the bigger person in this and maybe your daughter-in-law-to-be will come around, even if only a little bit. Grandchildren are wonderful "gap-bridgers". Just make it politely clear how important it is for you to be a part of your granddaughter's life and hope that your son and his fiance respect that like the mature adults they are.|`|gNriZVv9aa	Yes, you should have asked her if it was okay. She's a new mother, and a first time mom. So she is going to be very protective of her baby. Think back to when you had your first child. I'm sure you may have had your times too. She is going through a huge change in her life. So you have to expect her to be on guard. However, she needs to do her part into creating a good relationship with you, as well. I think you two need to spend some time together. When you do, bring up the fact that you seem to think that you always come back to fighting or butting heads. Taking that point out in the open is a big step in patching a relationship. Things will work out for the best. Just do what you can. =) Hope this helped.|`|Bzb6rSeCaa	Im not sure what you should do in this situation, it sounds like you really want to be a part of your grandchild's life, the reason she would let her mother take her daughter everywhere and not you is probably because it is HER mother and she has known her her whole life and trusts her but you she has only know for a few years. Im not saying its right or wrong or even fair, I just think its how some people work.    Im sort of at the other end of what could be a similar situation, I have been married 2 &1/2 years and my mother in law wants grandchildren bad!! We don't have any kids yet and this really upsets her, it has come to the point where I don't want to visit her anymore because she gets so obsessed with the whole grandchildren thing and usually ends up in tears. Now im hearing things like that she thinks im going to treat her like a second rate grandmother and that Im going to let my mum see the baby more then her and that I will tell her to go away if she comes to visit when I have a baby. This really annoys me, considering she is already accusing me of things that haven't even happened yet, I don't have kids and im not even pregnant!! And i told my husband of course im going to call my mum for help before her because she is MY mum and lives 5 mins down the road, his mum is 30 mins!!  Sorry about the rant, I dont know if your sistualtion is similar to mine but this kind of gives you a different way of looking at it I hope.   Good luck with it all!!|`|DPegPYRPaa	I would talk to her and you son about it. Nothing gets solved when you keep it in. Just don't be rude and start a fight. Let them know you feel like this.|`|287be9eed813282b97683e4edde034f8aa	I have been in your exact situation.  I looked into "borderline personality disorders".  Try it, I bet you will be shocked at what you read.    I know how much it hurts to be treated like a second class grandma.  Especially when the wife's mother can do no wrong.  I don't understand what makes us any less of a mom because we gave birth to boys.  All we want is to be a "part" of the family.  Of course their family unit comes first but the son's parents and family should be treated as equally as the wife's family.      I couldn't agree with you more about respect.  I would of never, ever treated my mother-in-law with a lack of disrespect no matter how I felt about her.  I might of kept my distance, but yes her being the elder, I would of never disrespected!  Maybe it is the way we are brought up and I see more and more of disrespect with the younger generation.  By the way, I am not exactly old, I am 50.    I know my son told me he would always love me no matter what and he knew I would be there for him unconditionally.  It was  easier to give into his wife.  Well he finally had enough and sought counseling.  At a point we all went.   He felt divorce was not an option and he had made his bed and he had to lie in it.      Here is what I did.  I continued to treat my daughter-in-law as my own.  Yes, it was difficult to say the least.  I continued to have a close relationship with my son.  I continued to dote on my granddaughter as much as I was able.  Do not let the lines of communication die between you and your son.  Take every moment you have with your granddaughter and make it the best.  Also I would suggest counseling it helped us a lot!    It took a  year but she finally came around.  We now enjoy a very good relationship.  I think she realized I was not competition but an extension of family and had much to offer her.  My son is happy too.    You can see by the attitude and answers by so many poster that they can not possibly see how it is the problem of the daughter-in-law, it just has to be the mother-in-law.  Ahhhhh perfection.  I know first had this problem exisits, I just hope you have the happy ending I did.|`|qmLjEXlDaa	I would have a sit down with your son and daughter in law.  I would state your case and focus on your goal  (seeing your grand daughter)  Find out what they expect from you with out being defensive.      All this fighting and tension is not good for this child to see.  Do yourself a favor do not compare your self to her mother at that is not going to help.  Let them know you are not trying to over step your boundaries.    Good Luck|`|AA11610054	A couple of points.    1. She is correct.  You do not have a right to do anything with your granddaughter without her or your son's permission.  She is her mother.  How would you have liked it if your mother-in-law took one of your 3 sons somewhere against your wishes when they were 8 months old?    2.  Age does not automatically grant respect.  Just because you are her 'elder', does not mean you deserve any respect that you haven't earned.  My niece is 22 years old, but I give her more respect than many people I work with.  This is because she is intelligent, hard working, and mature.    3.  I have an 8 month old son, and guess what, I don't go and visit my family as much anymore either.  As a mother of 3, do you not remember the time constraints that an infant places on you?    If you want to gain her respect, trust, and access to your granddaughter, you need to convince yourself of one thing.  She is her mother.  Respect that fact, and the respect will be given back.  Ask her permission for anything out of the ordinary.      And as the mother of 3 sons, know this.  Sons are programmed to leave the nest and venture out on their own.  Daughters are more inclined to remain with the family.  Your son is 26, and will have his own life.  Stay caring, stay loving, and don't be possessive.  He'll always be there.  But right now, he's caring for his own family, and you should be proud of that.
OFaZ9SSDaa	I have read them before, but not in a while. I was quite shocked at some of the questions (and answers) that I read. Some of the questions were obviously from adolescents and I felt compelled to advise them on their particular situation. And I can remember one question that was from a parent that just PISSED me off!! It was a dad and he was completely insulting his teenage (13 I think) son because he was not into girls yet. The dad was worried because the kid just wanted to play video games and hang out with his friends. This dad was even going so far as to show his son porn....13 years old!!!  I gave that **cker a piece of my mind...but I am pretty sure the question was deleted shortly after because I couldn't find it after that.    Shocking...really shocking. Parents are the first line of defense against the world out there and we need to be as open and as honest with our kids when they get to that age. Mine are only 4 and 1 right now....but I hope that I can speak freely (words chosen appropriately for the age) to them when they get to be teenagers.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	I get more out of the pregnancy section.  The number of girls who don't know what to do when their period is late or they think they're pregnant right after they've had sex and think they feel the baby.  I'll have to start going to the adolescent section too.      Sometimes my 8 year old will ask the Google tool bar a question...lol|`|NZKiSfVOaa	tbf, im 14 and one, we need a place where we can ask people who cant really judge or who you dont know if you want a none biased opinion.  and where i go to school we didnt get sex ed, we just had to watch a video about puberty, when this boy kissed his poster of a porn star and the girl got hairy and that was it so forgive me please you over acting hardcores. and plus people arent the same so you cant be sure that all kids turn out like what people post on these things.  So all in all im sorry if we need a non biased opinnion about important things in life.    also how is the adolescent section for adults mate?|`|AjqO1aJgaa	All the time - after all, I'm parenting an adolescent right now!

You need to be educated before you act.     When I am a mother, I'm going to talk to my kids about everything and make sure they know I won't be very mad before getting the details.

They just released a article about the THOUSANDS of predators they have pulled off of myspace. Meeting people online is just asking for it if you are young. Once your older you have better judgment. So to answer the question I think it's a bad thing for teens to be on dating sites. Heck, I think it's bad thing for them to talk to strangers online AT ALL!
F6lZHRkVaa	In my experience, the more higher your position the less likely you are to take sick days. Whether that's good or bad, I don't know. I don't think these people are even saving their sick days for when their kids are sick. I've had many a boss who was a CEO or Vice Pres and they came in to work every single day no matter what. These of course are the same bosses who don't understand when their underlings take a day off to care for their sick children.    Here in Minnesota though, there are a lot of large companies that cater to working parents. Target Headquarters is a great example, it's very easy to take off to care for children there. They even have special cozy rooms set up for mothers to pump. So not all companies are created equal, basically.|`|SZdT1r8saa	I TOTALLY relate to this.  I would say, if your kid isn't contagious, take them to school.  They probably got sick from school anyhow. Save your days for when they are really sick.|`|3b042baeb993c8dc0d7c7bc9bc4817f2aa	Both are bad, but to send a sick child in and expect them to function is worse.  A child should be protected...and an adult is better at keeping their germs to themselves than a child is.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Daycare won't take a sick kid regardless. So I'd save my sick days for my kids if it was me too but I'm a SAHM. My sister's son has asthma and she has to save her days for her son. Unless she's there and they send her home because she's sick she really won't go home. And she has been to work several times so sick that they have sent her home. She doesn't trust anyone else to care for him because when he gets coughs or runny nose it is much worse than anyone else having a cold because of the asthma.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	Day care can be really strict about illness, so sometimes I have no choice but to stay home with a sick child. Yes I have sent my older kids to school sick...not really sick,  but with runny noses or a bit of a cough. Sounds horrible but I only have 5 sick days a year so I have to use them very wisely.  Too many companies and work places are not very family friendly :(|`|oM6Pem1Waa	w.e oh wait is this the right qustion?|`|TQW5E6olaa	I think it's worse to take a sick child to daycare, than to go to work sick. Adult can wash their hands and cover their mouths, young children cannot effectively do so.    When I worked at the studio it was a nightmare anytime my daughter was sick because they would hold it against me, like I could control it. And I only had 10 days. Kids in daycare get sick more than 10 days a year...Plus if I had to go in and she couldn't go to daycare I'd have to pay $90 for her to be watched at a hospital sick kid program, on top of what I still had to pay daycare.    There should be more parent friendly companies with work from home options or flex hours if possible...
ySWSXrLwaa	I would give him more time. Read to him everyday and go over flash cards. He will start saying new words. Have you had his hearing checked?  It sounds like he is doing good. As long as he can follow directions I think he is fine. Write down all the words that he can say. He might be able to say more words than you think. Talk to him as much as you can through out the day and encourage him to tell you what he wants.|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	My little sister did the same thing. My mom thought there was something wrong with her. But in reality she just didn't want to talk! Then one day me and my mom were sitting on the couch and my little sister walks up to us and she goes 'mama, my bunghole hurts!" We have no idea where she heard the word 'bunghole' either! But it sure was funny!  And ever since then she has been talking. Just give him time and don't stress.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	have him evaluated by early intervention. I think it sounds like he has some sort of speech delay. My son was considered to be a full 12 months behind in his expressive speech when he said 10 words at 27 months old. With therapy he was speaking in 2-4 word sentences by 2.5 years old and is now age appropriate at 3 years old. I did not ahve to pay for any of his therapy|`|sw2R5A9iaa	sounds normal -how concerned is the pediatrician?|`|DPegPYRPaa	My daughter is the same age and she talks up a storm. She will tell you how she feels, if she is hurt, hungry, what she wants etc. She knows songs and everything. She also can do most of the ABC's and count by herself up to 10 or so. If you are concerned talk to his doctor.|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	just give it time. he will catch up|`|AA11362517	Just get him checked out by a specialist. You can even put him to speech therapy now.|`|noeHjzyCaa	My son who is the same age he talks like an adult i can have a conversation with him. Maybe you should Take him to see his pediatrician. Ten words he can speak doesn't seem right to me.|`|BRBPDBvIaa	my son did the same thing.  Then all of sudden out of the blue, within a week, he just started talking more and more everyday.  So it's all a matter of when he's ready.
UVQrNF3daa	I would just send him a text saying Hey whats going on?  Or Whats up? Sorry i didnt text this morning i was in class.. Just start it simple and let him respond and that should get it going...|`|wzXJOSIeaa	If you're not boring then just be yourself. Start off by hey guess who? That would be cute if you ask be. After that just be yourself and it will all flow together. If he doesn't like you for who you are then you don't want him anyway.
LiPoEBenaa	My baby weighed 5lb 4 oz at 34 weeks    I've also gained close to 35lbs  Good luck and congrats on your little one!|`|PYySLOw6aa	this sounds about right all babys are different but I am thinking any where from 4 to 6 pounds would be normal|`|QD3jh9OEaa	about 4-5 lbs maybe a little less or more depends on a lot of different things....All people are different i had my first baby at 34 weeks and she weighed 4lbs 2 oz. My sister in-law had her baby at 34 weeks and she weighed 6 lbs 13 oz..|`|7yd7lNU7aa	5 lbs and i gained 25lbs.   sounds normal to me!|`|AA10478146	My baby was less than 4 lbs at that time but, my baby is VERY small.  I would say 5, 11 sounds good.  If you ask your doc. she call tell you what percentile your baby falls under.  I would guess around the 50th.    I am not, nor have I ever been, a smoker.
c5186eac9c2b70e449f12d24a1aaec90aa	honey you are three years old I'm not putting a diaper on you. I thought you wanted to be a big girl with big girl panties? If you need to use the potty I'll go with you. Would you like me to go with you to the potty?   My three year old asks this everyother day since the new baby came. Also I watch a three year old boy who is still in diapers so she wants one. Usually this works and she goes on with her day. Some days I say all that or some version and it doesn't work so I just ignore it. No way are we back tracking now. She's even staying dry through the nights. J can't afford diapers for two!!|`|DPegPYRPaa	No I am sorry but you wear Big Girl underwear now, remember? (And then I would show her the underwear she is wearing as a reminder)|`|2757cc8c9c9fb444a2952ea0aa7f9fa6aa	that would be kind of if i had a child would was stupid potty trained ask for a diaper. sure honey why not you can have a diaper when you poop or pee but not a bedtime. or the day unless you need to.|`|e9GHgtc4aa	buzz off kid ,I have one left and I need it for myself.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	"No, diapers are for babies"|`|bELqEsdOaa	I would have to agree with, "We're all out of them". Kids believe that usually.|`|DKqsFGymaa	"We're all out of diapers."

Good luck.|`|Hbfc8TIpaa	ummmm you crazy|`|oXXFo2ATaa	you're not crazy,   the trick that said you were is just dumb.|`|4Yw20J6Saa	There is no method. You have a 50/50 chance every pregnancy of having a girl. Although I believe I heard in biology class in high school that the chances of having a girl are higher because all mammals start out as female in the womb and something changes along the way. That is why males have nipples, because they started out female.|`|7yd7lNU7aa	It has to do with the male's acidity.

0bZ6j0aSaa	My favourite is Abbie, I just like the way it looks and it flows really well when you are writing it.      Abby is okay but it just doesn't look right to me.    I would avoid Abbey is it puts me in mind of churches/convents/monks etc!    Also, I'd avoid the 'trendy' spellings like Abi, Aby, Abbi, Abbe etc, Abigail (and Abbie) is such a beautiful name and i honestly think these sorts of spellings just cheapen it!    Good luck!|`|3MVv1uOaaa	thats my sisters name! and she goes by Abby too.   I'd probably spell it like my sister does. I think it looks best|`|CMuL7XpKaa	I like Abby (i know an Abby, and 2 Abbey s)|`|48c930ebdc8dc579c849fcf4023c3659aa	I like Abbi. I think its cute!|`|pdtAmIPyaa	abbey-looks more exotic in my opinion|`|35JIECGRaa	Abby    Short, sweet, and reminds me of " The Amazing Days of Abby Hayes" by Anne Mazer, and also a character from "The Baby-Sitter's Club" by Ann M Martin. :)|`|R1cey1Evaa	Really like the name Abigail, I like Abby, but you could try:  Abbe  Abbi (fits her name spelling)  Abbiee|`|QCIQP3Kbaa	Definitely Abby.|`|dVJOF4Bhaa	I like it like Abbie.|`|d7b6cfff12112f1cc7529b075ffe97c6aa	Abbie is my favorite.   Abby is nice as well.  Abbey looks too long- I don't like this one.    Abi is also an option, but this one looks too short and is probably one of the less common ones.    I adore the name Abigail/Abbie, by the way.   Great choice!|`|b4IK780Raa	Answer-    Abby    Other Suggestions-    Abbee|`|MHmHrC0Naa	Abby, it's simpler!|`|sEr58mAVaa	I like Abbie. It sounds more intellectual.|`|e12a1f2ed505be8021ede0df33b7238faa	Abby, that's how everyone else will spell it.  You might as well save her the conversation she'll have to repeat her whole life to correct people when they misspell it.|`|4tHeJlU2aa	Abby but doesnt matter|`|mKua0NjIaa	def Abbie some much cuter..  Abbi can be different as well|`|Pz8rIt26aa	Abigael is a pretty way to spell it too.    As for the nickname, Abbie or Abby.|`|KtjzRptMaa	I would want my daughter to have Abby, because (for me) it is a common name.  I think people are getting too complicated over a name... so make it simple!  Good Luck!|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	Abbie is my favorite.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I'd spell it Abi as it fits better with how her full name is spelt.    I'll quote you someone's ebay signature on your third option:  "Please do not call me Abbey. I am not a kind of church."|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Abbie is best in my opinion.    Abby/Abbey reminds me of the religious word.    I've also saw Abi as a shortened version of Abigail.    Great name choice by the way!
PCsW0gbPaa	As long as she could choose where she wanted it and the design she wanted, I don't see any problem with that.|`|DPegPYRPaa	Why would you let your 10 year old get a tattoo?  That is way to young! Yes I see that as being unfit.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	yep|`|2xS1Jro7aa	You posted this question before im confused are you just asking questions to ask them?????|`|8nNF3t65aa	That's just appalling. There's many risks involved in getting a permanent tattoo at any age: the needle could be infected, for one. And a typical 10-year-old wouldn't have a fully developed sense of self yet; that kind of decision can't be hers to make yet. Chances are she's going to want the tattoo removed someday.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	A legitimate tattoo parlor would not tat a 10-year old, even with parent's permission. It's probably an illegal setup and the mother should be punished for taking her kid to an illegal shop.|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	you are kidding right? unfit mother probably unsafe mother yes|`|JnLoHaoAaa	That's poor judgement right there on the mother's behalf|`|ylgNuE3uaa	Letting a 10 year old decide anything that is LIFELONG is a mistake.  Unfit mama: Probably yes, BUT it is definitely poor judgement.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Legally that mother did nothing wrong by letting her child get a tattoo.  If you look at it from a moral standpoint, some people might say that was wrong.  But legally she is not an unfit parent.|`|wipJ9OE7aa	So, she must be one of those parents who's trying to be her child's friend... I just hate that... She probably also says that she wants her daughter to be able to make her own choices.. I hate that too... This is the type of parenting that just makes me sick. No limits, no boundaries, poor judgment, it's just stupid. So, I guess her daughter is really the mother.|`|PYSMK0JBaa	I believe that would qualify as being an "unfit" mother. Allowing a 10 year old to make a decision like that is baffling. That is why there are laws prohibiting it.|`|2jMFurDoaa	i didnt even think that was legal.  i mean theres an age limit even when the parent is consenting.    that would for sure qualify as an unfit mother. why would a 10 year old need a tattoo?|`|gurR7Dhtaa	I'm going to say this-I am currently 26 and have two tatoos. Both of which I got before I had my child and one I got when I was 15 in Mexico. And the other at 19. At the age of 15 I had no idea where my life would and the same with 19. Now that I am 26 I can 10000000000% say with ALL certainty, I would have chose diff. if I would have waited. In the design and the location.     I think what makes us good parents is realizing our children are young and there minds are NOT fully developed. Stepping in and say NO may seem to hurt the childs feeling but it will be good for them in the long run. I can say from personal experience, I want the best future for my child and all though we appreciate every day for itself and never know if we'll have tomorrow, his future is of utmost importance. I would consider myself unfit to even think of allowing him at 10 to get a tatoo. I would KNOW MYSELF to be UNFIT for even considering it.
mppKv11Eaa	They grow out of it eventually. I did. It's just her ears, not her clitoris, tongue or her belly button, so it's fine. Plus, she's only three years away from being a teenager, so why not get a head start on the weird clothes and what-not, eh?|`|jdRKZe18aa	My daughters were not allowed to pierce anything but ONE ear hole  while they were minors and in my house!  When they turn 18 and want to mutilate their bodies that will be their choice - but age 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!you've got to be kidding.... they aren't old enough, wise enough or mature enough to recognize the long term consequences of putting THAT MANY permanent holes in themselves! I think that is TERRIBLE.  THAT is why children have ADULT PARENTS to guide, direct, teach and say NO SOMETIMES!|`|gwUMipsUaa	She can get them when she can pay for them herself and doesn't need your permission to do it.  She can wait until she's 18.    My mom didn't allow them before I was 18.  I actually got mine pierced at nineteen, and soon got tired of messing with earrings and let them grow together.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I would let her if she already has some. But I will say she might not like it in a couple of years so I would talk to her about it and make her want it for about 6 months before doing it|`|cFPQVavVaa	i don't think  that is very appropriate for a girl her age to have six ear piercings. i think that just looks very trashy.|`|UZKg2odzaa	six timeessss??   and shes ten??  ha uh that sounds a little too high school. But every new generation grows up faster and faster.. haha  btw i'm 19|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	No. I wouldn't.  I'd allow her to have ONE set of ear piercing (the normal kind).  But she'd have to be 18 to get the other ones and she'd have to do it on her own (in other words, I wouldn't fund it).|`|OUhd54Zaaa	she dosnt want any piercings or tattoos...yet.    Id allow her to get them done one new set per birthday. So, if she has them pierced now, id let her get the second done, and on her 11th birthday, the third, etc.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	She's 10 who's to say she won't want more in a year or so. I think 6 is a bit much maybe 2 per ear but not six. That overkill in my opinion.|`|dR4QN0gHaa	My personal opinion is that at 10 years old a girls should have one ear piercing. She is much too young for six. Friends obviously don't care and the teachers may object but not say anything because it isn't their place.|`|2HbnKuffaa	As long as either the mother or daughter is responsible enough to keep them clean, then I don't see what the problem is. Piercings can always be taken out.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	if you're ok with it then i see nothing wrong with it.|`|AA11962417	Are you the mother second guessing yourself or do you want to get some support because you are about to go criticize someone else's parenting? Either way, let it go. But for future reference, I would say no to any piercing for any child...let them be kids as long as possible.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	If she is wearing respectible earings and acting respectable, then sure, why not.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	I would allow it if she were my daughter. It's just ear piercings. As long as the piercings were small (like, no plugs or industrial bars or any of that) I don't see a problem with it at all.|`|QmoyBAd3aa	i think thats fine
eeGN977eaa	No but I have seen a lot of "you obviously have no kids" and "I doubt you are a mother" and stuff like that.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Yes, on this very website.|`|s6emVQleaa	Nope, can't say that I have.|`|AA11210211	umm I don't think so??At least I don't remember any.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Being a parent is more than just giving birth. You need to look after, care for, comfort, educate and actually have an active role in a child's life to be a parent.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Nope i have not.
RPszYGXkaa	I am 5 days away from AF, and I too started testing (wish I was stronger, but I have no patience!!).  I got BFN's too.  It is still too early, and I should know b/c when I was pregnant with my daughter my BFP didn't come until I was two days late...  I know my breasts were tender from 2 DPO up to today (9DPO), now they are normal (sigh), don't know if that is a sign or not.  But anyway, if you are anything like me, I tend to analyze every twinge and somehow make it into a symptom....so I try not to count on them, my mind will play tricks on me lol.  I know when I was pregnant with my daughter, I tested early, got a BFN and beleived it.  I really felt nothing unusual (normal pre AF symtpoms) until the day I should have had AF...that day I got very tired (in bed at 8pm, normally up to at least midnight).    Best wishes and I hope you get your BFP!!!!|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	I would wait a couple of days and then take another test also take it in the morning. You can get best results with that, Good luck|`|winmjHAmaa	As agonizing as it is,  I think you should wait a couple more days and test again.  Did you take a first response test?  They are accurate and can tell you sooner.  I am in my 2ww, waiting for Feb 15.  I am going insane!!! Lots and lots of baby dust to you!!!
9955049b1cf14ffa87b51ced7a9714abaa	you might have to go to the doctors office to do a blood test. good luck.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	28 days after jan 4th you can test and get an accurate result. So if you were pregnant you would have had a positive result, but I've heard of people getting a false negative. Their body produces HcG at a slower rate.     Personally, I got a positive result before I missed my period.
Ef5gadRQaa	There could be several reasons: you could have a infection, it could be pressure on your pelvic floor muscles and they are weak (it affects front back or middle of your pelvis), or it could be a sign that things are changing hormonally.

I think I may have lost mine (completely) last week and my doctor just shrugged and said it could regenerate.  The main thing to look for is contractions, and 'bloody show' to indicate labor.

My ex-husband and I lived with his dad and step mom and it was HORRIBLE! She never had kids, but thought it was OK to tell me how to raise mine. It got to the point where I told her to go straight to hell. That is something I would normally not say to someone, but she just kept on and on. If you don't want to end up having hard feelings, you need to get out of that situation. It will only get worse when you actually have your baby! Good luck to you and your husband with your new baby.|`|f151425981f43cdb1a033fb56225a5afaa	That's what usually happens when 2 adults stay together.

He would be a much better room mate and then your little sister wouldnt have to go to the wacko ladys house to see you. Because she told me that it sucks that she never gets to see you and she feels bad that your stuck there and wishes she could help but only being 14 theres not much she can do. well thats all, just find a way to get out.    xoxo super cool person you dont know  :)|`|6735054466727aaa52bcd78fe026b538aa	Ok I'm 13 weeks pregnant and my husband drives me crazy and he doesn't even do anything wrong. If I had some lady that's not even "family" telling me that I was not to get an epidural I would have to stop it at that and tell her that you are very grateful for her hospitality but she's not the one having the baby. Does she have kids? Did she have an epidural? I also understand the money-tightness, and being tired. From the way you put it she has never had kids and has no room to tell you how to have yours!!! And where did your dad move to? Can't you move in with him? After the baby of course. Moving now would not be wise.
54e9210059338301bf2f8120f8f1c54aaa	Hi, well i will be totally honest with you, when anyone gets off birth control for a while and starts it back up it is very easy to get pregnant,  That is the easiest time to get pregnant actually, I was told this by my OBGYN because that is when i got pregnant for my son.  Having sex that same day adds to the posibility but i am not a doctor myself but i have been told this like i said,, If you are then i believe it is a blessing and not to worry!!  Good luck either way!!|`|AA12380526	5,720 to 1|`|a0125c2fc1a81d8b4e3e37d40cfb58deaa	75%|`|dfa477700b5f0f6c751fc01fcdccb997aa	your best bet is to take a pregnancy test and find out for sure. if it's been more than 2 weeks/14 days, you can do a blood pregnancy test at your doctor's office or any women's health care facility. depending on your personal views of women's facilities, i would beware for those that are politically driven. if it hase been more than 28 days since the first day of your last period, you can do a urine pregnancy test that you can purchase over the counter at a drug store.
45nSn7Rcaa	yes, when you take the diaper off the baby you fold down the front onto the back of it.  Fold it again, then roll it tight into itself from one side...you can then secure the tape from the last side and keep it tighly rolled.|`|7scxfyABaa	just roll them up like you usually do before you throw them in the genie|`|iyL6dyMyaa	Just roll the diaper up real snug and throw it in there and screw.  That diaper genie can hold quite a bit.
AA10168687	My 1st Dr was a dink too.  Anytime I told him a concern he just acted like I was a stupid pregnant lady.  Of course I knew nothing, this was my 1st!  He also kept calling my fat the entire time, telling my 'don't eat all the leftovers!'  OMG!!  That actually just made it worse, because I felt if I eat healthy he was getting his way.  Stupid, I know but I just didn't want to listen to him!!  I gained like 50 lbs!  I also was told form past patients of his that he is very impatient and yelled at the moms and if you are in labor for a long time, he will just do a Cesarean to get it over with.  I was SO SCARED of this!  Thank God he was out of town when I went into labor and I had a very patient Dr.  I pushed for a long time, so I felt very lucky!    Now with my 2nd I have a very nice Dr.  I am eating healthy and I can call her with any concerns.  My advice to anyone with a bad Dr. like that is to switch.  I don't care how far along you are.  Do you want that man there when you are giving birth??|`|AA11254542	Well, you go ahead and vent.  But as you vent, get into the phone book and look for another ob, please.  You have one that is not concerned with you as an individual and is treating you like a statistic. This one is not the one for you.  This one is potentially dangerous for you.  Can't you just look for another?  Get out now, believe me.    I have so many horror stories about ob's that I couldn't begin to list the stories.  One however, I feel compelled to outline really quick here however.    I was pg and went to a wonderful ob.  He had taken in a new partner whom I never saw, until the day of my c-section.  My doctor told me he was leaving that day, in fact, after the section, out of town as his son was graduating med school.  So, after the section, I was left with his "associate".  Okay, I was feeling terrific after the surgery, happy and actually hoping to be released early the next day.  After about seven hours, my abdoman became distended, bloated beyond belief, I was throwing up bile in the sink, I was so damned sick I can't begin to tell you.  They brough my child in and I asked please take her away, for I was then too sick to care for her and didn't want to accidently hurt her while dozing on what the "associate" had ordered, HEAVY PAIN PILLS.  Now the nurses called him numerous times and gave him temperature reading and symptoms and the next morning I was really worse.  He walked into my room, and said to me, that I was an "attention" getter, that woman had babies everyday and I was "no different" from them and to "stop the act".  Well, I'm sure ANYONE CAN MAKE THEMSELVES DISTENDED AND THROW UP BILE, RIGHT!!!!    He would not listen to the nurses, "who were they, they weren't doctor's after all," and he wouldn't listen to me nor look into my symptoms.  AT one point he ordered antibiotics, then after a day he cancelled the order, ordered a scan, and other tests, then cancelled them.  It ended up that I had a punctured intestine which occurred at the time of the section, and developed upper abdominal peritonitis and nearly lost my life.  I went through exploratory surgeries, when I got so bad, everyone knew I was dying, and then the big one where they located the point of puncture and began draining the paratonitis from me.  I had a tube stuck into my nose and down to drain the black awful crap from my abdoman or stomache, I had surgeries, I had a blood transfusion, and I was there a month, went home at 100 pounds, just bones and could not care for my family for nearly two years of recovery.  I have had complications due to that whole mess, even to this day and it's 22 years later.      No, run, get away from this know it all quack and find another doctor.  If it's a clinic, find another clinic, refuse to see this person, for your own safety.|`|AA11519759	When you have a OBGYN that has a bad attitude like that the best thing for you to do is to change doctors. I have been with the same OBGYN for 10 years and a couple of weeks ago I had a miscarriage. I went to the hospital that he was affiliated with and sat in the waiting room with blood all over my pants I explained to the intake person what was happening and she told me that other people had more serious problems than I did. So my fiance and I left and went to another hospital and by then the miscarriage was inevitable and after being treated upon my release the nurse came in and said we contacted your doctor and told him what happened and we told him that you should follow up with him in 2 days and he told her that he was not going to see me because I did not go to a hospital that he was affiliated with and to refer me to a different doctor. This is the man that has delivered both of my children and he didn't even want to talk to me on the phone.So I reported him to my insurance company because he isn't suppose to refuse service to a patient unless his life was threatened.And now I see another doctor but I really loved my OBGYN and I couldn't believe that the relationship that I thought we had came to this.|`|10d3c33f15c3309bb77cecd2b13c6b7daa	Oh My Gosh! I had the crappiest OB ever! I really wanted a girl doctor and once i found one i went in. First visit i only seen the nurse. Then as i went every month the visits were super quick and to the point. I never bonded with my dr like i wanted to. So on ultrasound day she said my placenta was lying low. That was all she said. She didn't explain to me that it would grow up the uterine wall or that if it covers the cervix i would have to have a c section. She just left me with no info. Then towards the end, i go into the office and i say...so i was wondering about the epidural and she flipped out on me saying i don't know tiffany i can't tell you what is going to happen we have a lot of time left...and really what i wante dto ask her was if they had a walking epidural i heard about. She had such an attitute it was unbelievable. I was in shock.    Then at 36 weeks i went in and was at 2. I was so excited like it was coming any day and i said so how long do you think. And she was a negitive *** hole who was like well you can stay this way until 40 weeks.    And the same thing went the next week. Attitute.    And she sent me to the hospital at 38 weeks and induced me because i was dialted to 5 and she said ok we aren't gong to give yiou drugs to induce you. We are going to break your water and let you do it on your own. Yeah right thirty min later she said my contractions weren't reg enough and she gave me pictocin. Then she kept kicking it up. Then I was in so much pain i wanted an epiduiral and she checked me and said i was at 9 and it wouldn't matter if i got it anyways. But i said oh well i want it. And then after i got it the nurse checked me and said i was at 7. My dr. lied so i wouldnt get hte drugs. NOW that is a total *****.     Then after she rushed me into the hosptial to have the baby she didn't even deliver it. she let some intern do it and she just sat back and watched!     She was just so rude. And right after baby was born she left. I didn't see her unti lthe next day for a two second check up. She did't even say congradualation or nothing.     I will never go to her agian!!|`|31a3b8017c75bb5d431139c9d64d2340aa	k well first off he works for you so if you want to be seen go in there and demand to be seen. then find a new doc. With my first son i had the same doc from my yearlys.  she was a midwife, cared about me my baby my family and what i wanted.  i got to do the water birth too!! and then to top it all off she came to the hospital when i came in and stayed there (even slept there) threw my 32 hour labor.  and she is my sons peds doc too.  Then i moved away  and i went to the Mayo clinic here in rochester and they were horrible.  They treated me like  a number and didnt answer any of my ?s and had me on pills for a UTI i didnt even have, plus to top it off the doc called in the wrong script so i took 8 too many pills.  So at 29 weeks i decided it was worth the 2 hour drive and went back to my regular doc.  and once again she was amazing... I did the water birth again and she stayed the night with me too good thing she did tho cause i dialated from 4 to 10 and pushed her out in 22 minutes it was crazy.  and now when we go in for our appt. she knows me my bf my two kids and most of my family.  i wish you good luck and go see a new doc please..|`|e1c2e76caed1faa121be3df43abc0d25aa	Hunny...I'd be checking for another ob too!!! I saw a midwife for my last two. This chic was nice at first. She had a lazy eye or something...could look at me and my hubby at the same time. But she started out treating me nicely. Well, with the first she delivered, I spotted all through the pregnancy. This lady actually had the nerve to ask me "What are you putting up there??" OMG!!! Um...the kitchen tongs, the garden hoe, and my husband's power drill....IDIOT!!! LOL!!! I mean, my thought of a reply was funny later on, but she totally was rude. I couldn't reply at all right then. Just shut my mouth and left.    Then she was there when my water broke with the daughter we lost. I was frantic, as I was only 25 weeks, and terrified. She comes in, right in front of my mother, my father in law, my pastor, my husband, and several nurses, and says...I swear word for word she said this...."If you deliver this baby in the next 2 weeks, we'll hand her to you and let her die." And that's just what they did...    I think she should stick to delivering the mail...|`|f6bc5b2d2df9b6239cf5cbd11b513a1baa	some doctors just don't have any bedside manners. trying asking a few friends for their doctors ( i would switch) just get a copy of your file for the new doctor. you should be able to call him for anything, that is what they are being paid for|`|f151425981f43cdb1a033fb56225a5afaa	My ob/gyn when I was pregnant would just come in examine me and then leave. He later introduced me to 2 of his partners in case he wasn't able to make it to deliver my baby that one of his partners would be there. When my baby head was crowning a man I never saw in my life came in and delivered my baby and just left right after he stitch me up. I think that was f**ked up!    Oh by the way my ob/gyn did my son circumcision and cut him too far back to the point my baby kept on bleeding and he had to stay in the hospital for 2 extra day. Now that's real f**ked up.

rv9nDch2aa	I have a doctor's appointment to see if I am pregnant. I took two home test and they both were positive. I thought that I was pregnant when I would feel nausea at night & in the morning. I felt like I had a fever & just felt sick. And my periods are never regular.(I went up to a year without having one.) I  read somewhere that the earlier symptom of "morning sickness" was like 4 or 6 weeks. You are very lucky if you don't get this.   I think the earlier symptoms are nipple soreness, missed period, feeling tired, and want to sleep all the time. Also, if you have a regular bowl movement & now you can't go to the bathroom.And you will have strange dreams about babies. I keep having dreams about having 3 kids. That was just one of the dreams. I really don't know when you can take a test. But I think the test can give you a "real"  answer after 2 weeks. I say wait 2 weeks then try 1 or 2. A friend of mine tried 6 times & they all said positive. I only tried 2 time.   If I am pregnant, which I seriously think that I am, then this will be my first child. If you are pregnant, you may want to see a doctor to confirm it, and you will need to see a doctor next month for a check up. Best wishes!!!|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	The earliest symptom is probably a missed period.

LTD0qL6Yaa	Of course this is perfectly normal and happens to most women. Only a certain amount will be expelled strait after sex and then you go to bed and lay down for 7 or so hours and of course when you stand back up the left over sperm and fluid simply has no where else to go.....but out!!!|`|Fc5RbhqOaa	definately normal, sometimes gross, but normal, I know this sounds rather odd, but baby wipes make for easier clean up.|`|AA10624857	The semen that is ejaculated during sex contains sperm. When the semen enters the vagina, the sperm move fairly quickly out of the seminal fluid through the cervical mucous and moisture a woman produces during sexual arousal. The sperm have one destination in mind and that is to find their way through the cervix and head towards the fallopian tube in search of the egg. After having sexual intercourse, there is always some discharge that is a mixture of the seminal fluid as well as the lubrication that woman has produced. It is normal. It comes out mostly due to simple gravity. The lubrication the woman produces as well as the seminal fluid has to go somewhere and there is only one exit hole for it to go, out the vaginal opening. Urinating after sex helps to clean some of it out, but that is also mostly due to gravity pulling it out when you are sitting down.|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	totally normal ... it happens to me every time!  Plus, most of the sperm swim upwards and what falls out is the seminal fluid which actually protects the sperm.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Its completely normal guys release billions of sperm when they ejaculate.

Good Luck|`|WdvLcYaVaa	Its your period, you're not pregnant. Sometimes you can think about it and obsess over it so much it can mess with your body and cause your period do be different than it normally is. But the fact is, if you are bleeding you are almost definitely not pregnant, especially since you have also had 5 negative tests.
SZdT1r8saa	GO FOR IT!   You'll always find a "good reason" to wait.  And just that you worry about messing up the kids life proves you'll do the best you can.  I promise you'll never regret it!|`|DPegPYRPaa	Are you in a stable situation? Do You own a house? Do you rent? Will you be able to support a child? Will you be getting married? All of these you will also have to factor in. What will be a childs quality of life if you and you bf don't make it? It has only been a year! And you said yourself you have problems with commitment. I don't really think it is a good idea until you can at least answer these questions.|`|P7Bu2I8eaa	Dont have one than!!!!    Best advice ever....|`|iwPGvzskaa	well you dont need to get pregnant if you dont want to. also if you do have a baby you will know what to do so you dont mess the kids life up. every mother knows wats right for their kids and you will too if yuo'll have one|`|kw80YHMLaa	well i think u should wait if your not sure its not fair on your baby. wait till ye are married. babies are hard work at any age believe me|`|fae69ce095d45fe51047ddfec2ace994aa	I felt the same way you do, and now I have a baby. If you don't think you're ready to have kids, then I suggest you don't. You're right about it being a huge commitment. I honestly wish I was married to my boyfriend before we had the baby and we've been together for 3years. And I didn't want to have kids but my boyfriend did.But if you know you wont change your mind then do whats best for you|`|7scxfyABaa	what happens when you break up with your bf because of your commitment phobia?    then you're left to be a single mom (which is totally possible, but not easy)    my advice, tie the knot first, then have the family|`|myEwHgI1aa	Try marriage first, especially if you are "commitment-phobic". A child needs two loving parents that can provide a stable home...and if you can have a happy marriage, what better way to bring a child in? That way they child gets to grow up with both a mommy and a daddy in one home, isn't that what we all really want for our children?   My advice is get married first, and then talk about kids after.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	every women in the world dosent have to have a child so if you don't think it is right for you then don't have children xx|`|gNriZVv9aa	If you aren't sure, then the best thing is probably for you to wait until you are ready. But don't just completely give up on the subject with your boyfriend. Talk about the future and what you expect. Perhaps you two should be married first? That way you know you will never be alone, and he'll be by your side. And then it will also give you time to think things through and find a solid answer within yourself. Having a child is obviously not a one person commitment. And it is a big commitment. You both have to be ready for it. And if you are questioning it, perhaps its just not the time for you. It will call come together sometime or another. =)
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? The chances are slim, you both need to accept the possible consquences, and decide what you would do if it did happen. ??|`|3MVv1uOaaa	probably very low.   i've had sex a fair amount of times and he used to use condoms but now i'm on birth control. i haven't gotten pregnant yet.     although it varies from person to person, but i'd say the chances are low.|`|SpYS7VYoaa	look at the box of condoms, it should have a percantacge there. Go to plannedparenthood.org for the info of how effictive pulling out is(also all methods) Its a great sight and if you go under birht control youll get all the info you need. Heres the direct link!  http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-...|`|z6Vmgw5Waa	Ok, you need to hold the ribbon of the condom before you pull it out, so it wont slip off your penis and into her, though you don't really need to pull out if you're using a condom, if you do it right she'll never get pregnant.
9a3sNrEqaa	you could be! Before I found out i was pregnant i could have sworn I was getting my period and she never showed up! So you might be! Take a test tho!!!|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	you should buy a home pregnancyy test to find out.|`|7EzmV1t8aa	If your already late you can take a test, they are very reliable.  If your having unprotected sex and feeling "funny" you definitely could be pregnant.|`|winmjHAmaa	It is very possible.  The only way to find out for sure is to take a home pregnancy test.|`|SrjdFczaaa	I think you deff have a good chance of being pregnant, This same thing happened to me....I keep having this feeling that i was going to start my period, after 6 days late on my period i couldn't take it anymore i went and bought a home test from cvs I TOOK 3 all saying PREGNANT! i miscarried at 8 weeks, and here i am trying again...SOOO SOMEONE THROW SOME BABY DUST THIS WAY!

Good Luck!!!!|`|cFSpYoDfaa	Sounds like your mucus plug. Call your OB now!|`|82ORY9UFaa	Sounds like your mucus plug at this point of your pregnancy, some women lose a little bit of it during their pregnancy (weeeeeeeks before their labor) and not all at once. If it is, your baby might be heading south.|`|rtFkwelQaa	You are correct.  It is you mucus plug.  You need to keep an eye out if you are leaking any amniotic fluid.  The best way to do that is to wear a pad.  If you have clear leakage you can tell if it's urine or fluid.  If it's fluid there will be a yellow ring around it.  If it's urine it will not.  If you think you are leaking amniotic fluid, you need to call your doctor, even if you aren't having contractions yet.    Blessings

x0INaVNqaa	I think so. If he's paying more attention to you, there must be a reason; and complimenting on your hair (which guys almost never do unless they like a girl) and writing a story about you for class obviously shows he likes you. He may just be really shy because he doesn't think you like him back and he doesn't want to ruin your friendship. Just ask him if he wants to hang out with you sometime (like go to a movie or something), and then build that type of relationship from there on.|`|7IquwRrjaa	hell yea he does gurl he likes u ALOT just give him time u dont wanna go in a rush into a r-ship let him come to u and keep doing swt things 4 u and at the watch hes gonna end up askin u out|`|QfJrdA1Yaa	sounds like a stalker...  kick him in the balls...if you don't want him near you...he may have aids.|`|xVMtfuWPaa	maybe he's noticing you more. yeah he likes you.|`|On2fzgpOaa	Sounds like it. =)
0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	Once you give birth to your baby (whether natural, induced or c-section) you should start to produce milk. Your body senses that the baby isnt in the womb any more, there for it needs to start producing milk.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Same as every one else.  Whether it's natural, induced or c section, you can expect your milk to come in about 3 days after birth.  Some get it earlier, some later, but on average, 3 days.  Once your baby is out of your body and starts suckling on your breast (because you have colostrum from the get go) it stimulates the hormones for milk production.|`|AA10976444	I was induced with my first at 39 weeks.  It took a week for my milk to come in.  With my second I take domperidone to help with milk flow, but I also supplemented with formula to help as it took a week again for my milk, and my child was hungry.|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	I was induced and after wards started to breastfeed my son right away. The actual breast milk came in two days after I delivered without a problem.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Took four days for my milk to come in. I was very worried! I was producing colostrum and was panicing as I had no milk by day 3. I went to bed that night and jumped 4 bra sizes over night! haha. I couldnt believe it. I had enough milk to hydrate my whole street (jokes). I was very happy. It will happen babe. All the best :)|`|P7Bu2I8eaa	I've never heard of being induced labor that breast milk will not come regularly. Induced or not it takes the most 72 hours to actually have a milk flow. The baby will be sucking and only be getting "colostrum" and than the milk will begin to flow. When the child begins latching on good, sometimes the next day you can have milk flow. But dont worry about your child not having breast milk because colostrum is just as good, and its more tha enough even though you might think its little amount.|`|7yd7lNU7aa	Right after you give birth.
YFPMcHCbaa	I'm really getting sick of seeing this type of question on here. No one here will be able to tell you if you are pregnant. Almost all of the symptoms you get during pregnancy can be associated with something else.    Take a test, go to the doctor or do some research before you go asking questions. Chances are, your question has been answered before.    babycenter.com  pregnancy.org  pregnancy.com  americanpregnancy.org  webmd.com/baby  pregnancy360.com  fitpregnancy.com  surebaby.com  pregnancytoday.com|`|5yAsj29Vaa	More details are not needed.  Precum can get a woman pregnant.  It contains as much sperm per drop as a regular ejaculation.  She's got a 50/50 chance of being pregnant.  I suggest before having sex you two get a plan for birth control figured out if you're not wanting to be parents right now.|`|AA10976444	Pre-ejaculate contains semen so she can get pregnant.  Just because you wiped it off does not mean that more didn't come out.  Don't be so stupid again...you will have to wait till her period is due to find out for sure.  Chances can be slim...but not definite|`|dcNmRPGPaa	what exactly are you asking? yes pre-nut can get you pregnant just like a full ejaculation.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	precum can get a woman pregnant. chances of pregnancy are 25% per cylce.|`|kw80YHMLaa	I suggest IF shes not already pregnant you sort out your contraception get her on the pill and still use a condom if you really want to avoid getting pregnant that is if have been luck this time. good luck|`|vXhjBla0aa	when me and my girlfriend had sex i did the same thing she didn't get pregnant..you'll be okay|`|4Yw20J6Saa	Anytime you have unprotected sex there is a chance of pregnancy. It doesn't matter if it pre ejaculate or actual ejaculate they both have sperm in them.|`|e543695437f1f6f6618911f4b037f5b0aa	well i know for a fact that you can beings as i have a 3 year old from it.  even precum has sperm!|`|7yd7lNU7aa	The chances are exactly equal as if it were full on ejaculation.|`|quieXSekaa	There is a very very very slim chance. Infact it would be a miracle if she did end up pregnant. She would have to be ovulatinga and there would have to be enough sperm to move up to get to her egg. Even people who try to get pregnant full on don't succeed. Getting pregnant is not as easy as some people think. I would say you are definantly in the clear. If you are that worried about it have her take a pregnancy test in about 3 weeks. Good Luck and I hope this helped.|`|mQhSxCpoaa	It's possible precum could it.   The chances are 50/50 honey sorry. I mean every time you have sex you run the chance of having a problem. Although if you did the 'pull out' method your chances are a lot better then if you would have continued. I would tell your gf you want her on the shot before you start doing anything in there. If you two made a baby it would be you that would most likely pay for the child support...|`|S5v9I0y2aa	I personally know of a few couples that concieved this way.  It can happen.  The chances of it happening this one time depend on where she was in her cycle.  Let's say she was in her most fertile time, (ovulation), and you had accidentally ejaculated inside her, she would probably have about a 25% chance of becoming pregnant.  But since you didn't, it has to be less than 25%, but still possible.    All the best
5N3odm3Qaa	It is a metaphor, as most dreams are. Maybe you're hiding something from someone you love and the person rubbing your belly is trying to get that information out of you.    Perhaps you feel guilty about something or you're harboring deeper conflicts that have yet to surface. Dreams have a weird way of telling the stories that we can't understand during our waking life.    Dreams are not usually so obvious. This was most likely not a dream about pregnancy.|`|LbHuUxkhaa	For a woman to dream that she is pregnant could be her subconscious telling her that she is actually pregnant. If you're not worried about pregnancy, a dream of being pregnant symbolizes an aspect of your personality or personal life that is growing and developing, but is not yet ready to be talked about or acted upon. It represents the birth of a new idea, direction or goal.|`|McRoWQrAaa	is there any signs you could possibly be pregnant?  if so, take a test. wait and see if you keep having  the dream, maybe it means you will be pregnant  in the near future. lol weird, i had a pregnant dream  last night too haha|`|7yd7lNU7aa	I dreamed I was pregnant. Took a test. Positive.   Take a test.|`|hoX7hoINaa	You could be but it could be your want to be pregnant?|`|S5v9I0y2aa	I've had similar dreams that I was pregnant, going into labour, had a baby, and everything.  I probably had that dream (or variation) once every few months for the last few years.  It never predicted anything, it might just be our hormones in our cycles affecting our dreams, or the things we see or think about.    I wouldn't think that this means that you're pregnant, unless a bunch of other things are going on too( like a missed period, etc).    Now that I am pregnant, I still have these dreams but they are more vivid and usually quite stressful.|`|vR6AwIppaa	don't worry, i have dreams that i'm pregnant all of the time, but i'm not pregnant. i can't wait until i have a baby, but i'm definitely going to wait since i'm only 13 :)
7HzfgRmwaa	a doctor would probably tell you to loss weight before thinking of kids. Sometimes when you are overweight you have fertility problems. I was a bit overweight and only got pregnant the times that I lost a little bit by working out and eating healthier. I'm not sure what other complication arise with being overweight and pregnant. I think maybe high blood pressure and more chance of c-section. You can google that though.     Apparently you can choose to visit a fertility clinic and have them help you even though you are single (Thats what octuplet mommy did) Or you can one night stand and do it alone. YOu can pray for a husband and do it that way or you can find a nice friend to have a baby with??...Or you can be patient and wait for the right man to come along to begin a family with. Good luck.|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	I can think of a couple of wayysssssssssssssss  Go in a dark allyway, stand on the side of a street, wearing a bikini.  Hopefully somebody will pick you up...[lets not hope its a cop]    ONE NIGHT STAND!!!!!  Or a sperm bank will work just fine|`|cJfJd9yaaa	It can be ok to have a baby while overweight however please understand that being overweight puts you at greater risk of being diagnosed with gestational diabetes.  I am not overweight myself however I have been told the all women should aim to be under 100kgs (depending on height) before they attempt to conceive.  It is also easier on your heart and easier for the doctors to examine you while you are pregnant, for complications.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Its better to get yourself into shape before attempting pregnancy, mostly because it will be hard to shed the pounds if you're already over weight, and could possibly cause problems later in pregnancy like preclampsia and such. Have a good diet and get into better shape before going the route of baby. Its best for both of you :)|`|AOfm8ey6aa	Quite honestly, you should give it a time. Every child needs a father as well as a mother. You are still young. I have met my fiance when I was 24. Some women meet their future spouses later. Some when they are over 30. And believe me, it is so much easier to find a new relationship when you don't have any kids. I think you should wait at least 10 more years for the right one, before you try to have a child on your own. It is better for the child and it is better for you. But decision is of course only yours.|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	Adoption! It's a long journey but it's worth it! There are so many kids who need homes in this world, so why not? Also, you would not have to worry about getting in shape for pregnancy...sperm bank...those sort of things.|`|5gHtVI5Caa	get in shape first, then find your self a hot one night stand! lol..no serioulsy, maybe find a guy frined and make an arrangement that you will not go after him for child support, he can sign away his rights...i think single women can raise kids just fine.|`|quieXSekaa	I agree. Losing a little weight will help prepare your body to not only concieve but keep the baby healthy inside you. It's always a good decision to get healthy, but it's an even better idea if you plan on a pregnancy. If you think about it this way:you are that babies only life supply and if your body is in tip top shape it will give the baby the best living environment while growing inside you. Good luck hun. I hope you get your baby and I hope you get healthy too.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Well doctors would recommend you lose a little weight before pregnancy for the health of you and your baby, if you don't and you get pregnant, I don't think anything bad would happen. Lots of overweight women have babies all the time and their fine. Also, just be patient. I know its hard, and you really long for a baby, but you will find the right guy out there eventually and then you'll be able to start a family. but its so hard to raise a kid on your own with out a father in its life. good luck.|`|rctDnhO1aa	it depends on how overweight you are, i'm sure there can be risks but i'm also sure that there are a lot of mom's out there who were overweight when they got pregnant and turned out fine.  your options would be artficial insemination adoption or find yourself a good man or have a one night stand when you're ovulating and hope it causes conception (I wouldn't do that one though because you don't know if they have stds or anything that can be passed along to the baby)|`|vR6AwIppaa	two words. sperm bank.    good luck :)|`|4Yw20J6Saa	Your father is right. Any doctor will tell you that they would like you to lose weight before you attempt getting pregnant. It is healthier for you and the baby. I was considered overweight when I got pregnant even though I didn't think I was. I'm 5' 7" and weighed 170, I wore a size 31 jeans or size 9 depending on which brand you go by. But the doctors only wanted me to gain 10 to 15 pounds throughout the whole pregnancy. It's been really hard for me to keep my weight down. So I would try that before you even think of what your options for having a baby are. I hope that helps a little.|`|7yd7lNU7aa	You will want to loose a little weight for you and the baby. Your pregnancy and birth will be less difficult. As far as the single part, do what your comfortable with. You can look into sperm banks.|`|9vgZNLP8aa	I don't know why but it annoys me when people jump all over a person who is overweight that wants to get pregnant and start giving the, "You better lose weight first" speech. Sure it is better to not be overweight, but then again so are many other things (not smoking, eating well, taking vitamins ect...) but nobody goes after them.    Depending on how overweight you are I would sit down and weigh the pros and cons of going through a pregnancy. It's your body and your choice. Plenty of people who are overweight get pregnant and have children and are just fine.    Good luck.|`|Sl9ybZT7aa	You Know i hate when my family done that to me. but i still had a baby overweight in all who care's what anyone else think because you can have a baby at any size. So go for it.
X0xHXDcTaa	Father and donor's. The eggs were produced from another woman. The lady that is now carrying the baby has no DNA link, but she is still the mother! Because she chose to give this child life!! DNA is only scientific, mothers are way more!|`|YzUPmWTBaa	Only the father's and donater's dna. Interesting question though.. Have you seen Baby Mama? If not, please watch it, it might give some light on the subject, and it will give you a good lauph!|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	The woman who donated the eggs is the real mother. Sorry but just because you have eggs put inside you doesn't make you the real mother. The child gets it's DNA from the egg of the woman who donated the egg, and the father's sperm.|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	Genetically the baby will have the DNA of the egg donor and the sperm donor but the question of who the "real" mother is is more of a philosophical one... a "real" mother is more than DNA.    A child can up to 5 parents:  1 woman to donate the egg  1 man to donate the sperm  1 woman to carry the child  1 woman & 1 man to raise the child
a6beQD7Qaa	(getting ready to get the thumbs down)    I know spanking bothers some people but honestly, it never did me any harm, and I think most parents know how to spank their children without actually doing them any harm.     As for the people who say 4year olds don't understand, as a mother of 2 little boys under 5, they DO know what they're doing, & if they're doing something wrong purely out of spite, it's the parents' responsibility to teach them never to do it again, and if spanking is your punishment of choice, so be it. It is YOUR child. A bad mother is one who lets her child get away with anything & allows her to turn into one of those rotten kids who have no respect for anyone because they never learned the meaning of discipline.|`|jdRKZe18aa	No she is  not a horrible mother.  I probably would have limited the swat to ONE not 3 - but as long as she didn't HIT out of anger I think it might have been worthwhile.   You are right - I think she did it purposely and at the very LEAST she should have been a part of the clean up - which was completely the right thing to do.    She was no doubt MAD at being excluded from the ADULT conversation.....  can't blame her I think but what she chose to do as a result should carry it's consequences and you did so (or your wife did and hopefully you backed her up!).... SO YOU keep thinking she is a good mother  - because she still is!|`|gwUMipsUaa	The child needed it.  I bet the child will have more respect for her mother as she gets older.  Kids nowadays generally don't get spanked, because parents refuse to spank.  These kids are growing up into the most spoiled brat teens I have ever seen, allowed to talk back, spit, hit, etc their parents.|`|oq29JFRfaa	she doesn't sound like a bad mother,  she just got really mad and sometimes you kid just needs to know what they did was really wrong.|`|gCJbudnHaa	Of Course She Did. She Did It Because U Sent Her There. maybe She Did It Because U had Company And Thought U Would Give Her Attention. I Still Think That What Your Wife Did Was 100% Right Maybe Jessica Wont Do It next Time Now She Knows What Happened 2 Her This Time And Thats Where Your Wife Was Right Doing It lets Hope Shes Learned Her Lesson And Will Not Want another Smack.|`|9HzjEbd4aa	well in my opinion beating ur child in any way is wrong, but what your wife did doesn't seem very bad at all. I would reccomend finding another way of disciplining your child. The thing with spanking or any other type of beating, is that it could tramatize the child and lead to abuse later on in his or her life. But, if your wife doesn't do this often, it's probably not that bad. But I would reccomend anything other then spanking. But no your wife doesn't sound like a bad mother.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Thank you for asking this question, I'm very pleased to see how many people are on your side ! That means a lot to me because my son too has had his pants pulled down and a 3 swat bare bottom spanking, not very often, he normally gets just the 1 through the pants but I'm glad you asked this. I am afraid of hitting/spanking my child cause of CPS|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I think it was the perfect punishment.  She will remember that and not do that again i can assure you.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	I don't think she is horrible.  But I think the situation could have been handled better.  Clearly your daughter peed on the floor because she was upset.  You could not spank a 14 year old child for walking up to you and telling you she was upset.  This is how a 4 year old expresses her emotions.  I would have talked her through and maybe given her a time out if she had a bad attitude about it.  Obviously your wife feels bad so I wouldn't worry about it too much.|`|AA12352550	I would have probably done the same thing!!|`|hHjfoKEHaa	That's good parenting.|`|s30Duwdraa	I don't think she's a horrible mother at all!   I'll bet she will never do that again!      Sometimes kids need a good spanking (i'm sure lots of comments will be added to that one!)!  I have a 5 yr old boy and he's gotten a spanking or two for blatant disobedience. Words and threats sometimes don't work...    The fact that you are here looking for answers and that your wife feels really guilty tells me that you are great parents!  Just don't make a habit of it and you all will be fine.    Good luck!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	you need marriage counseling -the issue is about the relationship between the spouses.  don't put the innocent child in the middle.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	If you love your wife and think she did the right thing, then why are you telling everyone, seeking their approval? It happened, your wife handled the situation, and it's over now. Children are stinkers and stubborn at times.|`|6RGnG1ukaa	I don't think your wife is a bad mother. I just think that she could have handled it differently. I personally don't think spanking a child solves anything. I think going over what she did wrong and why she shouldn't have done it helps a lot better. Helping her clean it is not that bad but she is really young to clean pee off the floor. I just think teaching her is better and spanking just gives children more trauma. In this world spanking is becoming more of an issue in society. In the near future which I know seems really far away but by the time your daughter is a mother spanking is going to be a huge issue. It's a known fact then when you are spanked as a child, you tend to spank your children in the future. I just think its not a good idea and there are better ways of handling this whole issue. Good luck and remember talk it out!|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I think she sounds like a great mother.  Parents need to realize it is important to discipline thier children.  She does not need to feel guilty, she should be proud that she stayed in control and did what she needed to do to teach your daughter that her actions were wrong.  I forgot to comment on your wife making her help clean it...Way to Go Mom!!! That'll really hit home with her and she'll learn that actions have consequences...good and or bad depending on the action.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	No she did just as she should, i think she sounds like a wonderful mother.|`|USt4MZSBaa	that was a very reasonable punishment.|`|ylgNuE3uaa	Well, I don't personally agree with spanking... but if you already sent her to her room and she peed, what was your wife supposed to do?  Re-send her to her room?|`|soFpywFcaa	i think she is a good mother u cant spoil your child you don't want her to be a brat its not like it was and accident|`|AA11942055	She doesn't sound like a horrible mother at all, though people who are against any corporal punishment might disagree.  While I don't believe a bare bottom is necessary, I believe that spanking can be necessary and will not have negative effects on the child if explained to them properly.  She understood what she did was wrong, and so it is not out of line to punish her for trying to punish you.  At my work, I see kids misbehaving and their parents don['t deal with it.  It's because parents nowadays are scared to discipline their children that so many of them are out of control.  Much more than in the past.|`|eya1WDS4aa	nope not a bad mom at all! I would have done the same thing!|`|9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	I was spanked more than once as a child and I honestly believe I'm a better person for it.|`|6ead7e745899491ccfd40dbc9c7d5ef6aa	What?! Are you kidding me? Of course she deserved a spanking! especially if she did it on purpose! She knew what she did because she said WHY she did it. Hell, in my opinion, three little spanks were too little. What other action could have been done? Time out? That doesn't get anything accomplished. The kids end up entertaining themselves in the corner and begin to enjoy their "privacy."    Thats the problem with parents these days. They're don't punish their kids with a good spanking. No wonder we have so many badass kids today.|`|vIXttNHGaa	its called child melesting. she could get arrested for that if the daughter was in school and had a teacher to tell.   plus 4 is the age when kids just dont get it. they dont understand that they have to do everything the right way when theyre mad. she just thought 'im mad. ill do something to make her regret sending me to my room.' she doesnt know how to control it and to do the right thing when she doesnt want to. she should be punished, but in a legal way. making her help clean up is good.   and youre really mean for thinking it was the right thing to do! shame shame. (jk, but seriously.)  ~c.~|`|aAjpk4ylaa	I'm sure you will get ppl having a fit that you spank your child.  Ignore them.  I think your wife was just fine in punishing her.  If she put welps or something on her bottom, that's a different thing.  But a pop on the bottom isn't abuse and she certainly should be punished for peeing in the floor on purpose.  She knew what she was doing.  I have a little boy that just turned 5.  They know how to push your buttons at a young age.  Does she feel bad b/c she doesn't use spanking normally or b/c she did it too hard?  Remind your wife this tho- They are able to say such mean things to us from time to time- "You are so mean"- because they are secure enough in our love for them.  If she didn't know that she was truly loved, she would not feel comfortable enough to say such things upon occassion.  Of course, if she says it everyday and means it, might need to look into that more.|`|ZXhpEuGpaa	Ahh,it is so hard to spank your child especially when they are 5years and under,i have a 5 month old daughter and just picturing having to spank her makes me want to cry,i have a 8yr. old son and its hard to spank him(sometimes,lol)but to answer your question,as hard as it was to do i think she did the right thing,it does'nt make her a bad mother she did it to teach her a lesson,this is the time to start teaching your child right from wrong,she will proberly be glad she done some of the things she is going to half to do,as well as you dad.It is normal to hurt when you half to punish your precious little bundles of joy.|`|10mOwk0Taa	There may have been other ways to punish your daughter, but it doesn't sound excessive or anything so I think what your wife did is fine.  I think the fact that she feels bad about it just proves she's a good mother!!|`|7b9950c99c6ea90a89b5e6b29c014f81aa	No she sounds like a good mom, there's nothing wrong with spanking. Now if she would of beat the child in a harmful way that would make her a bad mother.  I agree your daughter deserved to be spanked because is not like she even tried running to  the bathroom she just peed on the floor intentionally.|`|DPegPYRPaa	I believe she deserved it. I probably would have done the same thing. But maybe only 1 bare bottom spank. 3 might have been a little bit of an overreaction.|`|bghotovYaa	Jessica deserved it!!  How dare she do that!!!  Tell your wife she is a GOOD mother!|`|MOsStEbqaa	No i think that she deserved it. Your wife did the right thing.|`|sEr58mAVaa	You should never physically punish your child. She is not a bad mother, but she made a bad decision.|`|cNHsQn2Raa	that punishment seems appropriate to me, I would have done the same thing, only if her "accident" was intentional of course.|`|d0JqmXjKaa	Your wife did just what I would've done.  Your daughter had to be punished.|`|F3G0EB4Xaa	She is definitely not a horrible mother! One bare-bottomed spanking is not enough qualification for Worst Mother of the Year. Your daughter Jessica needed to be punished and your wife handled it fine.|`|72oUAXWTaa	well she should be punished but quite personally i think the spanking was a bit much  well i never got a "bare bottom spanking"  the cleaning up is good/in a kind of strange way|`|ESCoacnjaa	I think it was fine..although making her help clean up was a bit far|`|dSMdm76Iaa	No she's not a bad mother. My wife and I would have done the same thing. I would look a little more into why your daughter did what she did and why she called her mother mean.|`|bfQfeUq5aa	seeing as she is only 4 i understand if it is her first time  children do stuff ll the time with out thinking becase she is so young  i guess ur wife maybe overacted she is only 4!  i dont know how much i can help because im 13 but im always at my friends house who has 3 little sisters  i guess things get stressful and u cant help but getting mad  i see y she got mad and i think it was a natural reaction!!    i hope i helped :)|`|DRuLCmIVaa	Nope hitting is not the answer. My parents used to beat me and I still was a terror. I wouldn't of hit her myself. A bit too much!|`|iHkbrJF1aa	No I don't think your wife is harsh, I think shes letting your daughter know who the boss is in this relationship and the fact that she did it intentionally shows that she can be calculated and spiteful in her actions. If your daughter was allowed to get away with that sort of behaviour every time she didn't get her own way, she'd grow up to be an impossible brat who is always hard to please and she would not appreciate anyone or anything in her life. I commend your wife for nipping this problem straight in the bud, things will settle down quickly and your daughter will learn to repect you more for setting rules of do's and don'ts and know the conseqences if she decides to break any rules.    Carrie above me you are wrong, 4 year olds know exactly what they are doing, as she peed on the floor for spite, it was to draw attention onto herself, this lady is not a bad mother at all. Bad parents are the ones that do noting and let their children grow up wild and disrepectful!|`|WbJPQM1naa	I don't like the word "BAD" and take issue with that.  I never say to my children, "You are bad"... Instead I say, "I'm very disappointed in your BAD behavior"      NO, your wife is NOT a "bad" mother for correcting your young daughter's willful disobedience.  I have a four year old, and for the most part, I use time out techniques to teach her how to behave.  But, if I was in the same situation, I would have done exactly what your wife did!  Please encourage her that she did and IS doing a great job as a mom!  Parenting is hard and where a lot of parents seem to get into to trouble is when they always want to keep their kids happy.  Good parenting is NOT a popularity contest!  You're not always going to be liked by your child.  It's that simple.    Good luck and take good care,  R|`|OUhd54Zaaa	I have no problem with OCCASIONAL spanking. every time their in trouble? no. But your children need to have a small amount of fear and respect for the parent.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	i think your wife did perfect. i would have done the same thing. i can bet she won't be peeing on the floor again, and that is the goal right?|`|9s9Baglyaa	I dont know how many times people have had ot say this, but SPANKING IS WRONG!!!!
kzyEuRroaa	try cotton gauze- you can buy this at any wal-mart, joanns, etc and make your own, or lightweight muslin- Aden and Anais blankets rock!!!|`|c4e518a123e1b13a4b34572b4563c670aa	Maybe you could use cotton?|`|I7myOp8Qaa	Depends on where you stay and I assume you are talking about clothes/blankets? I live in a very hot part of California where temperatures reach an all time high of 100 as early as June. So I would say soft, breathable materials which cover baby but allow for air flow. Cotton would probably be best.|`|4AO2myzKaa	Cotton!
miPubuDYaa	I can't see why not. I went to a concert around x-mas time to see MEATLOAF. I was about 4 months pregnant. And the baby was bopping around alittle to the music. Or so i wished. LOL    My suggestion to you is this. If it a high energy concert stay away from everyone. If you have assigned seats, just sit back and relax and allow everyone else go crazy and just enjoy the music. If you don't have assigned seats. I wouldn' personally go because i would be afraid someone would knock me over or somehow accidentally hurt my baby belly.|`|4AO2myzKaa	You can go, but keep to the back and don't go near the mosh pit!  Have fun!|`|Bs8sllD9aa	The best person to be talking to this about is your doctor!|`|U0KCmsKXaa	It depends on what kind of concert it is.  Is it like a heavy metal concert where you might be standing all night with pushing and moshing?  If this is the case, I'd say no.  But if it's like a symphony concert or some other concert where you'll be sitting the whole time, you should be fine.|`|qdLdcR8Maa	as long as your not going to get some ones elbow jabbing you in your side and people knocking you about i think you should be fine!    Just check out the nearest hospital to the concert just incase your waters break! lol|`|IFDfpbFJaa	It really depends on how close you are sitting to the show or speakers.....a certain amount of decibels can harm the baby but I'm not sure how loud that is. I know when I was in the military I wasn't allowed to be around the aircraft because their sound was enough to out right make me LOSE the baby, but we had ground equipment that I couldn't be around either that wasn't as loud, but it wouldn't kill the baby, it would just hurt it....so ask your doctor or research the decibels that will hurt the baby.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I went to a concert (Stereophonics) when I was 35 weeks pregnant. I rang my midwife and my doctor and both advised that AS LONG as I was seated and there was no chance of getting hit in the stomach it was fine. The only downside was the loud music woke my daughter up and she spent the entire time headbutting my bladder lol :) ring your midwife and ask her.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	you should be careful because you could get pushed down and hurt the baby.|`|I7myOp8Qaa	You may want to talk to your doctor about this. Concerts are notorious for crowds and you may get jostled and hurt.|`|AA11352641	Sure as long as you have a place to sit down when you feel like you need to and can avoid a crowd that may get rowdy, like close to the stage.|`|McRoWQrAaa	exactly what type of concert?  if its not a calm one then do not go.|`|SKqV374maa	why would you even take that kind of a chance   why not go another time when you don't have a human life forming inside you, and you had better get use to not getting what you want after this baby comes|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	I went to a concert when I was 19 weeks pregnant. Just what you should do is stay in the very very back away from people or have your boyfriend protect your tummy the hole time. I was smart to ask my friend to protect me becuase we got in the middle of 3 fights and a mosh pit. And she'd jump in front of me and hold me close to her and she even got bruise all over her back(which proves if she didnt protect me my baby could have gotten hurt. Anyways I went to a CRAZY concert just like almost 2 weeks ago. Just tell him to protect your tummy or stay away from the crowd. Hope I helped. Congrats on your little one:)    PS- I went to a CRAZY concert. Papa Roach, Buckcherry, Saving Abel, and Avenged Sevenfold were playing and the crowds was crazy. But as long as my friend protected me, me and the baby were fine.
PqA5hCfbaa	I am 38 weeks tomorrow and i have been having them off and on. My doctor says it is just my body preparing for the labor. i know that is not the answer you want to hear but i think it is the truth. ha!|`|4AO2myzKaa	Braxton hicks - ie false labor.  It's pretty common at this point.  When they start becoming regular (like you can set your watch to them), get stronger, and last longer then you will be in real labor.  I had some false labor as well yesterday (also 35.5 weeks) that went away after shifting positions and getting some sleep.  Your body is just preparing for labor....I would take it as a sign to tie up loose ends - make sure your bags are packed, your birth plan is in order, and your house is fairly clean because baby will be here shortly regardless!  Good luck!|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	just your body stretching out to get ready|`|hoX7hoINaa	I'm 33 weeks and experiencing the cramping.

I had that at that stage of pregnancy. Mine were almost like Braxton Hicks. But, no it was just everything getting prepared.|`|I7myOp8Qaa	You should contact your doctor immediately. It might not be anything but if you have menstrual like cramps it could mean you are having contractions. You are not yet full term so if these are contractions and preterm labor then the doctor can help stop those contractions. If not, at least you erred on the side of caution. Good luck.|`|AA10478146	It sounds normal.  You're body is just getting ready for labor.  Hopefully the cramps are changing your cervix and baby will come in a couple of weeks.|`|Pf5obGu4aa	I heard that sometimes when a women is going to be having a baby soon she will start to have cramps it might be that you are having a false alarm.  If you think it is something serious you should see your doctor.|`|cCdhHyF8aa	You may be experiencing Braxton Hicks contractions.

uFrqC4Y2aa	I felt that way too when I got pregnant, but not that soon after.|`|soFpywFcaa	sound like implantation bleeding its usually 6 days after ovulate could be later or sooner but since your period isn't due its probably implantation
uFrqC4Y2aa	Yes.  A very high chance.|`|yCR6qg0baa	Obviously there is a possibility.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Of course.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Yes, definitely if you didn't use protection.  Even if you had sex three days before ovulation there is a good chance you will become pregnant.  If your period is late, test and then retest several days later if your period still doesn't come and your first test was negative.|`|596ddaee42df0ec8a6b9d7b4242c6338aa	Yes, there is a definite chance.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	Well theres always a possibility when you have unprotected sex around ovulation time!!!!!|`|9a3sNrEqaa	if you have unprotected sex then YES you could be pregnant. Are you trying to get pregnant?? If you are then you have a good shot! GOOD LUCK and baby dust!!!|`|294Yjrayaa	yes if unprotected sex without pills|`|YpgoGNuXaa	Yup, if you don't use some sort of birth control or protection you can get pregnant, ESP. when you are ovulating. Good luck.|`|2c46e9d59ec16a4592fc195d06bac42eaa	There is ALWAYS a possibility
rqOIqO7Raa	I have heard that it can take up to week 12 to hear it, I know when I went in at 8 weeks they didn't think they would pick it up, but they did. I heard all my babies heartbeats around 7-8 weeks.    But you can see the fetus in the ultra-sound..even without hearing the heartbeat so there would be no mistake you are pregnant.|`|cncAzZPiaa	Most Dr.s will check for a heartbeat at 10 weeks, since MOST babies are mature enough by then. SOME hear it earlier, and some hear it later. Everyone is different.|`|ec505b9bfac1af14a0ebfaeef28d6657aa	It is still soon. I had an u/s at six weeks and did not see the heartbeat but it was there at 7 weeks. It seems that around 7-8 weeks is the magic time when the heartbeat becomes visible. Good luck!|`|7yd7lNU7aa	It is very rare that the heartbeat is detectable at 6 weeks. No worries. I went in a 10 weeks and they told me not to get my hopes up. I did hear it but is was very faint.|`|zSABr7praa	I had an ultrasound at 5 weeks and they couldn't find the embryo OR the heart beat.  Scary, but common.  They found both at 8 weeks :)  Best of luck!|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	It has not happened to me but, I have heard of it happening to other people.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	No, both times I had a heartbeat show on the ultrasound screen at 6 weeks.
c34a69b660dd513be115a1717804b175aa	Ok... First of all your baby may be in a breech position, but (s)he has PLENTY of time to move into position! All the way until the end of the EIGHTH MONTH! So if your doctor said (s)he is in a breech position that was just at the time. Your baby can still do backflips in your tummy (s)he has so much room! So DON'T WORRY! I am 37 almost 38 weeks now and my baby just got into position last week! They can try to manually move the baby into position if (s)he decides to stay breeched. But I doubt (s)he is even still in that position now!   As for the contractions, it is completely normal to have Braxton Hicks contractions at this stage. I got them earlier than that! I panicked and went to the hospital! The kinda laughed at me and said it's fine. You will have them alot more! Sux! You can tell they are Braxton hicks because they are usually low and irregular. They just come and go. No consistency.   As for your bladder, get used to that! It gets worse! Currently I have to use the bathroom at least once every 2 hours! Even when I'm sleeping! You have NOTHING to worry about! Everything sounds normal to me! If you worry about stuff like this it is nice to be informed to make you feel better. Some good resources are...  A pregnancy week by week book! These  are the best! You can buy them anywhere they sell books! I highly recommend getting one!  Also there are week by week websites...    babyzone.com  pregnancyweekly.com  and another good website is  earthmamaangelbaby.com    And childbirth classes! No they are not just for natural childbirth! They are very informative and even show you your options for pain meds in the hospital!  I hope this helped! I have all these resources here with me so if you have any questions feel free to e-mail me! just click my picture and click e-mail. Good luck and CONGRATS!|`|350bb1c45534c856a6a8909adea8bb0aaa	I am old OB nurse, honest to John, so sounds like Braxton-Hicks, or better known as false labor to me.  No blood? Pains don"t intensify?  It"s like uterus is "practicing" for real labor. If you"re that far along, should be seeing doc often anyhow, so ask when you go in.  Or if really worried, call. Not much you can do about how babe is pressing bladder.  Won"t be much longer...hang in there.  When you think  pregnancy is permanent tumor, you are close to due date.|`|909b15bb9c12a8939d88fa1404ac0fb4aa	that's normal eventually he'll turn hopefully he probably is kicking your bladder my daughter did that alot i would just kinda move her alittle or at least try your only 29 weeks wait until your 36 weeks you talk about pressure now omg its almost over good luck i feel ya on this one|`|f86d642ac0d3f8429f4cb6506f28df50aa	As long as the contractions are not regular in length and time, I don't think you have anything to worry about. They are called Braxton Hicks Contractions, its your body's way of getting ready. I had them for 12 weeks before my baby was born. Along with you, my baby was breech until 2 weeks before I delivered, and then she just turned, most of them do, I wouldn't worry about that either. I'm not a doctor but when you do go to the doctor, he will probably tell you the same thing. Good luck and take care!|`|ebf3f8b0bb4ce7d56d2e1932e76e367faa	You could be having what they call Braxton Hicks it false labor pains that occur early in pregnancy.  I feel for you and your lil one having a breeched baby is no fun thats for sure. Hopefully all goes well for you and you can carry him/her for the full time. Good luck|`|61380560f287444cf3d858b7e555eb30aa	today is monday go see your obstetrician!!!     the pain you're describing could be nothing, but it could also be something very major (placenta previa), where the placenta breaks away from the uterus and can cause the death of the fetus (& mom).     the "pins and needles" on the bladder i remember; it aint fun, but it's pretty normal.     you should definately talk to your dr. about maybe having an induction to insure that your breech baby is born without any other complications.     thank god that you were able to know ahead of time that your baby is breech.|`|AA11045471	try to keep him in there for 6 more weeks!!    what you're going through is "false labor" which mean he's almost ready (i'm sorry i'm saying him, but whatever)    You're fine and this is normal. if you dont want to go to the doctor, at least call.    if i may reccomend a book for you, get the book "your babys 1st year week by week". best book EVER

93a8a08ec92609c0242ef04df03f4a8faa	Yes, very possible.   When my husband and I decided to have a child, we decided to have sex everyday to conceive. Within 30 days we was pregnant. Our daughter is now 8.|`|AA10921813	anything is possible!|`|725ae0b1b54d352eb0834a12557ca609aa	well i think its fourteen days after your last period.. but u should really ask your doctor..|`|AA10168310	Yes there is a chance. Keep in mind that sperm can survive up to three days in the vaginal canal so if you ovulated any time during that time frame, it is a possibility you could get pregnant.|`|c3dcff4a3f7cc2934c0ee92bae3fa5eeaa	Generally speaking, you would be ovulating and would be most likely to get pregnant at about the halfway point of your cycle, starting your counting from the first day you start your period.  If you have a 28 day cycle, you would start on the first day you start your period.  Usually you would be ovulating about thirteen to sixteen days later, and if you have sex a lot during that window of time, you're more likely to conceive.  It's really uncommon, but not exactly unheard of, that you could get pregnant at different times.    They do have the ovulation test sticks (similar to pregnancy tests) that let you know exactly when you are ovulating.    Happy baby-making!|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	If the first day of your last period was 10/3 then you should be ovulating around 10/17 and you will be able to get a positive pregnancy test around 11/13. (Based on a 28 day cycle.) I wish you the best!|`|ccfcc8e8cd94519c0bfa17f12bd72222aa	yeah it is. In between each period is when you seem to be the most fertile. I would try a coulpe more times about two or three days a part ot make sure.|`|acaaa77d5e73ebdcbca2a04cdf35a052aa	usually thats the time 2 start trying 4 a baby.10 -14 days after your period.so its possible.good luck.|`|ff6f1cc67eae594ce5b79cf5f64e2390aa	I think so, I got pregnant 7 days after my period, I think I read somewhere once :-) that it was 7 to 10 days after you finish your period that you are most likely to fall pregnant, but nature is a funny thing and like someone said anything is possible, we don't have all the answers.  If its what you want, all the best.
HuKDmP4Paa	This is really sad.     I think the most common way for a baby to end up with an unknown marker would be for a mother to abandon the child say for instance a dumpster, or alley way. When the baby is discovered and the investigation unit fails to identify the child it would receive an unknown marker.     Also another possibility of this is that perhaps the infant died young and the parents were unable to afford a proper burial. I know funerals are expensive, and I know when families sometimes are unable to afford it the government is required to bury the deceased, and they usually get the lowest cheapest means of burial.     If you are serious about this issue I would register at the bank an account number where people can donate to. Go talk to the bank about setting something like this up that way it is certified and people feel like it is going to the cause that you are stating.    Good luck with this endeavor.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Someone in my community was doing so, I donated $650.00. My friend Tinka has six dead children, all miscarriges. I had to buy all their tombstones.|`|pXSKSS3daa	That's heart breaking!    I think what you're wanting to do is absolutely amazing. Go for it. It may take some time to get it up and running but word of mouth is the best way to get something out there.    I sincerely hope(and pray) this works out. Those poor little babies(even dead and decomposing as someone put it...) deserve to be known.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	I would def donate money, but Idk how much of a difference that would make.  Yes they def deserve a proper tombstone and of course a prior burial, but I think what matters more is that the parents have a lot of pictures of them to remember them by. and that their parents have a permanent place for them in their heart. Having a proper tombstone wont ever bring them back sadly, but it's the concept of it that matters, and it makes a difference to the parents or whoever cared for them.  I also think the "i am sorry" one is very sad, but I don't think it implies anything about the parent doing something---I think the parent(s) just felt so helpless that they lost their baby and are sorry that they did and that they couldn't "save" them.|`|1hciyvKdaa	It is sad. The cities could eaily and cheaply do a large memorial and add names to those who are buried by the city (meaning parents were unable to pay for the services)|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No.  There are many thousands of unmarked graves. Hundreds of thousands.  Most people who died in institutions were buried in unmarked graves.  Slaves were.  Poor people were.  There are also millions of graves that no one ever visits anymore.  It's a fact of life.|`|b71BxLUZaa	I would donate. That's sad...And that last picture was really odd!|`|vOomJtbsaa	This is so disturbing and sad!   Where are these babies at, coming from??  I don't understand.  What's with the last grave marker??   I would definitely donate though, that is just terrible!|`|FHT6wsUpaa	If someone in my community were raising money for this, I would definitely donate. That's so sad.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	That is so sad..I was wondering the same, why not have at least the last name? I bet you will have a lot of support from your community if you start that. I know I would donate.        hmm I wonder who the TD troll was this time...they can't give it a rest even in a subject like this one...really now.|`|A89ezcg5aa	I would definitely donate money for something like this.  Looking at those tombstones and markers makes me so sad, ecspeically the one's that say "unknown".|`|pVWk12oOaa	Where do these "unknown infants" come from!??  I don't understand why there are so many..    The "I am sorry" one gave me chills...      So sad|`|o2YHnKXiaa	If this were happening in my community I would defiantly donate money to help out this is so sad. I think you should start something up in your community and point out how these infants need a proper gravestone.|`|yCR6qg0baa	That's really strange. I've been to some old (100+ years) cemeteries where they would say, "Unborn child" or something like that. Maybe there had been an orphanage fire at some point (before forensics & DNA and all that) and they didn't know what else to do. Maybe they were aborted babies or something. Maybe some were still-births & the parents didn't want to name it (a bonding experience, very sad with a stillborn).     I personally would not donate money. There are much better ways I could spend it. In this economy, if someone has the money to give to a charity, why not do something that helps the living? Those babies are decomposed & their souls are not buried in a box. Who cares? Obviously there was no family to claim them. I think most people would not donate.|`|Ew2wC9piaa	i would donate what i could we just had a hurricane go through here back in september (IKE) there should at least be a real stone with the engraving even if it is unknown not just paper how cheap. and the one that says i am sorry is kind of creepy if you know what i mean. Shriner's burn hospital in galveston was closed because they could not afford the repairs after IKE and i think there should have been a fundraiser to help them get back on there feet. i would send money for that too|`|vJEatJFPaa	Absolutely..    These little angels deserve this.|`|oUBUWfS6aa	An unknown infant is usually a infant that was murdered and there is no records found and no parents/family members will step up and identify the baby.    If I ever have the extra money, I would help get a proper tombstone for those who died.|`|BdE4GquHaa	It's an incredible idea, it's something i think is a really worthy cause, there aren't enough people in the world as thoughtful as you!|`|ZKm894kfaa	I agree w/ Barbara.  If someone in my community were doing it I would definitely donate money.  I would help by doing fundraisers and such as well.  It is very sad especially being dubbed as "unknown infant".  This brings tears to my eyes

No one here will be able to tell you if you are pregnant. Almost all of the symptoms you get during pregnancy can be associated with something else.

If you are having weird symptoms you should ask your mom to take you to a gynecologist.  If you are too scared to ask your mom, then go to a free clinic.  You should tell them your symptoms, as they are more knowledgeable than we are.  Even if you don't go to a gynecologist, maybe just your family doctor.  Tell them your symptoms without telling them you had unprotected sex.  See what they say.  Your symptoms could be more severe than an unwanted pregnancy.  Talk to a professional!
dPgP28Aiaa	3 months  I haven't had any bad ones so far, absolutely no morning sickness, no bad emotions. So probably the worst thing for me has been weird food cravings at 2 in the morning xD  I haven't yet :P  I'm hoping to have a natural delivery, but my doctor says I may have to have a c-section because I have a small pelvis :(   I personally want to do it naturally  As far as I can see cuz I'm already showing, I'm carrying low  Not yet but I probably will  I don't know yet      Hahah I guess this was more for women who've already had their babies :P ahh well.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I just had my third baby 2 months ago.

If your doctor is letting you choose between vaginal and c-sec, you've chosen the wrong doctor. C-secs are only if you can't deliver vaginally, they shouldn't be offered as a "choice." I know your doctor thinks it's fine, but the human body recovers better after a vaginal and there are always risks with any surgery.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I'm a few days shy of 20weeks.

Whether you have a vaginal delivery or a C-section is really up to you and your doctor.  Just because someone answering here had a certain experience doesn't mean you will.       Personally I am fed up with women who tell me I'm lucky to be getting a C-section.  They never had abdominal surgery, but I have and am not looking forward to an over-one-month-long recovery from the cutting, bleeding from the incision site for weeks afterward, persistent pain for over a year afterward, and loss of sensation in the lower abs (some of it permanent).  All of the above happened following fibroid surgery over a year ago.  The C-section will be through the same cut, and the doctor warned that the experience will be similar.  I'm grateful that the surgery allowed me to get pregnant but am not looking forward to the delivery at 39 weeks.    The symptoms I disliked the most were hip joint pain and burning at the surgical scar (in the same area that kept bleeding last time).  I've carried both high early on and low currently with a few stretch marks on the side where the hips are.    Please note my experience is not typical of women delivering by C-section.  I'm just sharing it to show you there are lots of different experiences and not to base your delivery decision on what other women have told you.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	I'm 31 weeks.  I'm hating the whole messed up sleep schedule.  I have not delievered yet.  I don't know what kind to recommend, but I hear c-sections are pretty excrutiating.  I feel like I'm carrying high.  I have a few stretch marks on my sides  I'm hoping they go away :)|`|XCueIYnYaa	Im 14.5 weeks, i hate the headaches(no morning sickness), havent delievered, I want vaginal delivery, not showing too much yet, no stretch marks  if i get them i hope they go away or atleast fade quite a bit.|`|zSABr7praa	The doctor won't give you a choice as to how you'd like to deliver.  A doctor always prefers vaginal unless there are complications, or a previous c-section.  The weight will come off the diet and exercise. 95% of pregnant women get stretch marks somewhere on thier body, it's nothing to be ashamed of, they will fade...YOU MADE A HUMAN!  You should be proud of yourself AND your body, not upset about a few pounds or stretch marks.  Best of luck!    Edit: That surprises me, i'm a nurse at a Naval hospital, and i've never met a doctor that gives the option.
reO9Dgmsaa	I use California Baby with tea tree and lavender, or Burts Bees.  I don't buy the main brands since I don't want those additives on my daughter's skin.|`|pXSKSS3daa	We use Target's Lavender scented shampoo and Huggies lavender scented wash. I LOVE the smell of both. For lotion I use Johnson and Johnson cucumber melon(this is my husband's favorite to use on him).|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	I like the Johnson's Shea and Cocoa butter body wash and lotion, and I like the regular Johnson's shampoo.|`|A7SJT50Kaa	i use dr bronner's soap...usually lavender, but currently it's the unscented "baby soap"    for lotion, we use coconut oil or   olive oil with a little lavender essential oil.|`|ZlNFOgO7aa	I love the avon vanilla and soy milk. It smells so yummy.|`|9PqAOQu1aa	The Johnson's Bedtime stuff smells so good!|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I love the classic Johnson&Johnson baby wash.     But I just found a goat milk lotion that I absolutely love the scent of. It's normally really expensive but I got a bunch of it at 90% off. I paid like a $1.40 a piece. I bought everyone they had! which was like 20... SO worth it though. Hubby was teasing me, but even he likes the scent of it. I caught him using it after his shower the other day...lol|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	I love the smell of normal baby lotion but I always used cetaphil because my kids have very dry skin.|`|780ByZVEaa	aveeno and zwitsal|`|K5TrkUhCaa	I just use the original Johnson's shampoo, head-to-toe wash, and lotion.

My fav. brand is by "Canus" And its just regular goat milk soap...they also have lotions and a baby line. BUT I could only find it in Whistler's Mountain area in B.C.

BUT as far as how well the lotion works, the Aveeno Baby lotion for extra dry skin works amazing on my son's dry skin. His skin behind his ear was actually cracked and it cleared it up in a day. It just has no scent which is why I like the smell of the Johnson and Johnson lotion. Huggies also makes awesome lotion, I think it goes with the Natural Care collection.    I love the Johnson and Johnson lavendar baby shampoo and I also love the Huggies baby wash. I have yet to find a bubble bath that I like though.
6lSbmXunaa	Hey, I feel for you. Been there and still trying to stop being shy.  You have to remember to take chances because you only have one life to live, it's more fun that way! Stretch your comfort zone.  You're shy, right? So start off by raising your hand in class instead of just sitting there quietly.  Give compliments- they'll make you seem friendly and people will warm up to you.  Remember, people don't always judge you. A lot of the time, they're worried about how THEY look and what you think of THEM. Don't stress.  It may seem scary at first but if you just loosen up and be yourself, you'll find you're making new friends out the   wa-zoo!  Good luck, and I hope I helped you! Let me know if you need anything else!|`|ZX2so3twaa	i know exactly how you feel.  i used to be the same way.  when i go to talk to them, i say and do things that i would around my girl friends. just be yourself [as cheesy as it sounds] and it'll get easier to talk to them :)|`|rE9J1DqTaa	What i did was think of them as my best friend. I just went up and looked at them and said hey whats up im (insert your name here) after they responded i would just talk to them if its hard to make eye contact then move around make hand movements and try and look around a little.  http://www.shakeyourshyness.com/    Heres a website that helps you with shyness.    I hope i helped|`|58eHufb3aa	Just take a risk.  I was dealing with the same issues as you. But then i realised when i talked and spoke up that it had a better aftermath than when i'd just be quiet. Just realise that nothing really bad(it's not like you'd die) would happen by talking to a boy.|`|KdR1Lx3yaa	JUST BE URSELF PRACTICE ON UR FRIENDS  THAT MIGHT HELP ALOT ..JUST TAKE A RISK DONT THINK ABOUT IT.DO IT|`|0ayP21R9aa	If boys try to talk to u take advantage of that.People tell me im pretty too but i dont see it...im extremly self-concious but wouldnt consider myslef 2 be shy.Next time a guy talks  2 u ,stand up straight and look into his eyes and listen 2 wat he says...also when the time comes flirt like theres no tommorow|`|lbABfa2taa	its okay to be a little bit shy but when one of those guys walks up to you again you should probably start with a little bit of small talk and don't be self conscious about your body because i'm sure once they start talking to you, you will find something you have in common with them and the conversation will flow much better. as for having people stare at you because you don't have a history with romance don't feel intimidated at least you aren't used up like some hoes i know.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? I wouldn't worry about him. Three months is nothing to cry over. At least it wasn't a decade long relationship. He is pretty pathetic if he can't tell you straight why he wants to end it, and comes up with some bull lie. ??|`|cLgghhuXaa	Key phrase:  "p.s ive never tried contacting him at all..!!"    ... Has HE tried to contact YOU? I have a feeling he was cheating on you OR was looking at other chicks... ESPECIALLY if it made no sense to you... a guy who was truly interested in you would've called you even if you hadn't contacted him.    The best way for you to get over him is to be nice to him. (Sounds weird right?) and What will this do? ONE it makes YOU the good person... you know it, he'll know it... and others will recognize it too! (I mean how freaking awesome of a chick to YOU have to be to be kind even to those who suck!)    Just a simple smile and wave in his direction will do... (do more if you want.) The glow you will give off will attract others... it will cause the guy to do a double take (why did I leave her?)... and YOU, well you just get to feel great! be great! look great! Go get 'em girl!|`|wObmwK1uaa	he obviously wanted to break up with you as it seems that he was trying every excuse to make you break up with him so he didn't look like the bad one, there are plenty more guys out there x|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Well to start with you have done EXACTLY the right thing by not contacting him.  You have done nothing wrong .  He is a young lad and this is what young lads do all the time.    You just need to put it behind you and move on.
UcgWrGaAaa	Honey, labor on your hands and knees to help the baby into position.  It sounds like he is sunny side up, that is face up, it can make for a harder labor if his back is pressing on your back.  If you get on your hands and knees the heavier part of him, his spine should move around forward.  Good Luck...Let us know.|`|10mOwk0Taa	It sounds like those are labor pains!!  I would call the doctor if I were you.|`|T1hZG4O3aa	Sounds like your labor may be starting. Keep an eye out for the pain and if you start having contractions. You will pretty much know when you are in labor. I thought I wouldnt know what was oging on but I did. Try some floor stretches to open up your hips and pelvis but nothing strenuous. It will help your back and help open up your cervix a bit. Good luck and grats on the baby any day.|`|tDuMsa1daa	its deffo a poss that things could be starting, back ache is one of the tell tale signs, I had a S&S with my last and it worked 48 hrs later (had my show the day after having it).    fingers crossed her and good luck :)|`|AA10901728	i did that when i went into labor it felt as if i worked hard all day and my back was hurting badly went to the dr and i was 4 cm dilated i would walk if i were you and see if contractions started and if not go to the dr it couldn't hurt good luck|`|rctDnhO1aa	i was living with my boyfriends sister when she was pregnant (had the baby in dec) but she got a membrane sweep and later that night went into labor and gave birth early the next morning.  she said that like a high percentage of women who get the membrane sweep go into labor within 24 hours
p47llYuGaa	maybe you're just stressed about the pregnancy...don't stress or worry too much, you should go back to normal! You'll probably want to cook delicious meals for your new child someday :)|`|pKr77Vqiaa	It will go away you are prob just to uncom because of the baby weight and to tyrd you will feel better alittle after birth|`|AA11763588	It will come back. I've had 2 kids and every time I get pregnant I tend to become "lazy" not by choice of course.    Good luck!|`|dkYuUl5oaa	No sorry|`|AA12081834	After the baby is born you will not have time to cook and clean. :)  I'm sure once you and baby get on a schedule you will feel more like your old self. Congratulations and good luck!    Psstt...maybe your husband could cook dinner for you every once in awhile too. Oh and his hands will not fall off if he washes a dish.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I was the same way with my babies. I was just so exhausted that I didn't  want to do it. Now that our last baby is 2 months old I have gotten it back and my husband is very appreciative!! You will get it back eventually. Don't make it a huge deal though. Your health and the health of your baby come first. Good luck!!!|`|6JTNujAjaa	Take it easy, everything will eventually go back to normal.  Your body is probably exhausted that's why there is no passion for cooking and cleaning.Focus on you,husband and baby as the house work and cooking will always be there in never ends so don't stress.  Good luck with baby!|`|HoJ1pLtraa	Juss relax for now and try to pick up the routine back after the baby is born and hopefully everything will be fine|`|Uu2z6PR3aa	you may be sick of it because its all you might be doing because you're pregnant and cannot do much?    when you give birth, you will have a child to look after and will be quite worn out...but will need to cook and clean still..    I'm guessing for the next 2 or so years you will not enjoy cooking or cleaning because of your baby,  but when it has grown more and is less reliant you will most likely get your love back for cooking and cleaning :P|`|AA12255473	well, are you wearing shoes?    We know you're pregnant, and we can only assume that you probably spend some time in the kitchen each day, but we don't know if you're barefoot or not, so maybe that's the key.    ok, it's probably a bad joke.    listen,  you're pregnant and going through a tough phase, and will be going through even more tough times with that baby, just give yourself some credit.  I think you might get some of that love of cooking back when you start getting some rest and your kids don't keep you up all night anymore.|`|eoFyvtYcaa	youre just probably really stressed out    just wait till after you give birth    then relax for a couple of months    and then try and start doing it again =]
1ASc1Is7aa	Don't confront her, I would have fun with this. Not to get in a fight or anything, but start going all out. Like I wear bright colored skinny jeans. Get some blue and purples ones or something. I am always putting interesting outfits together! Switch it up all the time. One day be really bright and dark, the other wear heels and a cute top. You sound like you could pull it off, and she wouldn't be able too.    But don't confront her, she will just get mad and the whole situation would be even more annoying.|`|jNwkgcTCaa	If I were you, I would have kicked her @ss, but I don't think you'd want to do that.  So just stop hanging out with her and stop talking to her altogether.|`|GWXTiE1Taa	shes your cousin, just tell her what shes doing and she'll probably understand|`|n1mwxljzaa	hahah make it into a competition, just try to outdo her in everything, like try to dress adorable everytime you see her so she will feel stupid if you two go to the mall & shes the one that looks gross and like a bum.|`|oU1yUxwwaa	I had a problem like that. just start wearing things that she wouldn't wear oe don't take her anywhere with you. But you can also just let her know that she is being a copycat and not making her own style just following you that she is just being a follower and that you are the leader.|`|2xAfgcNwaa	hahaaa i'd make it into a game and always try to out do HER.    make sure you look adorable everytime you're around her and wear clothes that she'd look like a total idiot in but you would look great in    hahaa good luck
0ebeadfc05507c25a34209b1ae74798aaa	Me and my husband have been married for 3 yrs and been TTC since May 08 and we found abt 2 weeks ago we were pregnant after 2 rounds of clomid. I was beyond exited, I could not believe it, I was soooo happy. Last friday my dreams were shattered. I just had my third miscarriage. I just want to die. I feel helpless, worthless, I'm constantly crying and I dont know what to do. I feel like I'm going crazy that's all I think about and seeing pregnant people all around me make me want to die more. The only thing that is helping now is my husband support and I've been praying a lot.  I'm soo sorry about your miscarriage I wish you luck on future pregnancies.|`|cBMwHdn4aa	So very sorry to hear of your misfortune.  I had one at about 12 weeks a couple of years ago.  I felt very empty inside, very depressed and guilty.  I thought I done something to cause it.  All of that is very natural and you'd be a little wacky if you didn't feel emotional.      Your hormones, for one, are going to be out of whack for a while, so be prepared for a ride on the emotional roller coaster.  You can always get professional help and talk it through, but what really consoled me was this...if you can still believe that there is a god...especially after what's just happened to you, know that he's taken the child for a reason.  Perhaps there was something so wrong that the child wouldn't have survived or would have been deformed or in a state of unrelenting pain.    Know that all things happen for a reason.  That is vague and may seem useless to you now, but you may see later why it wasn't meant to be now.    I hope you find comfort soon and good luck.    ps.  I later married the person that I had a MC with and we now have a 3-mos. old baby, everything went normal and he's healthy.  I hope this helps.|`|BUEp2B9gaa	I'm so sorry for your loss.    I miscarried around 12 weeks, but I chose to let it  happen naturally.  It took a long time for me to get through it, but I did eventually get through it.    It was very hard for me because 3 other couples in my Sunday school class announced they were pregnant the same time I did.  I had to stay away from them a lot because i couldn't stand to see their growing bellies when mine should have been growing along with theirs.    I eventually had to go to counseling to work through it.  He suggested I go to a kind of memorial service for babies lost through miscarriage.  You could give your baby a name and ligt a candle in his/her memory (of course, it was too early to know if I had a boy or girl).  I ended up not going to that because my husband didn't want to go (I had a blighted ovum, so he figured I was "never really pregnant" and didn't have to take the grieving that far).  I wish I would have gone anyway just for me.    Bottom line is, you need to do what YOU need to do to get through this.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	i'm sorry about your loss that's horrible  i cried and felt so sad after i miscarried.  I didn't wanna know anything about babies or pregnant women because i hate to admit it i felt somewhat jealous :(    its takes time to get over it specially when you're further into the pregnancy  but you will.     The only thing that made me feel better was being around positive people and thinking that pregnancy wasn't meant to be for whatever reason God had.|`|NRJLdOwkaa	Mother of two.  First two pregnancies were perfect.  I've been pregnant twice since then but for some reason it's not working out for me either.  I felt pretty horrible both times but I try to keep focused on the fact that everything happens for a reason.  God won't give you what you can't handle.  So sorry for your loss.|`|AA11763588	When I saw my babies heart not beating anymore, I think I was kind of in shock, I was not emotional what so ever, the DR actually called me a few times that day to check on me.    The next day I was a wreck, I think it all hit me at once. I didn't have the D and C I chose to let it happen naturally. A few days later the baby came out and I saw it, which they told me I more than likely would not, the next two days I didn't leave my bed.    It will get better. Just take as much time as you need to heal, not only physically but emotionally.    I'm very sorry for your loss.|`|s6qgkfLxaa	I'm sorry for your loss... I know how you feel. I had eight miscarriages, and it was very rough.     In my opinion the best thing that helped me was to do was to cry. Talk to someone, if that helps. Just let it out and do whatever it is you need to do. It's times like these you have every right to take the time you need to let it out.    For myself, it was more of a spiritual thing. I just decided I needed to connect with something or someone "higher" than me to help me get through it.     The rest of the time, I started concentrating on myself. Doing the things that made me feel good about myself. Whatever that may be.|`|TGlWnFjxaa	Time is the only thing... Its hard. When you first find out your pregnant your happy and scared. I lost my baby just around the same time fame as you. I was hurt. All I was able to do was cry and move on. You'll always be hurt by the situation. If I went full term I would have a 2 year old now. It will always be there to haunt me. Talk to friends, eat some comfort food and try again.... Your not going to have a miscarage everytime you get pregnant. Also find out if you blood and the fathers are compatable... If not then you need to get a shot...  Sorry for your loss. Hope this helps you...
AA11885437	One year when money was slim my hubby and I stayed in, cooked a spaghetti dinner with salad and bread and we shared a bottle of red wine. It was one of the best valentines days I have ever had, maybe it was because it was so simple but we were able to spend time and focus on each other and it was incredibly romantic.|`|4U93EoUtaa	Don't know if this is what you want to hear, lol, but a nice meal, massage and then bj would put him over the moon.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	I know all of these answers are similar but make him his favorite dinner. Use candles and make it look romantic. Get creative and make him something cute and crafty. You can go to a crafts store and get creative there. You don't have to spend too much money.    massages in bed and if you are up for it some love makin'      ;)|`|rx0ekB9Paa	cook him his favorite meal and go get a good movie. trade massages all night.
LABC73E7aa	vitamin c, lots of fluids, keep warm.|`|AA11603810	Take a spoonful of Honey. and Lemon juice. - Home remedy for sore throats.|`|AA10080206	You probably can't take any kind of medication, but you can try gargling with salt water, drinking plenty of liquids (especially warm ones), and get lots of rest.|`|atzw0IP4aa	Just get as much rest as you can. Drink fluids, self care. Do not take meds or vitamins (airborn) without your dr.s ok as some are bad for you and the baby.|`|ul79DG2kaa	Two Tylenol every 6 hrs or so should help with the sore throat.  They are safe for you and baby.  It's what you will get in the hospital after baby's born for pain relief.  As for keeping the cold at bay... lots of fluids and bed rest before baby comes.  If you do get a cold and baby comes, really do forget about cleaning the house during baby's nap and just rest.
Kl1h5dCaaa	Keep walking. If it's makes them worse, and they are contractions (not hicks), it will speed up labour.    Good Luck Sweetie  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|82ORY9UFaa	Call your OB right now, that decision doesnt depends on people on Yahoo Answers, but your doctor ! Im pretty sure its time ;) Good luck on the delievery!|`|I7myOp8Qaa	Follow the 411 rule- contractions every 4 minutes apart or less, lasting at least a minute etec. Also , if walking makes your contractions worse and makes them stronger then this is probably true labor. You may not want to waste gas but you dont want to have the baby in the car either.|`|bd206b850f2fec243858724c57950888aa	You should definitely call your OB or head over to L&D... When I was pregnant with my first son, my contractions didn't feel painful at all (I even needed a nurse to tell me when I was having them) and I walked into my 37 week appointment 5cm dilated 80% effaced... who knew?|`|MsipL0Mzaa	i dont think they are hard enough...wait until you can say ....oh this is labor....then youll know....some of my contractions have taken my breath away...but its not true labor...you can go in but they might just send you back home....|`|TQW5E6olaa	I'd call the DR, that's what they're paid for, bug her.    Given how quick babies come in your family, I'd rather waste gas...and eat out :)|`|4AO2myzKaa	I would go in, you may just have a really high pain tolerance, and it would be better for you not to deliver on the kitchen table.  Good luck meeting your baby tonight!  =)|`|YBQvzEhGaa	Try drinking a glass of water and see if that stops them.  If not, I would eat dinner and then go.  try this website http://www.contractionmaster.com/ to time them.  I loved it when I was pregnant!  Good luck!|`|0BC2WTyoaa	I would go in or at least call the Dr.  When I had my daughter (first baby) I never felt my contractions at all.  So it's better to be safe than sorry.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	Do not eat if you think your in labor it might cause you to trow up! I would say that if they become regular or more pain full you better go|`|pVWk12oOaa	they are close enough together, GO!  stop somewhere close to  the hospital for a bite to eat first, you'll need the energy! good luck!|`|2f7d753df622c9c42a37e136f0451cb6aa	when you cant carry a conversation on because of the contractions then go to the hospital.  If you can keep on talking without having to break because it hurts then you are fine.|`|98WKYtfwaa	You should phone up your midwife/obgyn or whoever is looking after you, tell them what you're feeling and they'll be able to tell you whether to go in or not. Like you said, you don't want to go a 30min + drive and it being a false alarm.    Contractions can be just back pain and not strong for some people btw. If you're told to go in then you can make something and take it with you eat it on the way.     Good luck! X|`|veO1RXrCaa	Eat if you can.  You will need your strength.  I had a big lunch before I was induced with my son.  But keep an eye on your contractions.  Don't dily dally about them.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	You might have some time because they are not so painful, but if it were me and the contractions were that close together I would go into labor and delivery. Even if it's just a false alarm then at least you know. If you are in labor they can give you pitosin to make the contractions stronger and more even. Good luck and hope that baby comes soon!!! Keep us updated!|`|myEwHgI1aa	Hang out at home for as long as possible, eat dinner, rest, walk around...do what feels the most comfortable. When you feel you can not wait any longer, then go to hospital.|`|sOYUCM1vaa	I agree with 'j'. If you can't carry a conversation because you have to pause for the pain, you should go in. I would go in soon if they don't subside. have a small snack too. I did when I was in labour! Also, your waters may not break with a huge splash like on the movies. I had what they called a 'hindquarter trickle' where I barely noticed the waters. The pain sent me in, but I was surprised when they said I was in early labour as my waters had indeed broken!|`|AA10953561	Follow the 1-5-1 rule, generally. If your contractions last 1 minute long and are coming every 5 (or less) minutes for 1 hour then it's time to go to the hospital.    It's a good rule of thumb. Good luck!
sw2R5A9iaa	the child should never know this info.|`|AA10730513	She would probably adore her father because he gives her attention. ... Little kids do like financial security. But even more important is to know that they are loved and thought of often.|`|hP7AiUyPaa	i think its nice that this little girl sees her daddy its very important for them , well the problems that happen in  the relationship shoulnt be taken out on any child and both parents should try to be there for the child, as for the dad just cause the law doesnt allow it,(where is this dad again) he should just help this mom he shouldnt have to be force to pay he should do it so that mom stay away from welfare.|`|bnPufBlAaa	did you read what you wrote, it made me dizzy..., either the law forbids child support which does not make sence or the mother does not take him for it however if she is on welfare they will go after him...No problem...|`|2jMFurDoaa	ive seen alot of your questions and i read thru the rest of them and i must say i am rather confused.    are you just making up scenarios or something?|`|5CnFXw4Zaa	eventually the kid will find out and in time, she will hold him accountable on this point. She will still love him but it will be a sticking point
vKEYa8aeaa	im 18 and my husband is 23 and were expecting in april. as long as you are ready and can financially/emotionally support a child and all of their needs then you are ready. good luck! =]|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	that's good. I think a good age to get a pregnant is between 23-36. You should be married for a few years [2 or 3].|`|zSABr7praa	23 with bachelors degrees, savings, and no student loans?!  You must tell me your secrets, lol.  I'm 21 and my husbands 24.  We're both done with school, and felt the time was right.  I think it actually is a GREAT idea to plan for your future.. but I don't think there's a magic age to have babies.|`|y71F17T4aa	yes i think that is a good age. i am going to be 25 years old and i have an almost 3 year old and 1 on the way in the summer!  so good luck! as long as u and the future father to be are cdapable of nurturing and taking care of (financially and emotionally) then go ahead!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I think 23 would be a good age. Especially if you guys are well off in life and are stable.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	23 is a great time to start having kids. i'm only 22 and i'm on my 2nd pregnancy..    but you're right, planning never works. i planned on college and a bunch of other stuff before i had kids. but it didn't happen that way for me.    now here i am, no college degree. a stay at home mom and an army wife. its not a bad life. i love it!!!|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Hey, if everything works out for you then go for it! My mom was 24 when she gave birth to me and we just celebrated her 50th birthday and my wedding this past summer (I'm 26).|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	When I was a kid I thought I would have graduated with my degree, gotten married, and had a kid but he time I was 23 too. I think we had the same plan. But I'm just now married at 28, pregnant, and looking for a house. You can't plan these things it just happens.     But to answer your question, yes, I think 23 is a good age. My sister had endomitriosis, tried for 2 years at 33 to have a kid without luck, had corrective surgery, and now has 2 kids at 35.|`|GDobAMQ8aa	Age takes a back seat to financial and emotional stability, when it comes to having a kid.  23 is a good age to set as a goal, but if, somehow, 23 comes around and you still don't have a stable job or enough money (or if you've not matured as much as you thought), then you may want to put it off for another year or two.|`|sOYUCM1vaa	I had my first daughter when I was 20 years, due to same reasons. Our son is now 6 years old. We have a 12 yr old and a 6 yr old. I'm glad I had my kids at a young age, as I loved children and wanted to be active with them. We have been trying for our 3rd for 3 months. We liked the idea of 6 yrs apart each but are finding it more difficult to conceive the 3rd, as we'd expected. Glad we didn't wait longer. 23 is not too young. You sound like you have good organisation skills and plans. Even if things didn't work out with you r partner ( hope they do ), you still have your precious little baby, your health and good career prospects. Go for it!|`|McRoWQrAaa	as long you are ready and able to take   care of a child in every way then yes  it is a good age to get pregnant :)|`|9d9b8b9e4972c1f3e7d9b9e80936b200aa	As long as you are married and financially stable, I don't see a problem with it.  That sounds likes a good age, specifically with your endometriosis|`|I7myOp8Qaa	You seem like a mature and responsible person and have plans worked out with regards to graduating from college etc. I would say, have a baby when you are ready. This includes having a steady job, having money put away in savings, being in a steady relationship etc. Do keep in mind however, how much ever you plan, things CAN and DO go wrong.I am a planner like you and my husband and I had excellent jobs. We planned for a baby thinking our future was secure. On the day we found out we were pregnant we also lost our jobs. So anything can happen. Just make sure that you and your partner are fully committed and can accept some unexpected things and circumstances.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I'm 22 but got pregnant at 21 because I have endometriosis and cysts so my doctor said if I wait too long it may be impossible to conceive.  I got lucky with twins so at least if I can't get pregnant again I'll have two kids!  It's not so much the age that is a big factor, but the stability of your relationship with the the father and your financial situation.  If it's what the two of you want, go for it!|`|CLcGxHpAaa	You're too young too be this concerned about your future family.  With all the planning and worrying you are doing you will be surprised that things are not going to be as easy as planned.  Enjoy life, let things come as they may.  Personally, I think 23 is too young.  You are a young adult, barely out of college.|`|03f100b7d34df8ee17796e093fefa637aa	I met my husband when I was 16.....we were married when I was 19....bought a house when I was 20....pregnant when I was 21 and the baby will be born when I am 22.  Both of us have great jobs and feel we are steady enough in our lives to bring this baby in this world.  I think the age you decide to become pregnant isn't what matters.  I think it is how financially prepared you are and how prepared you are mentally and emotionally for a baby.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I think 23 is a good age    I just turned 20 and my husband is 21 and we are expecting our daughter to arrive in April|`|sa0EwdvEaa	i was 23 when i had my first kid, it was a very good age, i think the 20s are the best age actually...my body didnt go to crap and i look great even now, actually i look better and my belly got NO stretch marks and looks great right now!  i think now is the perfect time if you are mentally ready to basically stop being selfish and give your life over to a kid, once you have a kid you cannot do whatever you want anymore when you want...but yeah 23 is a good age.|`|SKqV374maa	don't have kids there a pain in the ***|`|xHq5jfNtaa	Hi,  I'm an organizer and plan ahead as well! You certainly sound very mature and hard-working. If you really want children, you really love your partner and there is a real chance that you could not become pregnant later in life, then it would probably be a good idea to consider having a child at 23. Ask the advice of your family and friends.|`|jn34aSgHaa	i think that would be a good age me and my husbad had a baby when i was 19 and he was 23 and we are happy so i think that 23 is just fine good luck!!|`|bd206b850f2fec243858724c57950888aa	I think 23 is a great age to have a baby!  I was married at 19 got pregnant two months after our elopement and had my first baby at 20.  I wish I could have finished school and had a little time being married to my husband and had a little more money in the bank, but having my son has been such a warming experience.  I am glad I had him young, because I'll be a young mother and a young empty nester... Think about it, he'll be out of my house and off to college when I'm 38!  I had to put a few things on hold, but I'll reap  the benefits in the long run!|`|gwUMipsUaa	23 is just fine if you are married.|`|4AO2myzKaa	Well, it's not so much the age as where you are in life.  I'd say if you are married, and have a good financial footing then go for it!  Also, if possible give yourself and your spouse at least a year of marriage before getting pregnant as it will give you more time to bond and do "couple things" and not be dragged down by a heavy baby.
222b275605b13f67cc62d39dde66821baa	Yes.  It's pretty painful and "crampy" feeling.  Things could be moving along or they might not.  Not the answer you were looking for I know:).  But really none of us can tell if the baby is making it's way or not. The feelings you are having are normal...whether you have the baby today or not...
yZWhgvgHaa	I know i was so hot when i was pregnant with my son.. but not so much with this pregnancy. I just feel normal.     I wouldn't base whether or not you are pregnant just because you've been hot lately though. Hormonal changes of all kinds have different and weird side effects.    Sooooooo good luck on Saturday when you test... hope you get the answer you are hoping for!!!|`|QJDbG1F1aa	Yes, I was hot until I delivered. Having a quart of cold ice water next to your bed helps. You will have to pee, but you will keep cool.|`|HoJ1pLtraa	it is pregnancy related because your body picks up a different body temp when your pregnant|`|NQQaoG8Oaa	yes, and i could never get comfy|`|7cvoxQitaa	LMAO!! My husband hated me when I would sleep at night!! The AC would be on 50! I would have 3 fans blowing on me at full speed, it still wasn't enough to cool me off! He would walk around the house with a jacket on, and take it off when he would leave for work! He said it was so cold in the house, I couldn't get it cold enough!    Good luck!|`|bZBByJAAaa	Lately, I go to sleep not feeling hot and wake up a few hours later sweating. It's so weird. I guess it's a normal thing. Hormones.|`|jiFXPCyUaa	i explained it to my six year old son, that mommy is so hot now because she is an incubator for the new baby. keeping it warm and safe so it can grow. my husband tells me i'm just a hormonal mess...(nice of him huh?!!) lol|`|ul79DG2kaa	Yes, during both my pregnancies.  With my 1st it went away after she was born.  My second is now 18 mos. and I still am way to hot.  I even had hot flashes every time I breastfed her.  I would start to sweat about 30 sec. to 1 min. before she would wake up to feed, and it would last the whole time and for about 10 minutes after.  About 30 min total.  Now I rarely use a blanket, but I do get cold once in a while.|`|5793e96405109506ce7e9f6a4ff6ce46aa	YES!! i used to be sooo hot and would open the window sometimes while my poor hubby froze with 2 covers on LOL  BABY DUST TO YOU XXX|`|8be367fe78353833dcfd48377d2502ecaa	CERTAINLY pregnancy related.  You have increased hormones and blood flow in your body!  I'm pregnant for the fourth time...and I'm always much warmer.  (except my feet)|`|rQXVbNGWaa	i cant de a pregnacy i am 13 years old and i always sleep under the covers|`|TGlWnFjxaa	It is a pregnacy symptom. When I was pregnant (early on) I was hot and cold when I hit 2 months I was hot and sleeping wiith only a thin sheet.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	i have always been one of those people that can always sleep with a blanket.    since pregnancy i sleep with no blanket which is really odd for me and i couldnt sleep with the fan on.  now i cant sleep without it.    might be something to do with pregnancy body does change  god bless x|`|AA11763588	Yep... I have the heat on, but I have the ceiling fan on as well, I need the cold air to hit my feet or I can't sleep.|`|zhrGiQsKaa	i felt that way too. it is normal. i was always hot.|`|4lpJRXYsaa	yes it is very common|`|VUss5AfAaa	yes always hot at night and had to sleep with a fan.  and still am.  one more week till im due.  feb 14  boy /38wks/5days
AA10624857	The Adolescent section is found under the category of Pregnancy and Parenting. I think all the sections listed under the Pregnancy and Parenting heading are intended to categorize the questions into subsets specific to age groups. So, the Preschool and Toddler section is not a place for the 2-4 age group children to post questions any more than the Adolescent section is for teens to post questions. I believe the initial intent was for the Adolescent section to field questions from parents about issues with their adolescent age children. I don't think it should be a place for teens to post questions about things like homework or a problem with their computer since there are separate categories for those, but if teens have questions specific to their age group I think posting questions there is fine as long as they understand that parents and other adults are just as likely to answer as kids their own age. I don't think any one group should hold claim to the category, but I do feel that the questions should be limited to specific adolescent issues.|`|AGaT3BDMaa	Mostly teens and then a bunch of adult who think that what they say to us might change our minds on something... Sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't. I would also throw in some concerned parents(LMAO)|`|drI1vsJdaa	Teens, with a mix of adults.|`|R47Bj9Q6aa	teens mainly now  theres nowhere else really for us to go  parents can go to the parenting section or ask here  but us teens wouldnt really ask any questions in the parenting section so this has kinda became our own section  i  know this section started out for parents but the teens took it over but we really need our own whole section I believe  with subsections like pregnancy, friendship, relationship, health, drugs and then just a fun section where we can ask poll type questions and stuff|`|0xiHNsmVaa	Most teens here ask questions about themselves. I wonder if the baby section has babies asking questions about themselves?|`|1gVDZrPuaa	Teens at 95% and adults at 5%.|`|L8qpPXsdaa	I would say mostly teens with a hint of adults.  99(teens)-1(adults).|`|0WstfAmzaa	I think most of the questions found in this section are by teenagers, and younger ones at that. Some are by parents, but they seem to prefer the Parenting section to the Adolescents.  I would probably go with 1.32 adults - 98.68 teenagers.
28fNd725aa	My first labor was only about 4 hrs... and delivery was a pinch!! My second was easier!!  Only in labor for a 1.5 and only 3 pushes and there she was!!      Good luck on that  2 if you decide to go for it!
wzXJOSIeaa	Sounds like he's spending a lot of extra one on one time with you. Maybe you should be answering this question for us!|`|838VJJGvaa	Tell her you are trying to learn how dance and helps you for the talent show.  Tell her it is okay.|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	Doesnt sound like it to me, but I can see where she is coming from...|`|e999e7de922e3571d326c032bb6fda4aaa	I can see where she gets it, but I would be completely creeped out if he wanted me to dance with him...|`|58eHufb3aa	That is a lil weird, but i understand why u spend alot of time together.
T1hZG4O3aa	Its very possible and everyone is different. If you notice when you wake up that your stomach is small than, and bigger during hte rest of the day, than its bloating. But if when you wake up your stomach is big throughout the entire day its probably that you are showing. It is possible. With my daughter I didnt show until I was 5 months pregnant. This time around I started showing right off the bat. Every woman is different and every pregnancy is different. Good luck.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    possible swelling from adjusting hormones in body.    bubs is still very small.    God Bless x all the best - anything is possible.|`|T48smu01aa	at 6 weeks your just bloated....but everyone is different alot of people told me I shouldn't be showing at 14-15 weeks but I was its b/c I am short haha so my stomach popped faster anyways your probably bloated as of now but don't worry it happens quick enjoy what you have now!! :)  Congrats and good luck!!!|`|cBMwHdn4aa	yes. it always depends on the person and with the pregnancy.  with my 2nd i had a pooch at abt. 6 wks.  it's not so much the uterus--or that teeny-weenie baby, probably extra fluids retained due to hormones.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	probably not. I didnt really start showing until 15 week or so. It might be wishful thinking. I couldnt wait for my baby bump to show up!
U0KCmsKXaa	Haha -- very funny.|`|glGVuKAEaa	Um...|`|yNxYYHszaa	Mike Rotch- sounds like my crotch  Hugh Jass- sounds like huge a**  Eileen Dover- i leaned over|`|viwq8ldvaa	I quite like Ben Dover & Wayne Kerr !!|`|cFPQVavVaa	hahahaha|`|uFhQqxCXaa	I love the name Mike, but Rotch? I mean seriously? That name makes me think of a **** rotch! but spelled roach!   You CAN NOT name your baby Hugh Jass! That is just mean. I really like the name Jass though! Maybe a different name fir the 1st. Maybe Simon  Eileen is so pretty Iove it. Dover is nice too. But together it sounds like I leaned over lol|`|YseGAHIfaa	HAHAHAHA...    COK GUZEL!|`|oxWpo4bqaa	I have a Hugh Jass.|`|ylgNuE3uaa	har har har... :-P  lol|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	hilarious!|`|3MVv1uOaaa	hahahahhaha   what about Ben Dover?|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	Assuming that you're not having a joke moment, stay with recognizable names. Michael on birth certificate, not Dover because it's male, Jass will get Jas spelling, Eileen is nice but a girl needs a softer sound....is Hugh outdated? And what's the surname? (funny or not) Good luck, mom!|`|RqOET8pnaa	I would go with Mike Hunt|`|MtoIxY6Qaa	hahaahahhahaahahahahahaahahahahahhahahah...  OMG IM GONNA PEE MY PANTS FROM LAUGHING SO HARD!!!|`|b4IK780Raa	No, no, no, no, no!!!!|`|6BdI1xnPaa	Very funnny!!!
uvFB5Qdzaa	Time the pain. Once it hit every 5-3 min apart go to the hospital.|`|4U93EoUtaa	Pelivc pressure probably means contractins are forcing baby's head down.  Call your doctor!    I had BH for weeks with my 3rd, and when I finally went into labor it went FAST.  Don't wait, call.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	time your contractions.  when they get to about 4 minutes apart, get to the hospital!|`|7cvoxQitaa	Time them... 3-6 minutes you need to go!!!! Be careful if you are losing fluid as well since the mucus plug is gone. You don't want all the amniotic fluid draining out, that is not a good thing!!! Call your doctor or midwife... heck even staff at the hospital that you are going to be delivering at if you feel they are 3-6 minutes apart, or if you feel like you are losing too much fluid!|`|d1csiCLKaa	Sit down and relax with a cup of tea, time the minutes inbetween the pains. When the reach 5 minutes apart call your dr or the hospital and tell them whats going on.    The pelvic pressure is the babies head moving down and getting itself ready to greet the world.    The main thing is to try and stay calm.    Good luck!!!|`|3yzpx3HSaa	I am a mother of 5 and using my husbands account. the pressure you fill is the babies head or but if breach go to the hospital NOW or at very least call your Dr.
O4JuH8zmaa	I've had two miscarriages as well and now I have a healthy baby girl. From what I read when I was going through this I believe it's almost as common to miscarry twice as it is to miscarry once but it is far less common to miscarry a third time. Does it make sense the way I worded that? That comforted me the third time I got pregnant (which I carried to term). So hang in there. Trust me when I say I know how you feel. You'll probably be a little extra stressed the next few weeks but soon you'll be in that glorious second trimester and you'll feel like you can finally breathe! So good luck and don't worry, you will make it without going completely crazy!    ETA: I added the link. What I meant about the third miscarriage is that it is less common to have three miscarriages than one or two and your chances of having another after having two do go up a little but don't go up drastically until you've had three. That's why they typically do not test you for too many things that could be causing them until you've had three. I didn't complete my thought earlier.... Anyway Dr. Sears explains it better. Good luck again!|`|ykP7I3caaa	Get a lot of rest, drink a lot of fluid and try not to stress. I was worried about miscarriage too but you have to think positive. Worrying will not help! If it's meant to happen there's nothing you can do to stop it, just means the baby couldn't come together right. So just hope for the best. Best of luck, and eat the best you can/take prenatals.|`|MOsStEbqaa	Your percentage always goes up when you have a miscarriage. All you can do now is not stress and do all the right things. Praying also works. Good Luck.|`|90zcKChJaa	worry = stress. Try as hard as it may be to just relax and not think about being pregnant 24/7. You can not stress about the things in life you can not control.    Take it easy and drink a lot of water! ;) Good luck!|`|QNZM0ONdaa	dont worry about it. i think that you and your baby will be perfectly fine!  your baby will turn out to be a strong healthy baby :)|`|a86IJoFjaa	I had a miscarriage when I was 19, I was 16 weeks along. It was terrifying.   I carried my daughter full term and she was born March last year.  I just miscarried at 3 weeks over the summer and now I'm 14 weeks pregnant.  It really really depends on the woman and the pregnancy.|`|0ebeadfc05507c25a34209b1ae74798aaa	Common but unlikely. Have you done testing to find out why you are miscarrying? When you go to the doctor have them do hormonal testing to see if your hormone levels are ok. I just did some test so they can find out what is wrong with me cuz I just had my third miscarriage and I feel so helpless.|`|HoJ1pLtraa	Just don't stress too much and continue eating normal and drink and eat a lot of fruits the more you stress the misscarriage I think you should just let it flow  and wish for the best this time|`|nx2HhWNtaa	God !!! one of these messages is terrible some people are sick !, don't worry, relax and try not to think or stress too much. That's the worse thing you can do. Enjoy and be happy and RELAX...    I too have experienced a miscarriage not nice..    Good Luck sweet !|`|0Id85yiYaa	don't stress! do things that are good for your baby: light exercise, getting enough sleep, eating right, etc.    i had a miscarriage, and my doc told me that it doesn't mean that you will have fertility problems in the future.     congrats!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey,    im sorry this has happened to you darling.  But im not sure how common it is.     but i do want to say - Congratulations & Keep your head high. its normal to worry.  but dont ever loose hope. keep strong. You will be holding bub in Sept!    god bless|`|UYfqzCoMaa	It's actually not very common to miscarrya second time. Have they checked you out to make sure that your body can handle a baby? I will pray for you in hopes that your baby will be safe and that this precious angel will make it the full nine months. Take care and if you need any support feel free to email me. You can do that from my profile. Good luck hon and god bless you.|`|AA11763588	The more you have the higher your percentage goes up.     I know it's hard, but you have to stay positive right now.     Don't stress, as stress can trigger a miscarriage. Drink plenty of water, keep up on any meds the DR gave you. Don't do anything strenuous right now.    Good luck!
bc5jGZ0uaa	I'm not sure about that, but my OB told me after my car accident that if nothing happened within the first 4 hours afterwards then most likely everything will be ok.  I over did it this weekend doing chores and was really sore, even around my belly, but after a day or so of rest everything is back to normal- well as normal as it's going to be for the next few months anyways.|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	Varies completely on the person and how badly you over exerted yourself and also where the baby happened to be sitting at the time. Sometimes signs show straight away and sometimes they take a while. If you are worried go to the doctor.|`|4U93EoUtaa	Could be short or long.  Call your doctor!!!!!
39e92f6342252994a40c04b1fb383e9daa	5-6 wks into the pregnancy    How your baby's growing: Deep in your uterus your embryo is growing at a furious pace. At this point he's about the size of a sesame seed, and he looks more like a tiny tadpole than a human. He's now made up of three layers  the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm  that will later form his organs and tissues. The cells are forming for his major organs, including his kidneys and liver, and his neural tube is beginning to develop. This neural tube  from which your baby's brain, spinal cord, nerves, and backbone will sprout  develops in the top layer, called the ectoderm. This layer will also give rise to his skin, hair, nails, mammary and sweat glands, and tooth enamel. His heart and circulatory system begin to form in the middle layer, or mesoderm. (This week, in fact, his tiny heart begins to divide into chambers and beat and pump blood.) The mesoderm will also form your baby's muscles, cartilage, bone, and subcutaneous (under skin) tissue. The third layer, or endoderm, will house his lungs, intestines, and rudimentary urinary system, as well as his thyroid, liver, and pancreas. In the meantime, the primitive placenta and umbilical cord, which deliver nourishment and oxygen to your baby, are already on the job.    Note: Every baby develops a little differently  even in the womb. Our information is designed to give you a general idea of your baby's development|`|3685fdeae86a81346f3b588f28ed00feaa	www.babycentre.co.uk|`|b64f9b7638645b88c4f0e53ebba5ae29aa	The central nervous system is being developed very early on - in the 1st trimester mostly.  It starts within the first few weeks and then during the 1st trimester an enormous amount of neurons are born, migrate to the location they will be, and start specializing into the specific type of neuron they will be.  In the 2nd trimester some of this continues and then synapse formation begins in earnest (connecting up the different parts to each other).  The forming connections and refining the connectivity continues even after birth and into the 1st year or so.|`|832d9aa8900843f4e206c2900d5535c5aa	i do believe that it is in the first weeks after it was conceived, even before you know that you are pregnant|`|AA12088692	http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/facts/fetus...|`|AA11001832	As far as i am aware a baby is FULLY developed at 12 weeks, they are just a miniature version of themselves and spend the next 6 months just growing. That is why it is vitally important to have a correct diet in the first trimester, as well as taking folic acid supplements and avoiding alcohol, caffeine and smoking. They can move, cry (silently), dream and can feel pain at this stage too. That is why people are so anti-abortion for mums who are over 12 weeks pregnant.|`|e7f3c51b58b76024b96bc191d7cab4afaa	i have no idea but conception pregnancy and birth by dr.miriam stoppard is a really good book to show how a baby developes after conception month by month until you pop!!

Ethan: Ethan thomas is ok. nothing great. try to make the middle name a little more unique to keep the name not so bland.    Maddox: people will no doubt think u copied brad/angelina and it doesnt sound good with thomas  Wesley: i love this. it could go with a cute baby face, and also when he's older. i think this sounds good with vo  Xavier or Zavier: alot of people like this name, but i personally dont. can u picture looking into the eyes of a cute innocent chubby baby and calling it xavier?  Lucas: nooo  Elliot: nooooo  Aiden: i've always loved this name, its ok if its common. it sounds good with vo    my family friends last name is Lo. their names are rylee giselle lo. im not too crazy about the middle name but rylee lo sounds good. the other girl is alessandra lo. idk her middle name. and they hav a boy mason ryder lo. mason lo sounds good. again...middle name kinda annoys me    just dont get too worked up about middle names cuz no one ever rly calls them by their full name|`|MtoIxY6Qaa	olivia~ omg ik! i was talking 2 haylee 3day @ skl and shes like: ya i loove alli and im like omg u r a big fawt joke alli... shews like: so r u janie!! im like: CURSE U!!!

Other options:  Emmaline  Camille    Wade  Judah|`|boqwvEvUaa	I like Evangeline, Evelyn, and Elaina ;)   for boys, Xavier Thomas Vo and Elliot Thomas Vo would be cute. ooh, and I think if you combine two of the first names you listed--Ethan Maddox Vo sounds good too ;)
98WKYtfwaa	Each month you ovulate from each ovary.     One month it'll be left, the other it'll be right.|`|F8iYNurEaa	You ovulate from both ovaries but alternate each month (left ovary, right ovary, left ovary, right ovary etc).|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	Usually each ovary relases an egg (sometimes more if on fertilty drugs) once a month. So each ovary alternates. For example you might ovulate on the left side one month and then the next month your right ovary will release an egg.  Some women can get their period and not ovulate at all.|`|myEwHgI1aa	Both. It alternates from side to side each cycle.
d1027f6834f2f2660c8aa9290737073eaa	With both of my pregnancies I was woke up in the middle of the night/ early morning in labor. With my first baby, my hubby didn't believe me and told me just to time my contractions. I was mad since we live almost 2 hours away from the hospital! I was 4 days over the first time and almost a week over the second pregnancy.|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	i began feeling very small contraction while i was still in bed but didn't think much of them, but later on i was at a friends house eating dinner and they came on strong!! i had to lay on her floor dealing with the pain.  i was 38 weeks|`|83526d824d95bdede455e1f500079e1daa	I was opening the curtains on the sliding glass door in my room to see the rain when my water broke. It broke the day before my scheduled c-section. I was 38 weeks. My baby was 9lbs, 1oz.
QJDbG1F1aa	Your uterus does stretch. Also the baby implanting into the uterus will cause cramping. Your body from the time you conceive until the time you delivery your body will always go through changes and cramping is one of the major symptoms.|`|HoJ1pLtraa	I could be 3 weeks and I haven't been experiencing any cramping feeling but idk|`|4lpJRXYsaa	your uterus is actually slightly stretching to make room for when the baby grows
wyAtVqbOaa	He's moved.  When your tummy feels hard it's most likely that he has his back to your tummy but when it feels soft, his back is to your back.      Don't worry, this wont be like this for long as the space in your uterus won't be so much when he grows.      Good luck and congratulations|`|iR9w7d7Yaa	Hi,  Your baby has probably moved. I am nearly 19 weeks pregnant and my baby is lay sideways and hasn't moved from this position in weeks! (i know this because i have been having weekly scans).  My stomach and lower addomen are really soft too!  Don't worry everything is fine!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    yes most likely darling.  They like to move where ever they feel comfortable darling. Thats were they go.    god bless x|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	im 20 weeks with a boy and he moves like that all the time. no worries. congrats.|`|sXCSVFBaaa	That will happen a lot. Chances are your baby just moved, especially if you can still feel him moving. My lower abdomen fluctuates between normal & hard, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.
9Y9K7qDTaa	Yeah, you can definitely spot when you're pregnant.  It's called implantation & usually occurs about a week before your expected period.   Uhm, cravings this early? I doubt that .. but being tired is definitely one of the first signs because your body is preparing for 9 long months.  But, implantation is NOT actual blood. It's brown/light pink discharge & does not turn into blood or anything heavy.  Cramping, headaches & bloating are also common early pregnancy signs.  But, your period could just be coming because those are also pms symptoms.   You're period could just be a bit late, which is totally normal too. If you don't get your period within the next week then I suggest definitely taking a test.  Best of luck sweetie.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	EPT!  EPT!  EPT!
lOuiQm4Saa	oh, come on. GO AND GET HER ONE. (emercencies, hello!)    ...but there are some things-    -give her limited time on talking  -pay half the bill and have her pay the other side so that it's even and she knows about frugality  -make sure she knows what she is doing (i.e. nothing bad)|`|Sl9ybZT7aa	Make sure her grades are good and she doing everything she told at home then give her one so that way when she show out you can take it.|`|58eHufb3aa	Well my mum's rule is;  You get a cell phone once you either get a job or  get involved in alot of after school events.  And i think that's realistic.  11, why the **** would she need one in the first place?  to be honest. =\|`|PYSMK0JBaa	I got one for my son at 10 because he has after school activities and also, school was let out early due to weather one day and the school couldn't find MY cell phone info. He was stuck at school for an hour while I frantically tried to get to him after hearing on the radio that school was being let out early. That did it for me. Now, if anything like that happens again, he can call me himself instead of relying on the school. (He hadn't memorized my cell  )|`|L8qpPXsdaa	It depends how you are giving it to her.  It teaches a great amount of responsibility, especially if you make her pay part if the bill.  But, if she is an immature brat like most 11 year olds, then no, don't let her have the privilege.|`|Dil6DihTaa	As long as she is responsible I would say it's fine. I was 11 when I got my first cell phone. (:|`|gAPwYArkaa	No!  im 14, i got a cell phone when i was 11, and it was all i wanted only because i could show it off to my friends, none of my friends had cell phones and i barely used it, it was a huge HUGE waste of money on my parents part, then 1 year later i wanted a cooler phone.  so no, 11 is too young because the only reason she wants it is to show it of, she may say other wise but i can almost guarentee it!  so i would say wait till highschool, (grade 9)  11 is way to young.  or give her a cell phone for her grade 8 graduation present, if she gets good marks, it will give her something to work for!  :)  hope i helped.|`|kmmlc4m7aa	well .  if you think she is responsible enuff to have a fone then.. yea  but right about now shee only wants a fone bcuhz her freinds have 1 .   i wuld let her wait until shee gets out of that.   until she wants 1 bcuhz she needs 1|`|vBahPYJGaa	i think that is a good age if she is mature enough|`|lTsPX04jaa	16 when she gets a car.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Unless she has LOTS or after school/before school/out of school activities PLUS public transport, no. She does not need one.|`|U0KCmsKXaa	Don't let her pressure you into it.  My son won't be getting a cell phone until he's old enough to drive.  Until then there is absolutely no reason for him to have a phone.|`|cLgghhuXaa	YOU know your daughter better than anyone else... I personally think 11 is too young! MAYBE 12! I personally would wait til high school (9th grade/freshman/14) WHY do they need one before high school?     ****In high school... they have a job to pay for extra charges... in high school... they get their license and may need to call for help... in high school kids are in a lot of activities that don't require you picking them up...    ****Is your daughter responsible enough not to lose it or break it? (or have it stolen cause she was showing off?) Does she have restraint to avoid overrages? (Why can't she just use a landline to call her friends?) Does she have good grades?  (No use rewarding bad grades/behavior!)    *Edit: the majority of the SURE and YES's are coming from jr. high students I am sure...|`|838VJJGvaa	yeah.  when i was her age i got mine for after school rides and safety.  If she doesn't need one get her a cheap one.|`|d5K8wORqaa	my sister only got one cause she plays basketball and volley ball and soccer and softball|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Eleven is very young. They won't understand the concept of the bill nor being responsible when using it. Just cause her friends have it, doesn't mean she should have it. She just wants to fit in. If she wants a cell phone, she can wait until she can afford one. Its an excellent way for teens to learn the whole paying bills, and being careful about wasting. So when they move out, they have some experience with being responsible with money. ??|`|cFPQVavVaa	11 is an appropriate age to get a cell phone.|`|5wilVKEdaa	I know kids who are 16 and don't have them.  They survive.|`|jPlUycx0aa	Sure its a good age.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	my parents didnt get me one until i was about 12 or 13...even then i didnt EVER use it, i just thought it was cool to have it. i dont think i talked on it once, it was pointless really. i got my next one when i was almost 15 and i actually used it and needed it then [since my cousin was 16 and she drove, we hung out alot so they needed to know where i was at/going]|`|y3u5WYDMaa	very appropriate    when u where a kid it was new technology so no offence but that doesnt count|`|gdvCvWrLaa	i got my first cell phone when i was in 7th grade. not really sure how that old is.    be careful though. if you are trying to give into what she wants when she says "all my friends have one" it might not be good  later when she says "but mom all my friends are doing it"    but i would say get her the cell phone.  she'll feel on top of things. and like she's a hot shot.|`|AGaT3BDMaa	Yeah I think so. I am 15( don't look over my answer cuz of my age please) I have found it to be very helpful with keeping in touch with my parents. I love being in touch with my friends too duhh but my mom lets me go out cuz she knows she can catch up with me at anytime cuz I have my cell at all times. I got one when I was 9 cuz I ccompetitivelydance so I would be gone for a full weekend and she liked to check in ever hour(agh) or so to make sure I was still alive. Also all her friends probably do have them. Trust me at 11 having what my friends had as far as what I considered to make them more mature made all the difference to me.|`|rE9J1DqTaa	I got one when i was 10.  Mainly for emergencies.  I say let her get one theirs a lot of creeps out there but if your daughter happens to be in-trouble for or in a mix up she should have a phone.  My neighbors got their daughter a flyer-fly. Its good for kids who r young.   your daughter will have your number the home phone and and her dads phone also she has freedom to have her other friends numbers theirs also a button on the side that she can press to call the police it works great in emergencies     Hope i helped  =D|`|jzdDF3Ljaa	If you can afford it and she's pretty responsible, go ahead.    Everyone is getting them when they're little kiddies these days.|`|C5Tit9HLaa	ya thats fine  got mine wen i was 10
ldN2AL1zaa	first because they love smoking when they first try.  second because they are influenced by the society.  third because to relieve stress|`|MyIobIEaaa	It could be due to stress, they need an outlet, it could be because they aren't supposed to so it is fun and it could be because of peer pressure also, and it could be a combination of all of them.    I never smoked as a teen and still don't to this day so I don't really know for sure but those are my guesses.|`|JVPt99Hxaa	because it makes them feel all grown up|`|838VJJGvaa	Stress or to be cool are why the kids I know do it.|`|ojTcrqAOaa	1 Reason:  Peer pressure&it's "Cool"    Yer, well..wrong.  I hope some of them  get lung cancer.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Because they're weak and want to have a "problem."  Everyone knows what smoking can do, and people start doing it because they want to be able to whine "i need a cigaretttteeee".|`|kGCd8ioRaa	I guess they think it's cool|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? To feel grown up. They think they look older and cool. Realistically, they look so stupid and childish. ??|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Its all part of experimenting|`|UZKg2odzaa	i did it when my friends were doing it. not to be 'cool' or anything like that, i just wanted to try it. but i dropped that crap about as soon as i started it. haha|`|pJeFpC7qaa	I guess to them its 'harmless' but its really not    maybe once is okay, but its not cool. I don't know why they think its cool. To me its disgusting and it makes you stink    Some people just wanna try it, which I guess is ok but whatever.     Also I guess peer pressure, which really sucks. But you can still say no|`|J7HTo1psaa	To make them feel hard, and all there friends do it.|`|rE9J1DqTaa	stress.  peer pressure   or they want to feel ''cool''|`|y3u5WYDMaa	they think its cool  it gives them the bad boy look  peer pressure  parental influence  idkk  idkk    i think its gross im 14|`|1ASc1Is7aa	I use to have this guy friend who smoked. I asked him why and he said that he started at a young age because he thought it was "cool." Just like with all the advertising and everything. He still hasn't gotten himself to stop.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	why do adults start smoking?|`|MrNkNnhyaa	some do it b/c their friends do it  some do it b/c they have alot of stress  some do it b/c peer pressure.  etc.    :]|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Peer Pressure or they think it's okay because their parents do it.|`|RBOc42Koaa	Because they want to see if they would like to do it.|`|kmmlc4m7aa	Its really alot of reasuns whyy..  mostly its bcuhz they see other people do it and they are probably peer presuredd ..truss mee i knoee!!|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	they think it's cool to try it just once and and it only takes one to become addicted.|`|HdHR0Ltraa	Its "Hard"|`|wqRwSaGSaa	helps stress
7cvoxQitaa	If you are sick, it's ok!! No, really!! When you give birth you go to the hospital, there they can give you things to help you, and hopefully by that point if you wouldn't be contagious any more so your child would be ok with you holding him and kissing him!! Ask your doc if there is anything you can safely take, because being in labor is hard enough with out a cold racking your body as well. You will need all the energy you can get!    By the way, Congratulations! I wish you and you family much happiness|`|HoJ1pLtraa	Drink a lot of water and eat a lot of fruits it will probably ease the cold down some|`|JDw1RDcaaa	your cold could be a sign of early labour, i know it sounds stupid but my best friend felt run down and had cough and was all snotty which just came on when she woke up on the friday then on the sunday her waters broke but when she got to the hospital she was told she had been in labour since the friday.    And     The other day someone posted on here that she had the same thing happen to her.    Good Luck|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I got a cold within the last few weeks with ALL of my kids (I have three) surprising enough they went away as soon as I had the baby!!
TGlWnFjxaa	Plan B makes your cycle irregular. Give it a few more days then take a test. Just remember something If you take plan B and less then a month later you took another one, then the chances do get slightly lower. Dont panic. Most likely your not. If you panic the stress can cause your irregular period to extend longer. Hope this helps|`|a732fa3f8cddea280f517bd70486000faa	Usually it takes about maybe 2-3 weeks for you to start having pregnancy symptoms...although you don't have to have symptoms to still be pregnant...you need to go buy a pregnancy test... and wait your bladder is full before you take the test...that way it can be more accurate. Or you can schedule an appointment to see your doctor to find out for sure if you are pregnant or not. Plan B does not always work for most women...So you would do better by taking a home pregnancy test or seeing your doctor...Wish you the best!|`|0Id85yiYaa	i would give it another couple of days, then test.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.      Most likely irregular from plan B pills darling.  Definitely get on bc darling.   Plan B's are pretty strong.    God Bless x you should be okay|`|mYGbxuCAaa	its probably messed up since you even said it, if its late for another week take a test and go to the doctor they will tell you for sure!    best of luck , dont smoke or drink, just in case!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	It does mess up your period. Kudos to you though for being safe and trying to prevent an unwanted pregnancy!! You should talk to some of the other people on here that say I had unprotected sex could I be pregnant?? It's just stupid. I would wait for a couple more days and then take a test.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	I hope you learned from this that you need something besides condoms. I had to learn the hard way too. My daughter is now almost 22. LOL! Good luck!|`|VD4JgFnGaa	most likely ur  cycle mess up  but since i u did take  it the day|`|MOsStEbqaa	No matter what the plan b pill will mess up your period. It can also make it come sooner. All you can do now is wait and see if your period comes in the next couple days. If not take a test it will be the only way to know.
4ME3vNTbaa	Pregnancy tests are almost always correct if it is positive. However, when it is negative, there is a 50/50 chance that it is correct. You can check again in a few more days (preferably 3-5 days after your missed period) or you can go and get a blood test that is 100% accurate and tests for the hormones that are elevated during pregnancy.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    possible that you tested too early. Because your levels arent high enough.  Take the test in the morning. especially any day after that period is missed.    There is still a high chance.    God blessx|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Umm well you might want to add some more details...like when your regular lmp was, also when did u have sex...as in how long has it been. And what symptoms are you feeling?|`|CuCrGDuRaa	How late is your period?  I didn't get a positive test until I tested five days after my missed period, and in the morning.  You may need to wait a few more days and then retest in the morning.|`|aHBh67n6aa	it all depends on when your period is due... if its past your due date then a test should show positive at anytime of the day... however not always, your first morning pee contains the highest level of hormones so you should do another test using your first morning pee. if that comes back negative you should see your doc and see whats going on...
AiUCeifEaa	Pretty crappy. I am 38 weeks and 3 days. I am always sore and haven't got a good nights sleep in a while. I can't wait to hold my baby boy!|`|AOfm8ey6aa	I am not 38, I am "only" 35 and 4 days and I already feel terrible. I count day by day since about 30 weeks. I am so over it, I hate being pregnant but I can't wait to see my little son's cute face for fist time! I am hoping another 2-3 weeks and the baby will be here. My first daughter was 10 days early, so chances are this baby will be early too. Especially, when he feels so big, my belly is bigger than it was when I gave birth at 38,5 weeks.

3K7ffKn2aa	most likely but not defiantly. You never know where your child's genes will come from. You and your child father are the SAME height as me and mine (ooooohhhhhh spooky lol). Our child will probably be tall but i have a lot of aunts and uncles who are barely pushing 5'7 (i got a few that barely hit 5 uncles included). No way to know until we have em    blondes and blue eyes are recessive traits so your child might come out with darker hair and eyes depending. Once again no telling . Good luck and congrats|`|4AO2myzKaa	What I have heard is to average your heights, then add two inches if it's a boy and subtract two if it's a girl.  In other words, if you have a boy he will be about as tall as his dad and if it's a girl about as tall as you.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	i have a friend who is 6 something and both her parents were tall    my mom and dad are both green eyes,dark brown hair and under 5'5 and my sister is blonde,blue eyes and  5'11.    i really just think its random.|`|i3CWq8Plaa	Nah, I'm afraid they'll all be swarfs!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Very good chance of being tall.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	My mom is 5 feet tall and my dad is 5'6" - my brother is 6'4". Oh and both of my parents have brown hair and I'm the only red head out of 4 kids. Recessive genes can come up at any time!|`|AOfm8ey6aa	It is random. My mom is 5'6" and dad is 6'4". I am half inch shorter than my mother and my brother is same hight as our dad. I was very tall as a child, my growth stopped when I was 10 years old. I was told all my childhood by doctors and "experts" that I will be tall as my dad. Now look at me, I am 5'5" 27 y.o. :o) My fiance has a brother and they have same parents. My fiance is half inch shorter than his mom, who is 5' 9" and his brother is about 6 foot 2 inches I guess. Their dad is about same hight as their mom. Its random, you never know what genes your kids inherit :)|`|SKqV374maa	wont it be fun to watch and find out|`|I7myOp8Qaa	If you are both tall then there is a good chance that the baby will also be tall. As for the blond hair and blue eyes thing, I am no genetic expert but from what I was reading recently if both parents have regressive genes ( I hope I used the correct word) and blond hair and blue eyes are the result of regressive genes, then your baby will most likely have blond hair and blue eyes too. But then again, stranger things have been known to happen and you just might end up with a brunette. Who knows?|`|P37lIBr2aa	It really just depends. My dad is 6'2" and my mom is 5"1' and somehow I ended up 5"2'. :-( My dad's height didn't really help me out lol.

But my mums side of the family is really tall, which a great aunt that was 7 feet tall!!! My brother is tall too. So I think it comes down to genes.

AA11871343	There is some good news. PCOS does make it harder to get pregnant, but it is not impossible. It is important to be treating your PCOS the right way even when you are not trying to conceive. This will make it easier for you to get pregnant when you're ready. Here's some basic PCOS info:    I recommend seeing a reproductive endocrinologist They are generally more knowledgeable about PCOS and the correct treatment. Unfortunately, many doctors are not aware of the proper treatment.     The underlying cause of PCOS is insulin resistance (IR). The best treatment for PCOS is going on an insulin sensitizing drug such as metformin (1500-2550mg per day) combined with a low carb diet and exercise. There are a few important things to know:    1. Many women "pass" the test for IR, but still respond positively from the metformin. No one knows exactlly why..my thought is that the test is not a sure fire way of detecting the IR.    2. You must be on a high enough dose of metformin. I've heard women complain that their bodies dont start working even though they've been on metformin for awhile. Some doctors are hesitant to up the dose past 1500mg...but for some of us it takes more. I don't respond until my dose is around 2000mg a day.     3. It can take a few months on the correct dose, before your body is regulated.     4. It is important to treat your PCOS even if you are not trying to get pregnant. There are higher risks for many things (high blood pressure, blood clots, diabetes, and many other things) when you have PCOS, but if it is treated properly, then those risks are lowered.     I also recommend a couple web sites:  http://pcos.itgo.com/  http://www.inciid.org/faq.php?cat=infert...    http://messageboards.ivillage.com/iv-bhp... This one is a great message board where you can ask all your PCOS questions or just chat with the women who are also dealing with PCOS. Good luck.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Well, your gynecologist should be doing things to help you with your fertility. She should have given you more explanations, talked about medications available, and possibilities for changing things regarding your condition.  Some women do get pregant after weight loss and a return to more regular ovulation when their periods are regulated. I think you need more info. from your doctor.|`|832e8cafea63c171fc089cc6874145cdaa	I have PCOS too.  It became really noticeable when I went off  the pill.  Weight gain, breakouts, loss of sex drive--basically hormones went wacky!  I only have my period once or twice a year--and when i do it is extremely heavy.  I have tried to conceive since 2001..no luck, even with medicinal help.  Wish I had a better story to tell you, but for me it has been a bad thing.  Good luck to you.|`|c30989255926b11e4d7190783dacf785aa	Hey i am also a PCOS patient.but u know what i have a son who is 28 months old now.believe it or not it is true that i conceived. i am married for the past 4 years now.  ok now about PCOS - weight gain,irregular to no periods at all, are just few of the things that we have to cope with other than the mental pressure that makes us feel very very bad and low.  i would like to tell you few things that i personally did to ensure tat am back to track -   1) exercise religiously atleast an hour.this will help you to keep your weight under check.  2) eat balanced food - eat samll quantities of food at regular intervals throughout the day (consult a dietitian)  3)meet your doc and have a check and have scanning done to monitor your ovaries and the eggs and their actions.  4)lastly dont get stressed as this will have an immediate effect on our body and will show up.  i think if all this is done it will definately help you conceving. God bless.|`|dd0ed08a0a1c3bdf161565fb4e03a190aa	IVF (in vitro fertilization) treatment; IUI, ICSI and Laparoscopic surgery is very cheap in India. The cost is very low and the medical services are very good in India.    My cousin and her husband got their IVF treatment in India through the Forerunners Healthcare in India and is all praise for this company. She is a known case of PCOS.She is a very happy mother of a baby boy now. She just paid 2500 pounds for the full IVF treatment in India for which she was quoted 8000 pounds in private setup in UK.    Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the newspapers. I have also read about a Chinese couple who planned surrogacy through the Forerunners Healthcare. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery and infertility treatment like IVF, IUI, and ICSI abroad for low price. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery and treatment  can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.    http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com  Hope this helps.
D2l4sND2aa	Im not a fan of either of those names, but here are some I like:   Isabel (if you like the belle thing)  Madaleine  Elizabeth  Genevive    Echo Belle is pretty, but it doesn't seem like a name... kind of like a story book or something    I dunno goodluck|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Onnalie Reigh  Onnalie Kaelyn  I love Belle but not with Echo......Bethany Belle|`|XkWTsyJdaa	idk about echo...sounds interesting. i do like onnalie  blayke anela. anything with a short middle name will sound good.|`|QAN5OxWIaa	onnalie jayde  onnalie grace  onnalie rose|`|boqwvEvUaa	that's cute! ;)   Onalie Isabelle Anela  Onalie Noelle Anela  Onalie Brigitte Anela   Onalie Vivienne Anela  Onalie Rose Anela|`|fDWaM4XCaa	Onnalie Belle?

H2IhRXIIaa	I actually thought it was possible becaus emy mother says she had hers for the first 3 months when she was pregnant with me...but I found some facts u might want to read which should help u better understand what your body "MIGHT" be going through.      Can you be pregnant and still have a period?       To start with, always remember that pregnancy and periods can never go along simultaneously. If you are indeed pregnant, technically, you cannot get your periods. Missing your period is actually the first sign of pregnancy. Bleeding in early pregnancy is a common occurrence, but this does not signal a true menstrual cycle. You must realize that the hormones that are active during pregnancy totally prevent ovulation. As we know, ovulation is the time in your cycle when the egg is released into the uterus and women experience menstrual bleeding. Since the egg in pregnant women is already fertilized, ovulation does not occur and hence no bleeding.    Early Pregnancy Bleeding  However, it is not uncommon to find that many women do report getting what seem like regular periods during early pregnancy. The bleeding that pregnant women complain about though is not truly a menstrual period. It can be called as early pregnancy bleeding. The perception of having a menstrual period (or more than one) in early pregnancy can confuse the due date and delay some pregnant women from seeking appropriate and timely medical care. In instances where a couple is unaware that they are expecting, it can be particularly emotionally challenging to find out about the pregnancy at the same time they are told that the bleeding might signal a problem.    It can be hard to calculate your date of delivery when you arent sure which period was the true last menses. A number of timing issues can help provide a ballpark estimate of when conception took place. Pay attention to these dates for help - when did you have unprotected intercourse, when did the pregnancy test turned positive (especially if there were some negative results before the positive one), and when you first noticed symptoms of pregnancy (such as breast tenderness or nausea). An ultrasound is the best technique to determine the babys due date if you are not sure about one or more of these dates.    Identifying the due date is quite important in prenatal care, since some tests, like the triple check, are standardized by the exact number of weeks of gestation. In addition, most couples as well as their practitioner want to have some idea of when to expect the baby. Here are some explanations for what may seem like regular menstrual flow when you are pregnant.    Implantation bleeding  Many mothers-to-be get a few days of bleeding right around the time that the early embryo is implanting into the wall of the uterus. Generally, this occurs five days after conception and may be confused with an early period. This implantation bleeding is normal and is not a sign of any problem with the pregnancy.    If you have irregular periods or have not kept track of your cycles, you can easily confuse this bleeding with a menstrual period. If it is counted as a menstrual period, this can lead to a mistakenly later due date. In reality the last period from which the due date should be calculated would be the one prior to the implantation bleeding.    Conceiving while using birth control pills  Studies have shown that women who get pregnant while on the Pill might also have intermittent bleeding. There can be a few episodes of this bleeding in these women before they can ascertain that they are pregnant. The calculation of the due date based on the last menstruation will most likely be inaccurate. In such women, it is advisable to go on for ultrasound to date a pregnancy|`|aEZcc9LBaa	yes it is possible mu friend is 8 months pregnant right now with her first and the first two months of her pregnancy she had her normal period.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	No you can't be pregnant and have a period. Your period is your body discharging an unfertilized egg, and if its fertilized it shouldn't discharge. Your probably just giving yourself symptoms take a test to be sure.|`|AA11362517	My friend swears her mother had a period until she was almost 7 months with her.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	You cannot get your period when you are pregnant, but you can have spotting and other kinds of vaginal bleeding during pregnancy that can be mistaken for a light period.  That happened to me during this pregnancy.  When I went for the first ultrasound I turned out to be at 13 weeks rather than 11 weeks as previously believed, because I had bleeding when the egg implanted and thought it was my period.    Take a pregnancy test to be sure one way or the other.      A few months ago, my husband and I were in the same boat as you are and found out I was pregnant.  After the initial shock, we were able to work things out and are expecting a baby next month.  There are options available to you and your husband, and you don't have to make any choices right away if you find you're pregnant.  Give yourself some time to think things over.|`|SXUtlbx8aa	While it can happen, it is generally not typical to have your period while pregnant.  Please see the referenced website I have attached for more information about this.    As to your nausea, breast soreness, tiredness, and heartburn; I would have all these symptoms, occasionally,  during PMS week and AF at times. Other times I would simply have mild back pain, or the occasional cramp. Your body won't always do the exact same thing every month.    It is also possible for you to be sick. IE: a stomach virus, flu, etc, and being on your period is not helping.     Should you continue to feel ill, I would urge you to see a doctor. If you are truly concerned about being pregnant, get an early detection pregnancy test.|`|DEB1RpAMaa	It is possible, I promise.  I have even asked a doctor and she told me that it can happen.  I was pregnant once before and I got my period when I about 9 weeks.  Basically your body thinks you're supposed to have your period so it continues normaly even though you're pregnant.  Of course there's a greater possibility that you're not, so you do need to take a test to be sure.  And remember about HPT's...there's never a false positive, only fase negatives.  So to be 100% sure, you should go to the doctor.  Good luck and I hope you get what you want.|`|kprKXEOSaa	If you're pregnant and have some bleeding, it isn't menstruation, it's bleeding, or a miscarriage.  That might be what you're experiencing, a very early miscarriage.  You may also have happened to get a bit of food poisoning or the flu at the same time.  You can take a pregnancy test just to be sure.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    no its not possible. to have period while pregnant.  Period is extracting all of the uterus lining and nothing is left inside and egg is passed.    But.  Breakthrough bleeding can occur darling.  ITs when a woman bleeds when period was meant to be due.    Confusing but thats what its called darling.    Definitely get a blood test darling. its possible that you are.    God bless x|`|yJCdLNHwaa	It is possible to have even a full period during your pregnancy.  I knew this woman who went her whole pregnancy having her period.  It could be that you are in your third month.  Better make an appointment with an ob/gyn.  If you can find one that has a mid-wife. If he is unable to help then she/he is qualified to assist you.    I also forgot to mention that it happened to me. That is until I found out I was pregnant and slowed down. Over-exherting yourself while pregnant can lead to what seems to be a period and a numerous amount of complications.|`|AA11763588	It's a No and Yes answer.    No, you can't have a period. A period is when your body is releasing an unfertilized egg from your body. If you are pregnant then your body is not making any new eggs. Therefore you can not have your period.    Yes, you can bleed when you are pregnant, sometimes around the time you would have had your period. This is due to your hormones being out of whack and some of the lining of your uterus will shed.
K5TrkUhCaa	No you are not to blame! I'm sure you do feel awful and she has no right to make you feel worse. Pregnant women have a hard time seeing their own feet just to put their socks and shoes on much less see a roller skate that she should have been the one to put away in it's proper place to begin with! Accidents happen and if she wants to blame someone then she should be blaming herself for not picking things up off the floor/stairs so as to avoid any falling accidents. You were trying to help them out, they should not treat you like that. I'm sorry for what happened and how you are being treated, I really hope things get better for you and I'm sure your niece/nephew will pull through and be just fine. God bless you!|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I would say your not to lame one we are clumsy when pregnant and two why did they leave the skate out? Anyone could have fallen over it!|`|0Id85yiYaa	you are in no way to blame. accidents happen, and i think your brother and his wife need to show a little more respect and appreciation.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	it's not ur fault, if it's anyone's fault, it's ur sister in law who's leaving crap laying around knowing that u're pregnant. sometimes pregnant women can't even see their own feet bc of the belly in the way. don't feel bad, even women who carry their own child tend to fall down once in a while, it's k. and the baby will be fine too, if u didn't bleed, then there was no damage done.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	first of all accidents happen, second of all maybe if she cleaned up her crap the accident wouldn't have happened so if someone is to blame it's the one who left SKATES ON THE STAIRS (I mean not a smart move) and third of all they should be thankful that A. you were watching the kid they have and B. you are carrying another kid for them and they should be thanking you not blaming you for anything. don't let them get to you like that and you should tell your sister in law that if she can't be more supportive (considering losing the baby would be harder on you then her) then they should shove off. you didn't do anything wrong|`|QSodlfMraa	no, things like these do happen. wish you the best.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	I'm not sure I can help you because your basic problem seems to be that of fabrication.   In the past few weeks you have asked a number of questions - some 3 or 4 times  anywhere from 1/2 to 24 hours apart.    Now let me see - you have been a surrogate mother with sister and mother who won't speak to you.  Now you  are surrogate who had accident which caused baby to be born prematurely.  Some time before all that, you had 17 y o daughter who was pregnant and 13 yo daughter who "slept around".  What a tragic life.    Is it possible you are a teenager who has a vivid imagination?    Actually, up to a point your stories are quite believable.  Have you considered studying creative writing.  Soap operas always need new material.|`|zoEvwmXCaa	She needs to be thankful that you are even doing this for them.  I'd have it for myself.  How selfish can she be really??|`|UYfqzCoMaa	She should have kept her house cleaner and made it a safe environment for you and her daughter to be in. What would she have done if her daughter would have fallen down the stairs because she tripped over the roller skate???|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Tell her she's being a ***** blaming you for this, especially since your using your body to carry and deliver her baby. It's her fault she left the skates out. Don't feel guilty. You couldn't help it. Hang in there.|`|b10aMPdOaa	This is not your fault.  You were looking after your niece.  If they were that concerned they should have made the skates were not lying around in the first place, they should have put them away.  Please don't blame yourself.|`|ULgGWDnWaa	that is cheek, you are nice enough to have their baby! but when you fall on a skate she left their she's giving out! she should not of left it there in the first place!|`|3qI1oyFaaa	Things happen, you are in no way responsible. You're doing a great thing for them by sacrificing your body to enable them to have children, how dare she blame you for an accident. If it wasn't for your caring and selflessness, she wouldn't even have a baby to be worried about.     Keep your chin up, it's not your fault :)|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	Maybe I misunderstood - but you are carrying your brother's baby?  That sounds a little unusual..    Well anyhow... they are blaming you cause they are scared and handling their fears badly and unfairly.|`|n6OemdySaa	it is not your fault at all. They should have had things put up. Accidents happen! Everything will be ok.|`|HoJ1pLtraa	Well then maybe someone should do the cleaning more ofter because it is not your fault at all people do fall gravity doesn't stop you from falling it onli helps you bust  your butt|`|wObmwK1uaa	This is not your fault at all and don't let them tell you that, they should be grateful you are doing such a wonderful thing for them. You don't need your sister in law making you feel guilty when you already do, try not to feel guilty though as accidents happen.    x|`|JDw1RDcaaa	Your doing them the favour of a life time, so just ignore them, accidents happen nobody can change them. Ive got a memory of a gold fish at the minute as well and it is her fault if anyone is to blame because things shouldnt be left out like that.    Hope everything is OK  Good Luck|`|OeKgopilaa	its not ur fault.|`|AA12089900	It's an absolute disgrace that they would even think to give you grief, you are doing one of the most hardest & selfless things any woman can do.    Well done you for doing such an amazing thing they should be taking care of you making sure you are comfortable not blaming you for ANYTHING    Take care xxx|`|LZ4QYrPXaa	no you are not blame at all! what you are doing for your brother and his wife is very kind thing and they should be more concerned about your welfare than blaming you! they should be appreciating the sacrifices you have made for them and not expecting you to look after both there children both born and unborn in your condition! they should be hiring a baby sitter and taking better care of you! and as for the skates its a proven fact you have problems with your memory when your pregnant! and besides why should you have to spot every potential hazard your supposed to be in a child safe home due to their daughter anyway, not an assault course! take care of yourself and don't listen to the over emotional voices of your brother and sister-in-law. and don't get upset its not your fault.
soFpywFcaa	sound like your preganat good luck get a test asap|`|K2jT1z5jaa	if you have had sex could be implantation bleeding.  or period coming if maybe iregular from stress of diet change.  Take a test if it doesnt come normally in the next week.    god bless x
AA11763588	Yep, most women will think they are getting their period, just for it to never come.    Wait till you miss your period before you go and take a test because you could get a false negative.|`|Bbn1ZSTcaa	you would not be experiencing any signs of pregnancy just yet so it probably your period coming. Take a home pregnancy test (hpt) just to be sure.|`|T48smu01aa	Yes it will fell like your going to start and then you never do....take a test if you should have started then you should get an accurate result by now if you are!  Good luck sweetie!|`|HPRlEWu1aa	yea .. thats the very 1stsymptom i got|`|gyoylefvaa	yes, You can having any form of period cramping. But is 50% yes you will have and 50% you will not.|`|85V6cHe4aa	Possibly yes,some women get these period type cramps as a symptom but its hard to know the difference early on.    If its been two weeks since you had sex a test should show a pretty reliable result now,use first morning pee to increase accuracy.|`|BRBPDBvIaa	yeah you do experience cramping during pregnancy.  I did right before I found out I was pregnant.|`|52U22fiAaa	yes.  i had PMS-like symptoms.|`|soFpywFcaa	yes cramping is a definite sign wait to see if you miss your period and take a test ..good luck|`|7cvoxQitaa	You could be cramping if you were pregnant. If you are due for your period soon... like within the next 5 days, many pregnancy tests can detect pregnancy 5 days before a missed period, so you may want to try that.
K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    i recommend you go and see a doctor darling. They will be the best care for you.    drink lots of fluids.  Back : from baby bump   Stomach : Uterus stretching more possibly.   its good she is active. But definitely see a doctor.    god bless|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	It's a good thing that your babies kicking a lot. it's normal to be feeling this way. get to use to it honey it's only gonna get worse.
5vtVsqx6aa	I love that you are trying to tie the names together. However, I definitely think that people would misprounouce and/or make fun of a girl with the name Elsiauna. Many would not know how to begin to pronounce it (even though it makes sense to you!)    How about using Elsie as a middle name?  Or changing it up?  Elise is the same letter and just as cute.    You can also find some variations of Korin.  Coralyn or Corina are beautiful.     If you really want to keep the name you have, I might spell it Elisanna or Elsianna (no "u")    Good luck!|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Elsie Anna|`|fDWaM4XCaa	Elsiauna? Weird. I'd just name her Elsie.|`|MtoIxY6Qaa	janie is an adorable name!!!!|`|pLcUFBl2aa	I wold spell it like Elsyanna.|`|boqwvEvUaa	What about Ellysana? if you switch the i sound with the s, it flows better :) or Elisanna, Elysanna...|`|2ucsbBGjaa	I think its too complicated. People would get very confused|`|b4IK780Raa	Bad, bad, bad names. Do not name your kids that!|`|dKMpztcJaa	I like Elliesana Corryn    (Ell-ise Ah-nuh Core-in)    Super cute name|`|7YYXmDemaa	I personally dont really love the names  yew should use my name (:  Jazmah (jazz-muh)  Elizabeth... my middle name (:  i honestly think there gorgeous names  and im sixteen.  and im not african amercan either im white.|`|6BdI1xnPaa	I don't like that spelling way cuter the proper way Elsie Anna
H2IhRXIIaa	Well since you dont know when your missed period will be wait about 3 weeks...Because a normal period comes every 28 days..and usually a pregnancy test can tell a week before your period..but you dont know when yours will be, so it might actually be best if you go to a local clinic and take a blood test. They usually all do it for free. But still needs to be about 3 weeks.      Best of luck!|`|d1csiCLKaa	first response tests can be use as early as 4 days after a missed period.    Good Luck!!|`|0Id85yiYaa	5 days after your missed period
6avKnzkoaa	The doctor could have missed the heartbeat or you're earlier than you think. The first ultrasound I had was at 8 weeks and I could see a heartbeat inside a white "blob" ~ Don't give up hope yet. I wish you the best ~|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	I am sorry! I would keep hope. Doctors are not right all the time, they are only human. Good Luck!|`|pVWk12oOaa	Go to another Dr for a second opinion, that doesn't sound right to me..  I feel like 6 weeks is pretty early for the Dr to be looking for the heartbeat, but I'm not sure.    Best of luck!!!!|`|IrZoanZ8aa	Dont give up of course! Stay strong. Good luck. Ill keep you and baby in my thoughts. ( :|`|Wps4XuqHaa	To tell you there was 85% chance you had miscarried was wrong!! She had no reason to do that. I had a scan with my 2nd daughter at just over 6 weeks and there was no visible heartbeat. I had another scan 2 weeks later and a heartbeat was visible then. Do not be worrying yet, just wait till your next ultrasound.|`|26A1Q3eqaa	i wouldnt stress over it if you are not bleeding you are fine dont worry my dr seen a heartbest at 6weeks2days and again today at 8 weeks i had a m/c in october but i bleed then went to the dr and was about 5 weeks and they seen a baby forming but never finished :(   most people dont hear/see the heartbeat at 6 weeks if your not bleeding than you are fine!|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	I went in when I was almost 6 weeks and on the abdominal ultrasound they didn't see anything at all!  On the trans vaginal ultrasound all they could see was a sac.  My doctor suspected a blighted ovum.  I went back at about 8 weeks and they saw the baby and heartbeat and everything was fine (although he was measuring a bit behind that time).  I am now 35 weeks pregnant with a healthy little boy!  I would go back to the doctor next week.  I prepared for the worst but I hoped for the best!  Good luck!|`|XCueIYnYaa	It is uncommon to hear the heartbeat that early. Just don't stress, it can put your body under more stress and lead to miscarriage.  Keep your head up and go to the dr.  Best of Luck!

Di questo argomento ne avevamo parlato io e mia figlia pi volte, io le ho sempre detto che la scelta ,se tenere o meno un figlio,  sempre sua, anche se io propendo di pi per il tenerlo. Anche se  dovesse allevarlo senza un padre accanto, io le sarei vicina, le ho detto che in casa c' sempre posto per un bambino, inoltre l'aiuterei a continuare gli studi fino al raggiungimento della piena autonomia, in modo di garantire egregiamente un futuro per suo figlio. Io la penso cos, spero che anche la mamma della tua ragazza la pensi cos.

AA11985760	Wait until you are 16 weeks to be safe. I had dental work done while pregnant, and everything was fine. The biggest concern is the x-rays, which they have the lead vests for.    If 6 months ago, you had no cavities, and now you do, I don't think the filling will be very deep. Probably just a surface filling, but ask your dentist to clarify for you.|`|AA11109728	I went to the dentist while I was pregnant.  I got a routine cleaning, but they couldn't do x-rays.

Some countries have banned pregnant women from having mercury fillings for this reason.  If you look after your teeth well, a cavity shouldn't progress at such a fast rate.

Use arts and crafts and singing- all children love to sing and be productive.  Use bigger crayons for the 2 year old.  Never use small beads or buttons with the 2 year old when making crafts.  Puzzles with big peices for the two year old.  have reading time.  Also lots of outside time when its nice out and some even in the winter- make sure dressed warmly.

Light a bon fire. Tell ghost stories. Might wanna hold back on the grog since its a public place and a cop or two might swing by your way.

bc5jGZ0uaa	It's called FMLA, but there are certain requirements:  1. you have to be employed at the company for at least 1 year  2. the company has more than 50 (I think) employees within a certain mile radius  and   3. the illness will last at least 3 days - they may or may not require the doctor to fill out paperwork stating this.      Of course this is all un paid leave, but you can take up to 12 weeks a year without being discharged.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	you can take your vacation day to take care of your sick children, or i believe there is a family leave if it is going to be prolong leave, check with HR.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	read your HR manual or ask your supervisor.|`|10mOwk0Taa	The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows for up to 3 weeks if you're needed to care for: your child, you spouse, your spouse's mother or father, your own parents.

BhQSTvLsaa	This is what I think (if you are being serious)    First of all, I'm sorry you got into such a confusing situation.    Love can do a lot of crazy things to you. You never know what's really gonna happen next when you fall in love with someone.    I know how you feel.    I've never gotten pregnant, yet I don't even think I want to....EVER. The thought of having a living thing inside MY body freaks me out just a little bit. And the pain you go through giving birth.... And taking care of the child.... I'm really self-centered. It'd be hard for me even to have just ONE kid.    Anyways, back to you. Here's what I think you should do: Talk to a psychologist or a socail worker. Get support from someone. Maybe a realitive or a friend. Maybe even get a mentor through school or something. How are you going to get the money to raise a child? I don't know for sure. If your boyfriend's aunt is really amazing like you say she is, then maybe she can help you out. Heck, she already bought you an apartment! You and your boyfriend need to put together a game plan. Be prepared for anything.    Good luck to you. I know a lot of adults (and teens) think it's crazy that teens have kids so young. But the truth is, it doesn't matter how old you are as long as you're REALLY in love and you've got the smarts and maturity. (I'm not saying an eleven year old should have a kid, but you get the picture.) It may not be the best situation. But hey, you and your boyfriend stood by each other since you were seven. I'm sure you'll get the help and support you need. Just don't let anyone bring you down. Confidence is a very important key in a situation like this.|`|dVFTWemjaa	just calm down n take a deep breath   if u wanna email me my email is hardcore8989@yahoo.com|`|C5i0kmtJaa	Well chances are your teeth are going to rot out because you are so young the baby might suck the calcium out of them.

You want your child to have the best .|`|M7Ozqujtaa	LOL "dating at 7" Wow.... Well you should have thought of that before you had sex! I' m 16, and pregnant but i knew what i was getting myself into!! You need to get a job... have your boyfriend get a job and raise this baby. Good luck|`|4547eab5ec2a01595d1f92cd2bc3c40aaa	FIRST MAKE SURE YOU GO TO A DOCTOR REGULARLY AND TAKE CARE OF YOU AND THE BABY- YOU CAN TAKE PARENTING CLASSES, AND START SAVING UP- DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOUR CHILD AND YOU.|`|cMrxyWQ0aa	Together at7???????? WOW.  All I could say is your fault for having sex. :]|`|cLgghhuXaa	Get a job and start making and saving as much money as you can cause kids cost!    There is no manual out there that tells you how to raise a kid. Most people just copy their parents technique (they may change it a little though... the things they don't like.)...    YOU NEED TO FOCUS in survival mode. What do I need to do for me and my baby to be ok? Do you plan on staying in school? (I would! You'll be thankful down the road.)    If ever you are homeless... you can call this number... 1 800 999 9999. It's an organization called Covenant House... they help all sorts of teens in all sorts of difficult situations.    ***Remember there are now 2 people depending on you!And whatever you do effects the 2 of you...|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	Take a parenting class at school or go to the hospital and and take one.|`|jPlUycx0aa	Maybe it would be best if you allowed a good family to adopt your baby.  You have to do whats best for your child.  You should watch the secret life of the american teenager. or you can try to juggle school and work at the same time.  One of the parents have to get a job and support the child if you decide to keep him/her. Im glad you have decided to keep him/her. abortion shouldn't be an option!!!!  Talk to a foundation for teenage parents or something.|`|AGaT3BDMaa	Ur mom kicked you out :( aww I am sorry. One of my bffs got prego she gave it up for adoption. It was a really good choice cuz she knows it will get a much better life then shuffling around with a teenager who is so not over the live for the moment stage er w.e. Ya but if you are really wanting to keep it think about how much ur life is going to be put on hold. but a couple of my friends and I(we are really close with the girl who got prego) went to a parenting course at the childrens hospitale when she wanted to keep the kid. It was free and we foudn out alot of stuff... (after that i will nvr have unprotected sex lol)    Good luck I really hope it all works out with ur mom...|`|r39EDGhPaa	You're seriously goin to let her pay for you to get an apartment?  Wow, that shows just how irresponsible you are.  Any decent person would turn that offer down, or offer to go halfsies at least. Stop mooching.    Well, you're pregnant, so you'll have to figure it out soon.|`|LMRaSXFeaa	you need to get a job to support your baby.  then you should go to parenting classes.  you should be fine.  all my best.  :]|`|wzXJOSIeaa	You started dating at 7? This must be a crock!|`|y3u5WYDMaa	there are parenting courses u can take|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	If you don't know how to take care of a child then its unfair for the child if you keep him/her. Give the baby up for adoption so that he/she can get a good start in life, he/she won't get far in life with two parents who are early to mid teens and who have no idea how to care for him/her.    Also what about the financial side of things. Getting a job is difficult for anyone right now with the credit crunch and recession but especially difficult when you are still a child yourself as you won't have any skills necessary for work. You might think welfare is the easiest way to go but let me tell you that claiming welfare for the next 18 years won't teach your child anything.    I would do the right thing by your baby and if that means giving the baby up for adoption so that they get a decent life then so be it.|`|lOuiQm4Saa	go read some prenatal books. there's this book called "What to Expect When You're Expecting" which is good. your mom is so mean. i don't want to sound rude to ur mom, but she should've had some sympathy and took care of you instead of giving the boot. your BF is a great one at that. God bless you.    *don't have caffeine~ so far one of the only facts i know |`|0xiHNsmVaa	What a stupid thing to do.
kcmRROk0aa	You don't know how expensive it is to adopt or to get into the US?    If you are thinking of getting into the US via a relative visa based on the fact that this person will adopt you, I don't think you will succeed.    Are you at all related to this person by blood? You *might* have a shot that way.    I can tell you how much it was 5 years ago when I got my (British) husband into the US -- it was around 3K (Pounds -- not dollars)!!! (We used a lawyer just to make sure everything was done correctly.) Not cheap!!!    The person who would sponsor you (assuming that this adoption scheme of yours would work) would also have to show that he has assets 3?5? times the poverty level for the size of his family. Five years ago, when I sponsored my husband, I had to have around $100K in assets for our family of three! (myself, my husband, our child) Federal poverty guidelines tend to change so it could be more now.    The process takes a while. You could be looking at 2 years from start to finish just to get all your paperwork taken care of.|`|gCVA7Z1Maa	I don't think it's that difficult for a citizen of the UK to obtain a work permit for the US provided she has some marketable skill and fills out the required paperwork and pays the proper fees.     I also don't think there's any legal way nor legitimate reason for one adult to adopt another; imagine how your real family or his would feel? And even if you could that has nothing to do with being able to come to the US. It won't make you a US citizen and it's not a path to permanent residency.    Permanent residency is reserved for fiances and fiancees of US citizens and possibly their children from a previous marriage. Skilled workers can also petition to come to the US provided they have a job waiting for them.|`|zLoyo24Taa	I dont think its possible, but I dont know the laws on UK adoptions.|`|CLcGxHpAaa	I hope you're not serious...  Adoption is the act of placing a CHILD in the care of an adult parent(s).You are not a minor, therefore you cannot be legally adopted.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	umm, you`re not a minor. You can do a name change.|`|e0urnErUaa	u cant|`|UGY3i7BWaa	YOU ******* DIRTY WOP LISTEN UP  YOU ARE AN ADULT NOT A CHILD .GET A LIFE AND STOP BEING A BUM.
eg9wjUQ7aa	Don't feel bad cause all these ladies are bashin on ya. Lots of kids get in trouble with their parents, and alot get in trouble for weed. I know it's happened to me before. Just lay low for another year and then you'll be 18. She will still try to tell you what to do, but once your 18 you can make your own decisions. Just remember, she is your mom! It's not like you can just stop talking to her, and all she probably really cares about is your safety. Almost all mother's constantly worry about their child's safety, it's a very annoying trait when you are getting to the age when your about to be on your own. Just remember that she loves ya! Good Luck!|`|2jMFurDoaa	i think shes being totally fair, my parents would probably chain me in the basement if i got caught with drugs especially by the cops.     your 17 and you still think the world is against you. shes just wants you to be safe and she is probably hurt you do drugs. id say shes probably pissed off too.    just oblige by her rules. what is it really hurting? your mom is regaining trust in you and maybe you'll get your head straight and figure out whats good and not good for you. do you really want to get in more trouble by her having to file a runaway report?|`|SRsFkNBBaa	no. we just cant stand your decions or attitude. we wish you would listen to us for gods sake, and quit trying to think you know absolutely everything.  its ok to experiment, but to have it enough to be caught by the cops, and to ruin your life by having that on your personal record-i would be pissed off at you too.  she is actually being more lenient that i would be. if you were my child and caught with pot, i wouldn't let you leave the house except for school. you wouldn't have the keys to your car. you wouldn't have the keys to my car. and i would drop you every week, randomly, to make sure you aren't "experimenting" anymore. and i would tell you to like it, or get over it, so you should try your damndest to make the best of the situation.  i actually, got caught with pot when i was 17 also. it wasn't by the cops. it was by my parents. my dad took the 8th and flushed it down the toliet right in front of me. actually, had me push the flusher. so not only did i just flush $70 down the toliet, i had to explain to my friends where their little investment went. i lost them as my friends becuase they thought i was keeping it for myself. and i lost my parents trust-which really sucked becuase i had at least another year to live there. :0)  you will realize when you are older how many stupid things you did. it's called learning. good luck, sweetie, and be thankful your mom cares enough to discipline you at all.|`|YxMh2aAOaa	your mom hates you because you smoke and your an ungratful brat|`|mppKv11Eaa	No. It's the choices you made. She doesn't trust you anymore, and you have to gain that trust back. It may take years, but keep off the weed, and prove to her that is was a mistake that you regret (you really, truly have to mean it. Just saying you do doesn't fly unless your mom is the gullible type). She's just a worried mom and doesn't want to see your life go to hell. Just do what she says, and deal with it. And don't say to me, "oh, MJ is good for this and that" b/c, I already know. I wrote my 11th grade research paper on how it SHOULD be legal (because the reason for it being illegal, in America, anyway, is based upon old prejudices and misconceived facts...but I won't go into all that ^^; ). But, alas, in your country (I'm not going to assume you're an American or what have you) it is not legal to be in the possession of any of the members of the Cannabis family. And it seems your mother has a strong belief of this. So just be a good son to your mother, who, whether you want to believe it or not, is really doing all this for your better interests.     Also, if it was your "friends" that got you into doing the drug in the first place....I'd pick friends who wouldn't endanger your well-being and hope of a good future.|`|85gJHDbNaa	Just for the record, just because he does drugs does not mean he's irresponsible. The only immaturity I see here is the fact that you think she automatically hates you for your age. She's pissed because you went behind her back and did illegal she did not condone. She's just frusturated because her OWN SON got caught with illegal substances, and is very very disappointed in you. Stop being immature about it and deal with your punishment.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	If she hated you she would not care what you did. Your lucky your not in any legal trouble this time. But remember your name will come up if your stopped again and it won't be nice for you.  You need to grow up and bit now OK ?   You are 17  not a baby.  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|RarSAK4Haa	its not just you mom that hates you. everyone does.|`|veO1RXrCaa	Well Mister if she hated you she would let you do what you want.  Bc she loves you she is being "hard" on you.  I would do a lot worse if you were mine.|`|nXxtBkguaa	dude, you were caught smoking weed, do you really expect that to blow over in two weeks?|`|yCR6qg0baa	You're an idiot. You're using drugs & trying to pass the blame on her????? Riiiiiight.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	it sounds more like she loves and cares about you. why would you do that to her?|`|Gr78AFvyaa	you are obviously irresponsible and immature, its not her, its you! and its going to take longer than 2 weeks for her to trust you after getting busted by the police.|`|0dqfwKk7aa	This doesn't mean she hates you.  She cares about you and wants you to stay out of trouble.  To you  it feels like hate, but one day you'll understand.  Try to earn her trust back, it might be hard but maybe then she'll treat you more like an adult.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Sounds to me more like she loves you. If she hated you she would have kicked you out. Not only did you almost get yourself in legal trouble but you could have gotten your mother in legal trouble. If your getting high and destroy someones property or injure them who do you think is going to pay the bill? If you bring drugs into the house and the police find them who do you think is going to jail? The answer is NOT you.
26A1Q3eqaa	yes it is normal im 8 weeks and im misserable im sick when i wake up and sick when i go to sleep try drinking ginger ale when i do it helps you can also ask your dr fro some med's i i got my morning sickness pills today so im not sure how well they work but im sure they work better than nothing|`|dPgP28Aiaa	Yes it's normal.|`|fdalc5Rcaa	yes very normal im 21 wks and still being sick ...|`|7SKVCPcSaa	oh gosh yes.. its all part of being pregnant. the lovely morning sickness stage. should clear up around week 15|`|1o820L3Daa	Yeah its normal, before I knew I was pregnant (i found out at 5 weeks) I felt so sick. The smell of eggs turned my stomach and so did the smell of coffee. Yeah its normal.

I'm pregnant with number 2, and it seems my gag reflex is through the roof (didn't have that problem with  1). I have a hard time swallowing pills, and the slightest things make me dry heave--even just taking out the trash!|`|82ORY9UFaa	Yes it is, the best thing to do is to eat little snacks, it helped me a lot with the morning sickness, nausea. And drink A LOOOOT of water.
aHBh67n6aa	yes because you ovulate before you get your period... the egg is released and travels down the falliopian tubes and into the uterus, if the egg has been fertilised by the sperm it will attach to the wall of the uterus (resulting in no period) but if it hasnt been fertilised then it will float in the uterus for a few days before your body gets rid of it and the lining of the uterus (a period) so it can start the process all over again.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes.  You actually ovulate before you have a period so it is possible.|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	If they haven't started yet then know. If u r not actually on ur period at the time then yes.|`|qN5iVvAFaa	What do you mean with out their periods??? like they haven't started yet, or they are between periods??|`|3nDGDgC2aa	yes you could be about to start.|`|fdalc5Rcaa	yes you can aslong as you have had periods in the past...........

YFPMcHCbaa	No one here will be able to tell you if you are pregnant. Almost all of the symptoms you get during pregnancy can be associated with something else.|`|cheXY6NEaa	Good luck|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Same symptoms as PMS too. You'll just have to wait and see.  Everyone is different.|`|bNjjC8jMaa	Seems likely to be the case|`|CG5L6Fm6aa	could be prego had same time my doc told me i was pregnant yesterday|`|AA12128230	It might be that you are pregnant. Remember thought that not all periods are the same and sometimes we don't experience the same things. try not to think about it because the more you think you are pregnant the more you'll get the syntoms. Just wait to see what the doctor has to say about it.|`|wJADv2dUaa	i agree no one can tell you if you are or not,but good luck....and please let us know the results
hfqUp1IBaa	less than 3%.  All the brown blood means is old blood.  I have gotten it before after I had sex.  Chances are that she is not pregnant but there is never a 100% unless you use abstenence.|`|Ciizvi3daa	I wouldn't be too worried. Sometimes stress can play tricks on your body. You should probably have her take a hpt and then in a week or so you should have her take another if her period still hasn't come. But many times throughout a girls life she is late. A lot of things can affect it.|`|gyoylefvaa	97% She will  be not pregnant.  3% She'll be pregnant.|`|iFAlZfVMaa	take a test....|`|CuCrGDuRaa	The chance that she is pregnant is very low.  Most likely it's the stress that is making her period a little late.  However, if it still hasn't started by the end of the weekend, it won't hurt for her to take a pregnancy test.|`|56TFDm3Uaa	Very low chances of pregnancy.   Just be sure to take a pregnancy test if she doesn't have her period soon.  You both seem pretty sensible.|`|Lb4tAQQmaa	well..  if you used a condom there shouldint really be a chance..  but she is a few days late and sometime sa browiish pinkish period like thing can sometimes be signs of pregnancy|`|WsUSAgLmaa	She probably will get her period. Sometimes your body plays tricks on you when you start stressing over things. I doubt she is pregnant.|`|IU0LQQw8aa	take a test
UYfqzCoMaa	My husband brought me pink roses(we had a girl) and a thing full of bubble baths and bath salts which he knows I absolutely love!!! And some really soft slippers and silky night gowns. By the way congrats on the new one on the way and you are awesome for being such a nice husband and wanting to show your wife that the you appreciate what she has gone through these last nine months to bring you the greatest gift in the world, a new baby!!!|`|qN5iVvAFaa	I would have to say a ring, or bracelet with the babys birthstone in it... that way she can remember that day, in more than one way. and the baby can't pull on it and break in, like they could a necklace or earings|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	My hubby bought me a full-day of pampering at local spa. I got a massage, facial, pedicure, and a mud wrap. It was heaven! And definitely made up for the last few months of hell, lol.  :)|`|sOYUCM1vaa	A good mother/baby book never goes amiss. I know it might sound hippy-ish but books like calm mother/calm baby, baby massage etc are good. that's only if she enjoys reading. I loved getting a big 'ol fruit basket with gourmet stuff in it also. The fruits healthy for her too. Here's the big thing though hubby..... when you actually get home, your helping look after her while she's looking after baby for e.g. 'would you like cup of tea?', 'do you need me to get anything for you?' will be your biggest and most appreciated gift to her.. believe me. When I'm cranky with my hubby, if I can just remember how well he looked after us afterward, when we got home from hospital, I stop my cranky mood. (You have to do this for more than just a day or two and actually want to help us, we can tell if you don't :) ) Even if you work and don't have much time when you get home, just a gesture of an offer is the best gift..after the gift basket ;)|`|I7myOp8Qaa	If you can afford it, a piece of jewellery might do the trick. I've always thought that a chain with a special pendant or perhaps a bracelet would be great because then the mother would have the memory forever. On the other hand, you know your wife best, Does she like jewellery? You can always give her IOU's or coupons promising her time off so she can go to the salon or just hang out with friends.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Maybe a nice piece of jewelery - necklace, earrings etc  Something that she can cherish forever, and remember the arrival of your child|`|CpiLHcTlaa	well balloons of course! and when i gave birth it was a day before mothers day and my mom bought be a white gold locket that said mom on the front. maybe some kind of necklace or bracelet? maybe even a family ring? or if your looking for something more practical... maybe a foot soaker? that she could use while feeding the baby?|`|XflZjhaXaa	First of all, your great for thiking ahead about something like this. Good job! Okay now to your question... anything she can use right away to make herself feel better would be good, so maybe some comfy slippers, a nice smelling lotion or body spray. Or you could get creative and give her coupons for diaper changes or nights that you'll get up with baby while she sleeps.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	That's very sweet. Pick something that she would really enjoy, not a cookie-cutter gift. If she loves a good haircut, give her a gift certificate for a salon. Or a gift card to her favorite clothing store to update her wardrobe. Believe me, she's probably tired of maternity clothes by now|`|bZWbwyn4aa	My hubby brought me some flowers and took me out to dinner a couple of days later - I hadn't been able to eat properly for months because of heartburn, and to go out and have a lovely meal in peace without kids was just wonderful!!  I just left my daughter in the nursery while we went out.|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	You could get her a nice nightgown, scented bubble bath, or a mothers ring with your kids birthstones.
JnLoHaoAaa	Sounds like she's pregnant. A false positive is not as common as a false negative|`|e0xpYnv1aa	It's extreamly rare to get a false positive, so if it's positive you can count on her being pregnant.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	There is a very good chance that she is pregnant.|`|4U93EoUtaa	Looks like you're going to be a Daddy.  My doctors never did their own tests, once I said I'd come out positive on an at home one, they just took my word and said OK, you're pregnant.|`|0VHolTVEaa	Positive means positive so she is defintly pregnant. Congrats|`|4fIE3Eb2aa	Yeah, She's more than likely pregnant! Congrats.
WGAFP6mSaa	 don' ?now..    allowng ?d? o vew e world n a wole new way?    lol...?orry.  ave no cle.
wDisAke1aa	nope, bro. you're fine|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	She can be!|`|H2IhRXIIaa	She needs to either take a pregnancy test or go to a local clnic and have them give her a blood test.|`|CG5L6Fm6aa	could be stress but a small lil hole in a condom sperm can get though and get a girl pregnant
26A1Q3eqaa	yea you should be fine as long as you stop now that you think you might be prego! and congrats|`|0Id85yiYaa	yes. this is very normal. stressing about it will actually do more harm than the alcohol|`|I7myOp8Qaa	You should be ok. I didnt know I was pregnant when I consumed champagne at a celebration and then wine when we went out to dinner. Hold off on the alcohol until you are certain.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Your bub should be fine - a lot of women experience this before they find out they are pregnant (including me) Just don't drink now that you think you could be. Perhaps let the Dr know if you are pregnant|`|O4JuH8zmaa	Oh don't worry your baby will be fine! I found out I was pregnant last year the day after my husband and I had gone out and gotten pretty drunk for Valentine's day!|`|H2IhRXIIaa	U should be a ok. Esp since u think, meaning if you are then u r very early. I was at clubs, partying, and smoking when I found out I might be preg. I stopped right away, as soon as the thought came, and sure enough I was preg. But because I stopped and got on prenatal pills for the baby, im now 21 weeks preg with a healthy baby.|`|byQDwPv8aa	Hello, you should be fine as long as you stop now.    Hope it all goes well :)      x|`|GAMypxIFaa	You are fine!! As long as you stopped when you had the feeling, just make sure and if you are then at least you stopped, I know woman who drank there whole pregnancy and the baby was fine, a little small and fussy but fine, you shouldn't worry though and if you are pregnant the doc will ask you questions about drinking and drugs and they will tell you if you should worry or not! Most woman don't find out until later on anyways, And had there little weekend fun and it didn't effect them.
0VHolTVEaa	Spicy foods and going for walks help. Good luck|`|98WKYtfwaa	Squatting, walking, drinking lots of water, eating hot spicy foods and sex. These might not work for you, but good luck.|`|wjPoMK9Iaa	well i have heard spicy food, which is an obvious one.  and i know this sounds odd, but if youve ever watched Michael Macintyre you would know :  Semen and pineapple. they both contain some hormone that should speed things up.  i know which one i would choose!  haha  && congratulations :) best wishes   xx|`|TJHfkN6gaa	a warm bath work as my mum says ( not to hot tho)    its my nephews 6 birthday today :)|`|AA11362517	Sex, Sperm softens the cervix and makes it ready also nipple stimulation releases a hormone that speeds up labor.|`|1uyhFsFsaa	a hot bath works wonders to help you start dilating quicker. i had a slow labour with one of my kids and the midwife ran me a bath and told me it would help things along, within about 20 mins i was contracting nicely and dilating properly with quite a bit of speed.     you can try this but don't be too disappointed if it doesn't work as everybody is different after all nature will take it's course eventually.    if this is your first baby it will take longer as first babies are usually reluctant to arrive for some strange reason     good luck|`|I7myOp8Qaa	Nipple stimulation works, I hear.|`|7ec1aa38a5171789cb76c4135993d94caa	A hot curry or a brisk walk will help things along.    Good luck!|`|a86IJoFjaa	Walking and sex are what did it for me. With my daughter I was in early labor for 5 days, then one morning I went for an hour long walk, had sex, and she was born that night, one week early.|`|AA12128230	The best way to help you go into labor is by placing a towel in worm Water and placing it in between your vagina. that will help you out tremendously good luck.|`|RR2FKrsnaa	They say dancing energetically, drinking coke, taking cod live oil but you know what? Be patient. It'll be so worth the wait and once you've had the baby all madness breaks loose.    Make the most of the peace (even if painful) Baby will come when it's ready.      Congrats and good luck?|`|JDw1RDcaaa	a nice spicy curry and a long walk then a nice hot bath just so you are relaxed in case you go into full labour.
IAqNJQtnaa	Yes that is a perfect size for a 14 year old. Usually girls our age (i am 14 too) normal weights range from 115- 135lbs. ur good :) i am more developed and i am 129lbs
MIUzgwsTaa	Very normal    Im around your age    im 5'6 and about 120 and I don't look over weight or under weight|`|dVFTWemjaa	yes u are perfectly fine dont worry|`|rE9J1DqTaa	totally normal  dont let anyone tell you other wise|`|mFC2RBL3aa	Yes I don't see what's wrong with that.|`|QNZM0ONdaa	I think that you should gain maybe like 2 to 3 more pounds because i am 14 and i am 5-2 and i weigh 100 and the doctor said that i should be around 105 pounds|`|szE6NtO5aa	That sounds like a very healthy weight for someone your age and height.  I looked up your BMI and it is 19.5 which is on the low end of normal. I don't necessarily put much stock in the BMI, but in this case I think it is pretty accurate.|`|oU1yUxwwaa	yeah...nothing is wrong with you. everybodys body is different.|`|KwJDWvB3aa	you are actually really light....you should be around 130 to be at a healthy weight.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	you sound fine, but i don't know what 117 lbs is? Can you convert this to stone please?|`|aSuLnvoSaa	yeah totally.        stop worrying about it youre perfectly normal/average in the healthy range
X14EmlrXaa	I like Andy  better then Andrew, but it goes nice with Jacob.   Luke is my boyfriends name! I like it. I love the name Aaron!It is so cute.   Elisabeth is so cute and Madeline is super cute. I love both names. I might just steal that, i am having a baby. Anyway, I LOVE THAT NAME SO CUTE!   Olivia is like the coolest name ever! Alexandra is okay, it goes good with Olivia!   James is an older name but it is so cute and makes me think of a super sweet man/child. Matthew is cute and goes good with it.  Wow, Kateryna, never though of that name really before, but it is BEAUTIFUL! Noelle, wow! you pick really good names to go together! u really do!    LOVE PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE NAMES    HOPE THIS HELPED|`|Org2hdfUaa	Andrew Jacob = I LOVE the name Andrew, especially with the middle name James so Jacob is pretty close!  Luke Aaron = Aaron Luke flows piles better!  Elizabeth Madeline = Madeline is cute but Elizabeth is outdated. Eloise is a cute alternative!  Olivia Alexandra = GOREGOUS!  James Matthew = Another favourite of mine but a little safe!  Kateryna Noelle = I prefer the spelling Catriona or Catherina but it is cute though a little ''old''    =)    X|`|v2ut95Wzaa	I like Andrew Jacob and Elizabeth Madeline the best but they are all really nice names...|`|RP2ygRaNaa	Andrew Jacob  Olivia Alexandra  those are the ones i lyk :)|`|mcNt6Kapaa	Kateryna Noelle. Prettiest name Ive haerd in a long time & I work with babies.  The boys names r just adequate. Andrew will become Andy & James will become Jimmy... Yuck! How about Lucas instead of Luke? Good Luck!|`|4ME3vNTbaa	OK...I really hate to change a name around but what about Madeline Elizabeth? It sounds royal to me.      And KUDOS for Kateryna Noelle. Its very beautiful    Ok now the boys....  I feel like the combinations don't match up too well. But since I don't want to be in the business of changing names to much I will vote for Andrew Jacob because it sounds more like a future business man or doctor. Luke is too uninhibited and James...too common.|`|89nAvgvOaa	Olivia is beautiful   but she will never use 2 long names.  The key to use 2 names is to keep them rhyming and at least one of them short. E.g: Lis Natalie.     Luke has been overused in the recente year, Every boy from work colleagues in the past two years had luke in their names    Elizabeth is always a winner|`|D2l4sND2aa	I love Elizabeth Madeline and Olivia Alexandra,   I like the name Luke, but it doesn't go with Aaron- maybe Luke Matthew?  James Matthew is okay, but I like the reverse M. J.    I don't llike Kateryna Noelle. Maybe Katherine, but...  don't like Andrew|`|aknvXYijaa	Luke Aaron  Olivia Alexandra|`|iwVzI8wSaa	Andrew Jacob  Elizabeth Madeline  Olivia Alexandra    My name is Nieve and my middle name is Elizabeth.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	andrew and olivia|`|fDWaM4XCaa	I really like all those names!    My favorite is Kateryna Noelle. I prefer the spelling Catarina or something more similar to that, but however you want to spell it.    I also like James Matthew. It's a nice simple name.|`|boqwvEvUaa	Kateryna Noelle is my favorite--I love the name Noelle, and it sounds cute with Kateryna ;)   I don't like the boys as much. they're not bad, just not great either :)|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	I like your names|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I love Luke Aaron and Olivia Alexandra.    But my favourite would be:    Luke Jacob  Olivia Madeline|`|HjiqMDI6aa	Luke Aaron and Olivia Alexandra are beautiful!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	andrew jacob is awesome!    and i think olivia noelle would be pretty :)|`|5vtVsqx6aa	I like all of them except Elizabeth Madeline and Olivia Alexandra.  I like the names themselves, but the 6 syllables is a little long. A shorter middle name would flow better.    For example: Kateryna Noelle flows better because the middle name is shorter.    But they're all very nice! Good luck|`|dKMpztcJaa	I like andrew james(not jacob) and Katerina Noelle|`|3MmVWDT3aa	I like Olivia Alexandra- but I would try the middle name as Autumn. It is a pretty name Olivia Autumn. My all-time favorite names are Madelynn, and Abella- but Mason for a boy.|`|7X1xO1yjaa	Kateryna Noelle is a nice name.  I wouldnt name any of them but still theyr nice.|`|CsFVuq87aa	Why all these double barrelled names? Just concentrate on a first name that's the most important to begin with. I love Olivia, my fav girls name, good choice.
JnLoHaoAaa	If I were young and pregnant, what would I do with the baby's father?    I would try to make our relationship work, I suppose?|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    I  would Stay strong as much as i could during pregnancy and every day & start my new life with baby.    god blessx|`|UYfqzCoMaa	what is WH? But if I was young and pregnant I would realize that I couldn't take care of my baby by myself and give it to a family that would love it the way that it deserves. Then I would realize that I made a mistake by having sex so I wouldn't do it again for a long time and focus on my studies and get my education. You already know that you can have children so do so but in the future when you can actually take care of it properly.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	maybe we could answer your question if we knew what WH stood for...    2 points.|`|qN5iVvAFaa	it really depends on how old you are, how old he is, and your parents....|`|HPRlEWu1aa	wh ? ? ?  pls explain|`|c8231f1c2871ecc3f6adf7b7e74dde8baa	...???|`|wPtX51cjaa	well hopefully he would be there to help you out if thats what your asking|`|zoEvwmXCaa	depends on the relationship already in existence.  if you're too young to be having the baby then give it to someone that can raise it in a good home with all the things it needs and wants.  the "baby daddy" part makes me think you're too young to be even having sex.  he needs to step up and be a father and a big role in the child's life.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	not sure what you are asking.|`|HoJ1pLtraa	I would figure out what my circumstances are make sure that i am stable enough to support my baby just in case he decides to leave and try to be a family if he decides to stay babies grow better with both parents around and if you decide not to keep it There's always adoption I would never recommend abortions so I wish you the best luck|`|v1IzWlqQaa	Make him step up to his Responsibilities.
tapFZBowaa	Perhaps teething and wanting Mommy?  My 5 month old takes his naps on me all the time.  Exhausting but I know soon he won't need me for that, so I try to enjoy it!|`|ubf26k2Oaa	Whatever little sleep routine you use at night, try to use it for daytime naps too.  I make his room dark (not pitch black, but subdued) give my son his dummy, place his blankie next to his face and put on his lullabies. If he protests, I go back and check him but dont pick him up. The lullabies play for approx 15mins and I have read that the mobiles, etc that last for only a few mins dont help..it needs to be 10mins or longer.    Make sure he's not overtired when you put him down..look for the sleep cues..rubbing his nose, eyes or tugging his ear or yawning.    If he really wont sleep in his cot, then how about putting him in the pushchair, reclined and going for a walk? That way you have a little break yourself too.  Hope this helps :)|`|DIZKlxNraa	"No-cry nap solution" book suppose to be helpful. I have the same problem.
Y4MAdfP4aa	it does trust me. i am 33 years old today and time flys so fast.  CANT PRESSS STOP. my oldest kid in alreadly in 7th grade kids sure grow up fast the youngest one is in 2nd grade he was born in 911.  time flys before you know you will graduarte high school. it goes by so fast|`|wnkoTEqVaa	look at it this way    http://www.the2012londonolympics.com/for...|`|FvhCUHjxaa	No hun; I graduated in 2008 and it went by SOOOOOOOOOOOO fast. Yesterday my old school bus drove by (from 2nd-8th grade) and I was like, I'd do ANYTHING to go back on that bus instead of going to college. I'm a freshman in college and 2012 seems like forever but it's already gone by really fast; even though I love school and never want it to end. Enjoy every moment of everyday because when it's gone it's gone and there's no going back.|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	High school went by faster than junior high for me.  I just graduated last year, I remember first thinking that 3 years is a really long time, but it really isn't!  I kind of miss being in high school sometimes now :( so enjoy it while it's there!|`|Qydtjz2naa	I'm also graduating in 2012.  I think it's weird that we're already more than 1/8 done with high school!

It goes by so quick its kinda sad.|`|brlkDf08aa	I'm a senior this year, it seems so slow when its happening, but when I look back it went by ridiculously fast.   I some times wish it would slow down! i'm not ready for adult responsibilities yet, so defiantly be grateful for how long it seems to be taking.   In reality, its only 4 years of your life, and then its gone :[|`|3MmVWDT3aa	At least yours isn't in 2014- I want to grow up!|`|b5eSmOhiaa	Well I'm in 7th grade, so I have 2014...That's alot longer then you, ha.

MOsStEbqaa	Why not just go with it. Its also her b-day and she seems like the party type so let her handle everything. You might even have fun doing something with friends. If you don't its just one year that you didn't and don't do right on your b-day so it doesn't feel like its really your b-day.|`|1ASc1Is7aa	Well if she is so excited why not just go on and do it. You never know, you might have fun!    If you really feel that strongly about it then I guess you could just talk to her about it. Or maybe just have a normal party with friends without the whole cake and present ordeal.|`|bFJQyRusaa	If not for yourself, throw a party for HER, pretend it's her b-day. Everybody loves a good double-B-day party. And NOBODY likes a party spoiler.
A89ezcg5aa	Sprinkle White vinegar in the tub followed by  baking soda.  It works like Scrubbing Bubbles minus the chemicals.  It does stink, but it wears off fast.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	use hot water and bicarb to scrub using a brush then pour white vinegar over it.  the bicarb will take all the scum away and make it all white again, and the vinegar will disinfect it.|`|yCR6qg0baa	Anything you can buy in a store will be fine as long as you rinse it off really well. Vinegar & lemon juice smell awful & don't kill bacteria or fungi. Comet or Ajax are cheap & work well. Just rinse them all the way off. I mean... you wash clothes & bottles in chemicals. Does your baby get sick from those? It's fine.    Mr. Clean magic erasers are AMAZING and very cheap (only like $1.60 for 2).|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	LOL, the three things I was going to recommend already got recommended!     I use vinegar to clean everything, then follow up with a little bit of lavender, mint or lemon oil to kill the smell. I usually use lavender and lemon in the bathroom though, it makes it smell so clean and fresh.     Also vinegar and baking soda work great in the toilet. And for cleaning your drain and metal fixtures. It's also a fun science experiment. You can also kill two birds with one stone and wash your fridge shelves when you scrub the tub. Add about three cups of vinegar to about 5 inches of hot bath water and let it sit for a little while. Then add some baking soda and scrub away! Hubby always make fun of me because I usually do it topless... I always end up soaking wet though. lol, I guess it is pretty funny...    And I love magic erasers. They work great on everything. Just don't let kids play with them. They can irritate their skin.|`|FHT6wsUpaa	White vinegar...it disinfects and cleans nonporous surfaces as well as any household cleaner. Other benefits are that it's easy on the environment and won't fade, scratch or otherwise harm your tub like a harsh chemical cleaner could. Good luck!|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	baking soda is a great and natural cleanser. Scrubs the scum away. Also another mommy mentioned this the other day...the Mr. Clean Erasers...I tried it...and WOW they work GREAT!! Squeeky clean and bright.      ** when I read that about the erasers, I was like, I have to try that..I already knew they would work on many other things, but getting the tub that bright and no fumes...oh I was in heaven...took a bit more arm work, but its worth it.|`|W8UZebRWaa	I use Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. It's all natural and has a very nice Lavender scent. It's very good.  I figure though as long as you rinse off very well whatever you use, it would be the same  *Magic Erasers in the tub do work wonders!
5DJzp6bMaa	I was a Father at 15 and the Maternal Instinct kicks In , Im sure she will be a great Parent and it sounds Like you will Be there to Support her and thats Great, Just take things one day at a Time.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	To start she should tell the babies father you  might be surprised and get help from him. She might after birth of the baby change her mind and want o be a bigger part in raising the child but to be safe be prepared to raise another baby|`|TZN0v8r4aa	You probably will end up taking care of the baby but make it clear if you're going to take care of the baby then it's your rule.  A lot of girls have babies and want their parents to take care of them but by their own rules.  If she doesn't want to raise the baby then she doesn't get to make the decisions for the baby.    You should also think about getting custody of the child that can be reversed if and when she's ready.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	make her deal with the consequences or you will be raising a lot more kids.     The baby sleeps in her room... if she doesn't like babies than she should have abstained from sex    You love your daughter and you will love this grandchild... but you can not love by enableing.. i know its hard but stand up for once!!|`|QSodlfMraa	you def need to let her take same responsibility for her action, but you can help her and she need to let the father know too so he can do his part.|`|pKr77Vqiaa	Wow how did she just find out, how didnt you no your little girl was pregnant, I dont think she should be having sex If she wants you to do EVERYTHING for the baby, what are you going to do If she has the baby and you raise it then she gets preg again are you going to raise 10 kids on your own, goodluck I feel bad for you.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	YOU NEED TO SET THE GROUND RULES NOW!!!!!  How dare she ask you to care for the "mistake" that she made.  She need to take responsibility for that child and realize her life of drinking, partying and socializing with friends are over before they even started.  She either looks after the child or gives it up for adoption.  How irresponsible.  I really cant believe that you are considering bending to her request.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	it sounds like you are about to be a mom again. she may or may not mature enough to care for her own child, but therapy is definitely in order.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	ur daughter sound incredibly imature .. no offence .. but maybe u guys should give the baby up for adoption and bless a couple that has been trying hard to get pregant with a baby. maybe u should put ur daughter on birth control or tell her to keep her legs closed if she doesnt like kids and doesnt want to raise them. thats so selfish of her to ask u to raise it till shes ready to take care of it one day ..  and if u deceide to keep it, she needs to take care of the baby .. u can be there to play with it and help out .. but she should grow up and be a mother if she thinks shes old enough to be having unprotected sex   oh and the father? he has the right to know! who are u and ur daughter to keep this from him? he has every right to know!!!|`|ITu6gONdaa	Honestly, i dont think that you should have to put your whole life on hold so you can raise her child. Your going to end up raising another child. She expects you to do everything for her and she can just play with it and pay attention to it when she feels like it. This isnt fair,she got pregnant,not you. At 15 she shouldnt be having sex and if she is then she should be mature enough to use protection and deal with the consequences when she doesnt.|`|z1YM1Xniaa	You should really have a sit down with your daughter and talk with some mediator there, like a psychologist,  physician, guidance counselor, pastor, priest. That can see both sides of your stories thru and thru. Then give you their oipinion if you want an outsiders point. Why does she want to keep the baby if she does not want to do anything with it but play with it? You may as well adopt it. Because by the time she grown up enough and ready to care for the baby, the kid will be bonded with you and not her. If she tries to take the baby away from it's familiar home, the kid will have trust issues and will probably have hard feeling toward each of you. Your daughter made the choice to have sex, if she wants to keep the baby, she needs to grow and not expect you to take care of everything for her. She may be your child and I know you want to be there for her but it is not fair to the baby that you will allow to her be completely selfish in the situation.|`|7cvoxQitaa	Wow, I forgot how selfish and childish teens are. I was like that myself, strange! Anyway. I was reading some of the other posts and someone mentioned that she is being immature, I want to know who they know that is 15 and perfectly mature and responsible?!?   While I think that she is being unrealistic in her expectations that you are going to be the primary caregiver, things can change. Mothers instincts kick in at different times, she may wake up one day and realize that she is carrying a miracle and decides to do the right thing.  I do not think that it is fair though, that you should raise the child til she feels like being a mother. If you raise it and bond with it, it not fair to the child either that they lose their "mother" when the person that gave birth to them years later decides to act like it. So, looks like it's hello mommy again, and the new baby has an older sister!|`|ykP7I3caaa	Ok that answer is rediculous.. Tell her she gets the baby because she spread her legs? Yes she should deal with the responsibility, but if she wont she wont. I think you're doing the right thing by stepping up and taking responsibility for the child even though you didn't choose for your daughter to get pregnant. Being a parent you have to take part of the responsibility no matter what happens, she is your baby. I think the only problem is she sounds like she's not understanding the gravity of her actions.. She should have tried harder not to get pregnant in the first place, but now the problem exists and she should realize [and care] how much strain she is putting on you. She says she doesn't like kids and she doesn't like crying, but has she not thought one second about you? I think she might change her ways after she gives birth to the baby [my mom found kids insufferable before she had her own] but you can't depend on that. If this is what she really wants, she needs to sign full gaurdianship over to you. She can get it back in the future, but I don't really think it's right that she can just dump the responsibilities on you and just take it back whenever she feels like it. Plus, a baby is not something you can rip back and forth as a toy. She needs to think about what's best for her baby and not herself. In your case I do think what's best for the baby is to be raised by you, but down the road.. She still needs to think of the wellbeing of her child, not just jerk it around like it has no emotions at all whatsoever.    EDIT- I really do think adoption would be a good option also. She sounds like she has no interest in it, and you shouldn't HAVE to raise it. It's hard to let it go but think about what's best for the baby.    EDIT- If you are going to raise it FOR her, you should have her sign over gaurdianship when it's born. This way, to get it back into her custody, she must take parenting classes and get a job. Department of Human Services will look into it and they won't let her have it back until she fulfills that. If she doesn't agree you tell her it must stay in her room and she has to take care of it. If she tries and gets tired of it, she'll know she just can't do it and be happier with the decision to sign it over to you.|`|N9HMovQ9aa	no offense to you but your daughter is being a complete *****!! She doesn't like crying she doesn't like kids well that is just too bad and it is her fauld for not having safe sex in the first place if she wanted to have unprotected sex she should have wanted the responsibility of being a mother, she has no right to force that onto you. And if she hurts the child that is just plain scary and wrong and I have great respect for you wanting to care for the child. And it is kind of scary to be a grandma at thirty two.She needs to tell the father what is she thinking I mean it's not like she can hide the child!   One question for you (out of plain curiosity)  A. How many children do you have? Just wondering how much stress will be onto you...  God Bless and good luck  -ME|`|y4E8EoZ2aa	You know what, this story really doesn't sound all that true but if it is....GROW UP AND BE THE MOM! Your daughter is pregnant and she needs to take responsability. Just because she told you what "she" wants doesn't mean she gets what she wants. Tell her she spread her legs, she gets to deal with the baby. You will be there to give support and help at times but all in all this is her baby and her problem.|`|rctDnhO1aa	she might change, i mean doesn't having a child change everyone?  I think that you shouldn't let her dump all the responsibilities on you though it is not your child after all, it is hers.  she shouldn't get to do all the fun stuff with the baby while your doing all the work, if she plans on keeping the baby i say put some rules down, tell her that she has to have a certain amount of responsibility over her child and that you are not going to raise it for her.|`|VD4JgFnGaa	just give her time maybe she will change also grandparents always end up raising grand kids up like there own my mom does that with my son she acts like its hers|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Unless you are ready to start over with another child and you are 100% committed to being this baby's mother, I would tell your daughter to grow up.  Not to be rude but this is her responsibility and you are not doing her any favors by letting her treat this like she has no responsibility for it.  Maybe you could take her to a session for information with and adoption agency.  There are alot of couples out there that would be fantastic parents that are not able to have children of their own, My Husband and Me being one of them.    If you take all the responsibility for the child for her what is going to teach her not to get pregnant again?      Also the guy should know that he has a child on the way, either tell him to sign away his rights, or pay child support and be a part of the child's life.  It is not her decision to make for him.|`|O0eQpO2naa	Well Just to let you know i had a baby at 15 and i was so scared and i didn't want my son sleeping in my room but i got used to it and its Just a stage i think and she'll get over it. You can help raise it but i wouldn't do it for her i mean she is the one who got pregnant. The baby's father needs to know because he might be able to help support it and plus that's not something you wanna hide. I mean a baby is god child you want it out in the open, you don't wanna hide it. Sorry if i didn't help but i hope this will hope.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Contact your local family services agencies for help.    Your daughter needs to take responsibility and not just leave the baby with you.  You sound as if you are not looking forward to looking after a baby, and no one would blame you.  You can help but should not be the primary caregiver.      As for her not wanting the baby's father to know, too bad for her.  Some places require notifying the father.     On a more positive note, most teen Moms I've met have done well.  Please note, however, that they didn't walk all over the grandparents, so do not in any circumstances let your daughter get away with anything irresponsible.  If she goes out with friends and dumps baby on you, call the social worker right away.|`|aHBh67n6aa	ok firstly- the father of the baby has a legal right to know that she is carrying his child. if he finds out that this info was hidden from him then it could go to court and get really messy and could possibly result in the baby being taken of both you and your daughter. so he needs to know. maybe tell your daughter that you will be there with her when she tells him cos maybe if he is supportive it may make your daughter want to care for the baby too.    also your daughter would need to have a major role in the childs life otherwise the baby will grow a strong bond to you and feel like your the mother and this could be off-putting to your daughter and may prevent e strong bond developing between her and the baby. maybe it would be a good idea to attend parenting classes with her (for her sake, not yours, im sure your well experienced) and be her support person at birthing class.   i think that once the baby comes into this world your daughter will look at the tiny little miracle and love it with every bit of her soul, she may just need you to keep her on the right track. i think that your decision is selfless and extremely kind and i think that it would be better for the baby to grow up with family rather then being adopted out to strangers. good luck for the future and let us all know how it goes. xx|`|wxbGmxbOaa	If she is planning on keeping this baby and then just throwing the baby on you, then she is very immature and she needs to seriously consider adoption. There are plenty of couples out there that would be willing to give your daughter's baby a wonderful, loving home. I understand you being willing to care for your grandchild. But if you all aren't considering adoption, then I suggest making your daughter take care of her responsibilities. By taking care of HER child, you are only sending her the wrong message. Your sending her the message that she can make HUGE choices without considering the outcome of the choices she makes. You're only hurting her by doing this. She was apparently mature and old enough to have sex, so she needs to woman up and take care of her responsibility. Oh, and by the way I was 18 when I found out I was pregnant, I'm now 19 and just about 6 1/2 months pregnant with my daughter and my mother would of kicked my a** and made me take responsibility for my child, if I was anything like your daughter. Which thank God I am not 15 and immature and I never tried to push anything onto my mother.     And if your afraid she's going to hurt the baby then why not enroll her in a class that helps young mothers to be. Or you could supervise her for a while and make sure she knows what she is doing. Good Luck.|`|bLngMkFUaa	My Grandmother was in a similar position with my father, she got pregnant with him too early and wanted her parents to look after him. She acted like his mother even though she said she never would, the maternal instinct will kick in. I also have a friend who had a child at 15, she hated children and was letting her parents raise it but as soon as she saw her son she fell in love and cared for it like any other mother. Don't worry.
AA11763588	Call your DR to confirm.    I know when I had dental appointments my Dentist would fax my DR anything he wanted me to take and would wait for her to say YES or NO before he would give it to me.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It's probably safe, but what you really need to do is make a dentist appointment. X-rays and fillings are safe to get in pregnancy - don't suffer needlessly, and it's very important to take care of your teeth while pregnant. If it turns out the tooth needs pulled, however, it'll have to wait until after you deliver. But if it gets bad, it could be an infection or abscess, and you *really* don't want that when you're pregnant.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Go to the dentist.  The pain can be relieved immediately.  Why bother pumping yourself full of drugs when a simple 30 min appointment will fix the problem??  It is perfectly safe to have work done on your teeth while you are pregnant.  Just let them know when making the appointment.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Call your OB. They can answer questions like that over the phone. Usually his nurse can answer that question so you don't have to wait for the doc to call you back.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	yes, but get the kind for babies. it works the same but just not as strong as the one for adults...therefor alot more safe during pregnancy in my opinion. but before you listen to me or anyone else on here abt it  call your doc just to make sure.|`|GDobAMQ8aa	Orajel is not swallowed.  It's a topical anesthetic; there's no harm done to the baby if you use this as directed.  You also don't have to use the baby orajel.|`|gyoylefvaa	NOOOOOOOO.    Take care your baby.   your baby  health is 1St.|`|HoJ1pLtraa	I would suggest you speak with your doctor first because it is a med so ask your doctor if it's ok first ok?|`|UwIpnN2Iaa	I'd ask the doctor about Orajel.. There is baby Orajel, maybe you can use that? Tylenol works pretty well for toothaches too, my OBGYN said I could take that. Check with yours!|`|O0eQpO2naa	I wouldn't bercaus it's in your blood stream and it's possible it could effect the baby.|`|AA11535009	There is no supporting research confirming or rejecting the use of oral pain killers, such as Oragel.It is not known if Benzocaine Liquid can cause harm to the fetus. If you become pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the benefits and risks of using Benzocaine Liquid while you are pregnant. It is not known if Benzocaine Liquid is found in breast milk. If you are or will be breast-feeding while you use Benzocaine Liquid, check with your doctor. Discuss any possible risks to your baby.
Pf9fyEyQaa	I wear Crocs instead of shoes because they are wider and very comfortable on my feet.  They also have a similar version called Dawgs.  Oh and they have a cheap version at most places like Wal-Mart, but it was well worth the $40 investment as that is all I can wear.  I even have a fuzzy lining for winter!    http://www.crocs.com/  http://www.dawgsclogs.com/ (not the boots, the ones that look like clogs)|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I had to buy mens shoes that were 2 sizes bigger than what I normally wore. They tend to be wider in width than womens shoes. Good luck and try not to wear shoes unless you absolutely have to.|`|BRBPDBvIaa	stay away from salty things.  that'll do it for sure.|`|HoJ1pLtraa	Try salt it might work with warm water|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	Have you tried cutting down your salt intake?

VS8mactUaa	What you should have done was got plan b it can be taken up to 3 days after sex to ensure pregnancy, thought id tell you, incase it happens again. You can by a home pregnancy test for like 20 dollars and do it yourself, you dont need parental consent. If you are indeed pregnant tell your parents, you will need help understanding your options, Dont stress yet, it isnt as easy to get pregnant as everyone makes it out to be. Tho It can happen to you. Remember this for the future. IT CAN HAPPEN. So please if this turns out to be a false alarm, consider another form of birth control like the pill with a condom. Its too late for a pill to prevent a pregnancy, know this for the future. Good Luck To you, and remember to think before you act. :)|`|zSABr7praa	The "Plan b" pill is effective if it's within 72 hours.  I would be more worried about STDS than pregnancy.  There's a 20% chance of getting pregnant every month.  Birth control will help prevent pregnancy, condoms will help prevent STDS.  Abstinence will prevent both.  Best of luck.|`|224cm8qtaa	first thing... you aren't texting. Use complete words and use spell check. Secondly, yes can go to the website below for information. However, that is really only for 72 hours afterward. Good luck.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	nope too late .. time to deal with the consequences .. maybe u should get on bc .. u cant trust the guy|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	Well, you're outside the 72 hr window for Plan B, so about the only thing you can do is wait until you miss your period and then get an HPT. If you're going to make grown-up decisions, you have to realize you may have to live with the grown-up consequences.|`|AA11535009	An abortion pill. This is for pregnancies up to nine weeks old and involves taking two drugs  called mifepristone and prostaglandin  48 hours apart. These have the effect of causing the womb to contract and shed its lining so that the embryo is lost through the vagina. This can be painful and some women feel sick or have vomiting and diarrhoea with these drugs.|`|yi5dFO7paa	you should have asked earlier cuz you could have taken plan b. but it might be too late cuz i think it only works up to 4 after the unprotected sex|`|LjKafFL7aa	Take a test.  If you are.   Take birth control.  That should do it.|`|HoJ1pLtraa	you can go to planned parenthood and get the morning after pill it will terminate any pregnancy that is working it's way up|`|tDuMsa1daa	you can get the morning after pill from most chemists, you have to pay for them but not quite sure how much, not sure how long after sex you can take them tho
8PA7ndf8aa	1st No one should judge you on what you are feeding your baby. You should not feel guilty. We moms do the best we can with what we have.     I am surprise she is not sleeping through the night if she is not napping during the day. She is up from 6 am - 10 pm? I would talk to a Doc. This does not sound normal.  My first two woke up every two hours at night until they were 9 months. My third slept 6 hours during the night then still took naps during the day.     Babies are so different. This maybe what she may needs. I wouldn't be trying to get her sleep through the night. Two - four hour are a great thing at two months.|`|Q9qno7EVaa	I think this sounds pretty normal. My daughter is 2 months aswell, she still wakes for night time feeds, usually twice during the night but she sleeps from 7pmish til around 5-6am. Since my little one was born she hasn't been a good day time sleeper, she mostly takes quick catnaps some days she'll have a big sleep 1-2 hours but most days she doesn't, sometimes I think she's tired and try to get her to sleep but if she doesn't I try not to stress too much. I know my little one sleeps really well when we go out shopping. My advice if your daughter won't sleep you might as well go out and do things get out of the house so your not indoors all day with her. But I haven't found anything that works to make her sleep when she doesn't want to. Congrats on your little one and good luck.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	at 2mths old she still needs a feed during the night because her stomach is just over the size of an egg. As she grows she will go for longer without feeds.   Expect her to start sleeping through the night around 3-4mths most likely.  she will nap during the day when she needs to, e.g. during growth spurts, illness, funny weather etc. otherwise don't worry about it, and just enjoy her company during the day :)|`|EJubUoifaa	she must not be tired....(you might want to go see a doctor)|`|ubf26k2Oaa	All babies are very different and you cant really compare with other peoples babies. She will definitely still need a night feed at the moment.  Look for the sleep cues (rubbing nose/eyes, tugging ears, yawning) and make sure she's not overtired when you put her down to sleep.  Follow your nightime sleep routine ( lullabies, etc) for daytime naps too.  If you need a break, then maybe put her in her pram and go out for a walk..you never know she might nod off.|`|S8a0wC9iaa	Babies take a long time to establish a nightime routine. Don't worry about it you sound like you are doing great! If you are bottle feeding let other people do the night feed to give yourself a break. The Contented Little Baby Book gives ideas for routines - but honestly your baby will probably settle down in a few weeks. For info my two both had a short nap in the morning and afternoon and dropped to a single one hour nap straight after lunch at about 9 mths. I used controlled crying with both of mine where I would put them in the cot and visit them at increasingly longer intervals (5mins then 10mins then 15mins etc) until they stopped crying and went to sleep. I only had to do this for a couple of days and they soon realised that when they were in the cot it was nap time! This worked well for mine and other friends babies. As for sleeping through the night it's just a question of time - all of a sudden when you think you can't take it any more they suddenly do!!!
oXzHvsBpaa	No. The abortion pill is a series of pills. They give you one pill which you take by mouth and then the next day you start the next series of pills which are inserted into the vagina. So no she lied.|`|26A1Q3eqaa	hm if it is then man where was i? i have an abortion well it was 3 yearrs ago they did give me a pill but that was to put me to sleep then take the baby out ive never heard of this before but i wont rule it out completly because i have not followed abortion...|`|LKIhUMCgaa	yes, it's an Abortion Pill which can be taken within the first 8 weeks of the pregnancy. it's form of a medication abortion method, the reason why not that many people do this is bc by the time they decide to do an abortion, they're past 8 weeks and cannot take them anymore. here is a link bout the Abortion Pill.    http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-...    EDIT: she might have forgotten to tell that there is another medication that follows the first pill, but the one she might have taken is the actual abortion pill which will make her bleed, after that 3 days later she has to take 1 more pill.|`|soFpywFcaa	no0 never hurd of it if it was that easy abortion would be alot cheaper|`|pKr77Vqiaa	she Is flat face lieing to you, there Is nothing that a doc would give to do that. trust me          She is lieing|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	that's a complete and utter lie. RU-486 works in this way.    the first dose is given at the clinic. this dose supresses the hormones that sustain the pregnancy.     the second dose can be taken at home, either orally or vaginally. this dose causes the uterus to contract and the body to expell the pregnancy.     it doesn't work if you only take one or the other dose.|`|Dm7mPujmaa	No its not she was lying.|`|HoJ1pLtraa	Yeah it's called an abortion pill|`|qHAgbuHkaa	I don't know how many tablets it takes to start an abortion, but I'm assuming it is possible for her to start bleeding that quickly. It wasn't her period though..it was her body expelling your baby. Why did you want her to do that? I will never understand how someone can know their little baby boy or girl is being aborted and not even care. Its no better than killing a born baby.|`|tDuMsa1daa	as far as i know the abortion pill requires 2 pills for it to work effectively|`|ItS4VZrEaa	Someone i know had one, they went to a hospital.  The inserted 4 tablets up her vagina, put her to sleep. Whilst she was asleep a few other things went on, a blob of blood came out which was 'the baby', the placed it in a plastic bag and threw it away.    Also they inserted the rod in her arm that lasts 3years.    You can get the morning after pill, which you take within 72hours of having sex to prevent pregnancy. I recently learnt about contraception/abortions/pregancy etc again in Biology for revision, and my Porf. never mentioned a pill like that.    Look it up .x.
AA11763588	There wouldn't be anything coming out of your breast right now if you were pregnant. The milk doesn't come in until a day or two after the baby is born.|`|ILYEAa9laa	PREGNANCY TEST!|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	yes you can|`|orOqxsulaa	you can but I doubt it I would see your doctor your milk doesn't come in until you've had baby it could be a sign that there is something else wrong.  See your gp asap|`|frItAvRhaa	Um if I knew if you have had sex recently it would put me in a better position to guess!  Yes you can still get pregnant while taking the pill correctly -I should know.  If you have not yet missed a period you would only be at most a few weeks gone therefore you would unlikely to notice a physical change in your abdomen area it's too early.  I would be concerned about what would be leaking from your breasts...you should get that checked out and take a pregnancy test in a few days if you don't get your period.|`|wpjeOLaBaa	The pill is not 100% affective, so it is possible, even tho the pain are symtoms of a period, the substance could be a sign of pregnancy, do a test to be sure!|`|QJDbG1F1aa	You could always be pregnant even though you are on the pill. It's not abnormal for a clear substance to come from your breast either. However if it continues and is runny, you might have an infection.|`|HoJ1pLtraa	Are you sure you didn't slip up on the pill? I don't think any substance should be coming out of your breast but the way it sounds if the substance is white you need to get checked because it just might be so that your pregnant|`|JDw1RDcaaa	i became pregnant while i was taking the pill and i also still had my period for three month so if u think something is different and isn't right then get checked out.|`|f9J0UvYIaa	Theres always a possibility that you could be pregnant, best thing is if you do a pregnancy test, even if your period arrives, its still possible you can be pregnant even with a period. The fluid can just be a general lactation, it happens to some women, if you were pregnant you wouldnt leak from your breast till a good few months into the pregnancy..  hope it works out for you ever way xx
AA11763588	Implantation bleeding does not happen to every woman. And for the ones who have had it they will tell you that it last a day and it is very light, normally the only time they see it is when they wipe.    You either need to take another test, see your DR or go to Planned Parenthood.    Stop stressing, stress can delay a period.|`|4Vchxp32aa	You had sex with your boyfriend?  Why exactly aren't you married?  You should be married before you have sex mainly for this very reason.  Do you hope your not pregnant?  Having a baby is not a negative consequence of having sex, it's on of the reasons to have sex.|`|oOIrXIt0aa	chris if having sex WAS bad it would of been iilegal and getting married at a young age is iilegal there for have sex is free XD!!    BACK 2  THE QuesTiioN:: i think your not pregnant is probably your stressing and your  period is going out of control same thing happen to me!!
cBMwHdn4aa	hmm...5 weeks is an awfully long time to still have enough HCG to register on a preg. test.  Have you had sex?  I would wait one week and test again.  If the test shows positive but the line is lighter than last time, you probably aren't pregnant, otherwise...GOOD LUCK!!|`|7pJ8S0Liaa	YES!|`|QJDbG1F1aa	Not normally, although the HCG hormone drastically decreases after the baby is born, 5 weeks later is a little odd.|`|8be367fe78353833dcfd48377d2502ecaa	I would say yes, it could....|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Pregnancy tests these days are usually very sensitive, according to my doctor.  They are more likely to give false negatives than false positives.  If you're asking about a test you took, you should get re-tested at the doctor's.

BW7Nrqjzaa	The pump will never do as good of a job stimulating your supply and demand reflex as your baby will. So your milk will slowly decrease. You should try nursing your baby whenever possible and pumping when you can't nurse.   Also pumping while you nurse is great for upping your supply. You basically trick your body into to thinking your feeding twins!  You can also try things like fenugreek and oatmeal. Both are suppose to help with supply issues.  Good luck and congratulations on giving your little one a great start in life!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	The pump just doesn't take out enough milk for most women to keep there supply up. I don't have any friends that made it more than a couple months pumping exclusively. The LC is right. You will need to pump every 2-3hrs if pumping is all you do.    You can try to put your baby back on the breast and after a while your supply should go back up. Fenugreek supplements, mothers milk tea, lots of water, and oatmeal may help as well.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	maybe you can keep some of the feedings with you, like the morning and evening ones.. and the daytime can be pumped milk.. this might help a bit with supply.|`|pOsnTnimaa	drink lots and lots of water    i wonder have you decided to feed with a bottle due to problems latching etc..?  if so theres a lot you can do to elp this.    also i noticed with me that if i used a breast pump, the milk doesnt come out as well as if you used your hand to express.    i think if you express with your hand , its better    well done on giving your baby the best
ItS4VZrEaa	I heard that someone women have a problem where their own body tricks them into thinking their pregant. A phantom pregnancy or something. You have all the signs and feelings but nothings actually there.    Im not doctor, im just 15 but id just thought id mention that to see if you want to look into it or something. x|`|K2jT1z5jaa	Congratulations!!    Change your doctor i thnk. that is enough proof.    god bless x|`|T48smu01aa	your doctor seems like a dim wit haha although I had the same thing I took 7 test and then I took a urine test at my doctors and she said why do you think your pregnant and I told her b/c I got 7 positive haha why else would I be here and then she said well your not and she was going to send me home and then I said well I want a blood test so I did one and she called me 2 days later to tell me I was very pregnant....you know your body so I think your pregnant I don't like doctors....anyways CONGRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I think your pregnant.|`|780ByZVEaa	congratulations!!!|`|441426548c68616e3f95f9bea48548e5aa	if the one you took at the doctors came out + then most likely you are... some of the Store Bought tests don't work like they sayd they do but I really think you are and are you haveing any of the Symptoms?|`|VUss5AfAaa	oh your def pregnant..you must be 2 months already i say about 8-9 weeks.    you should get an ultrasound to check if you got a embryo.|`|QJDbG1F1aa	Pregnant, unless you are self injecting hcg.|`|CA06qy8Laa	I think you are pregnant!|`|HGeN6LqDaa	I think you're going to have a baby. Congrats! I would seek a second opinion from a different doctor.|`|zsBViFcSaa	I think that you're pregnant. It's kind of unlikely that nine pregnancy tests would lie. Try going to another doctor, because the one you're seeing right now obviously doesn't know what he/she is talking about. Lol.     I hope I helped and good luck, girl! =)|`|LDYAGJCxaa	I think you need a new dr!  I'm pretty sure 9 positive results would mean you're pregnant.  Have him order a blood test since he's so skeptical and start looking for a better doctor.  Congrats!  :)|`|OoaZGumxaa	Get a new doctor! One that will take the time to do blood work and possibly an Ultra sound. That's what I would do in your situation. Your doctor should be preparing you for a healthy pregnancy and baby not doubting you or the tests. Good luck!|`|AA12356061	i am not a girl but if you have been having alot of sex that may have a factor in being prego and if you are still not sure stick your hand up and see if you can feel a baby and if you can than u are prego and no problem i am  1 when it comes to advice|`|0XXM4U5Zaa	I think your doctor needs a good kick in the head.  I do have PCOS and frankly, I've never heard of it causing a positive pregnancy test when there wasn't a pregnancy.   The only positives I've ever had are now being very loud and rowdy in the other room......|`|Wc3Vge9taa	congrats mommy to be!!!|`|jZPv153Jaa	i think that the doctor should know that you prob, are prego because you arent takin ang hormonal medicine . . . rite? if you're not takin them than you are pregnant.
7a9f64ab092ef95531aefb8d05659307aa	there is a less than 1 percent chance. but someone in my classes mom got her tubes tied and found out she was pregnant. so there is a possibility... you should go get an ultra sound because it could b stuck in ur fallopian tubes and the baby can grow in there and get to big and burst ur tube and you can bleed to death.        HOPE I HELPED!! GOOD LUCK!! :)        |`|FGjanFY1aa	That's how my sister is here today!    My mother had her tubes tied, then along came my sister. My mother calls her the Miracle Child.|`|i88MbPB3aa	you still can get pregnant after getting tubes tie take a test
VS8mactUaa	Dont wait around for a man to run your life, you go and get on with your life! Just tell him If he wants to be apart of the family, either do it or beat it. You are a woman! Powerful and strong, just keep your head up.! Go and enjoy life!|`|pKr77Vqiaa	Stop letting him play you, leave him and move on.|`|TGlWnFjxaa	I personally think you should.. Walk away... Lets see how far you go til he realizes your not there... Just keep your relationship as friends for you baby' s sake... It seems to me he doesnt want to settle down... and you being a responsible adult do for your child... Move on.. You deserve to be happy too...|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Go on with your life honey not worth your time.|`|pWvLAPC6aa	I personally think you should move on with your life. Waiting for him to grow up and become a man and be with you both as a family is going to be just that a bunch of waiting. If he wanted to be with you both and be a family he would have done so by now. I know it hurts especially if you love him but take it from someone who knows they won't change just because you want them too. I wish you and your baby the best!! God Bless You!!|`|qiyLq6CRaa	MOVE ON GIRL DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HE'S PLAYING GAMES WITH YOU.  HE WILL ALWAYS BE IN YOUR LIFE BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK IF HE IS THE RIGHT MAN FOR YOU.  YOU NEED TO TALK TO HIM IF HE'S SEEING OTHER PEOPLE THEN GIRL GO DO YOUR OWN THING.
JDw1RDcaaa	everybody keeps saying all the sickness i has having i was properly having twins but when i went for a scan at 14 weeks they said there was only one, but someone i work with was told she was only having one until week 27 where they found two heart beats and then they found she was having twins so if u feel like u are having twins then make sure they dig to assure you are is only one|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    Could possibly be twins. but maybe a boy this time since you already have a 3 year old girl . Pregnancy symptoms are diferent.    god bless x|`|zSABr7praa	Everyone was convinced I was having twins, even my own mother.  When I called everyone to tell them the sex of my ONE little girl everyone was like "that's it?"  "just one??"  It made me feel REALLY bad, like one wasn't good enough!  It could be twins, or you could be having a rough first trimester, either way don't get your hopes up, just keep your fingers crossed for healthy :):)  Best of luck!|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	I showed faster with my second and having a child to chase around will make this pregnancy very different than your first.  I don't think it sounds like twins, just a typical second pregnancy.|`|7cvoxQitaa	Every pregnancy is different, just like every child is!! Having a 3 year old, is tiring enough, and adding a new pregnancy on top, is defiantly cause for additional fatigue! Do twins run in the family? If they do, you may be blessed times 2!! 12 days seems forever, understandable, but, it's kinda fun to speculate!! Congrats!!|`|gyoylefvaa	Dawn congratulation you're having twins or triples.
BNAzjSO1aa	Ask them if they can smell the cigarettes on great grandmothers clothes? When they say yes say that is what can KILL  Bella. I am not taking the risk with her life good luck and stand up to them your child is more important than hurting others feelings  A story that might help you explain for a tv documentary on nut allergies the reporter takes a nut allergy sufferer into a pub where no one was eating nuts and sit him so he can not see anyone in the bar after about 2o minutes he starts to have problems breathing and has to leave the reporter walks around the bar and finds someone who has opened a packet of nuts within the last few minutes , there was no way the sufferer could have seen or heard the packet being opened and the barman confirmed it was the only packet he had sold in the previous half hour.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Well you know, there is going to be cigarette smoke and residue on people all over the place..everywhere you go and she is not going to be able to avoid it ever.  This sounds like something that may be a problem for her for her entire life.  Sorry, but you can't expect people all over the place to accomodate your childs needs.  I do understand as a mother, your concern is not the other people but your child.  However, that being said, it is you and your child with the problem and you aren't going to be able to get rid of all the cigarettes and people smelling of cigarettes so you need to adapt.  You need to talk to the specialist about finding a way your daughter can be around these people and not be affected.  Maybe its a special med or special all around treatment or a mask or something, but that is what you need to work out.    Thumbs down!  Well I guess this lady must find a way to get rid of every trace of cigarette smoke from the world.,|`|U9pnPXnpaa	You just tell them that going to a birthday party is not worth killing your daughter.  That's what I had to do when my son was young - cats put him in the hospital immediately.       Being blunt is sometimes the only way to make people "get it".|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Unfortunately some people just don't believe it till they see it.  My stepsis used to make our parents change shirts to hold her babies after they had smoked because her twins had been premature.  They later developed allergies and asthma around 3 years old.  I thought she was being silly at the time, going overboard, but looking back, she did what she had to do AND put up with some of us thinking she was silly and I'm sure some even had worse thoughts.    You do what you have to do to protect your child and perhaps it wouldn't be a bad idea to get a pamplet or look online for some info that you can print out and give to the relatives.    Good Luck!|`|AA10730513	While she isn't near as sensitive to it as your daughter, my little girl is bothered by smoke and smoke residue too. (My grandmother and I are too.)    I have pretty much given up on convincing people that I know what I'm talking about. They will agree that it doesn't smell good. But it doesn't bother them to the point of being a medical problem, so they don't understand how it could bother someone else to that point.     People think I am raising my daughter to be stuck up or that I am taking her complaints too seriously. I will admit that she is a little dramatic about how much it affects her. But I have noticed ... When she spends more time around her father and her uncle (who smoke a lot, but they don't smoke around her) she is more prone to getting upper respiratory infections. Her health is important. I will not compromise it on a regular basis just to avoid being seen as stuckup by the inlaws.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	They don't really have to understand it or believe it.  You can keep trying to explain, especially if you value the relationships and you feel that this is hurting the relationships.      But, in the end, if they allow their ignorance to ruin the relationship, was it really worth saving anyway?  Would you want to maintain relationships with people who thought you were exaggerating or who didn't care about your child's health & safety?  Are those really the kind of people you want to be spending time with?      I remember my BIL's wedding, when my then 3yo milk-allergic son was the ring-bearer.  He was across the room from me, talking to some teens from the other family.  I saw them handing something to him & ran across the room, snatching m&m's out of his hand.      They thought I was crazy.  Some nutty mom who won't let her kid have just a little bit of candy...      I don't care.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I simply wouldn't take my child to homes where people have smoked. It's not a big deal, in my opinion. Just don't go. They don't have to understand why, they just have to understand that you won't allow it. Plain and simple.|`|AA10186411	Tell them the truth.  If they don't like it, oh well.  Whats important is yuor child's health.  People rarely don't understand that when it comes to my daughter's asthma either.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	It is a very unfortunate situation for you and the grandmother however, your child's health comes first and if the doctor said so, well, then blame it on the doctor. You can not explain anything to stubborn people, keep that in mind always ! Tell the old lady: "the doctor said so and we all love Bella way too much, don't we?" There is no other way to put this. Be blunt !!!!!!!!|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I would just tell them, plain & simple. "Bella is severely allergic to smoke and smoke residue. She will have a severe asthma attack and i do not want my daughter going through that again. I've spoken with her doctor and he suggested that we not attend the party for Bella's health safety."|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	okay icky situation no if ands or buts.  have you talked to great grandma?  what does she say? i get shes probably old and set in her ways but she can't be dumb, right?  everyone who smokes knows its bad.  can great grandma make an exception for her great grand daughter?  i know my grandmother would give her right arm for my daughter.  heck shed do it for me.    i would have a heart to heart with her myself.  im one of those people who think knowing such an extended family is important.  maybe my own personal family makes me that way but i do.  i actually have a picture of my daughter with her great great grandfather.  how cool is that?  if she doesn't see reason then she can't be as important as i'd like to think she should be.  any reasonable adult should think of the child first, addiction second.    my two cents.    EDIT - oh that stinks.  then you gotta do whats best for Bella.  its sad that, that lady can't see past the end of her nose for her great granddaughter.  but you know what its her loss, completely and totally.  don't go at all.  the others should still understand.  its sad that no one can stand up to the lady.
AA10992439	Their parents need to tear their little butts apart.  I don't care what you weird people who don't believe in corporal punishment say... Spare the rod and spoil the child!  That is UNACCEPTABLE. I bet if your kids pissed you off bad enough you'd beat their little butts.  Kids don't listen to your little rants and "time outs" aren't that bad.  And then stupid parents who send their kids to their room... What in hell are you thinking?  They're not gonna go think about what they did wrong.. Ugh, you people really ARE dumb.  Spank those children, parents!   No, I did NOT say beat. I said SPANK.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Desmeran stole my answer      "Usually kids who know they would have their butts beaten don't try crap like this."......  That is absurd.  I strongly disagree.  The problem is much deeper than you suggest.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	not my reaction.  my reaction is there are kids who desperately need psychological help, and who may have been abused themselves or witnessed abuse.      eta -- really? you have any statistics on that? because the vast majority of kids, spanked or not, wouldn't do that, and the statistics i've seen are actually the other way around:  that kids who are spanked are statistically slightly more likely than other kids to be aggressive (not that all spanked kids are aggressive, obviously).|`|snUDfcfgaa	Desmeran is correct though it may be too late.  I see little budding sociopaths.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	its not the discipline method.  its consistency.  i didn't do stuff like that because my mom spanked me until i was 4.  i didnt do stuff like that because I knew better.  i had sense.  that doesn't come from spanking.  i don't spank my kids, they still no better than to misbehave.  why?  i'm consistent.  don't confuse the method with the outcome|`|PlmT4lHXaa	My first reaction would be the same thing.. if I saw those kids I'd want to kill them for being so mean!!!     But realistically, its not a spanking that they need, its some therapy!! Those kids are messed up. I'm not saying they shouldn't get punished, but they really do need help.|`|NysFTExhaa	I'm another one that agrees with Des.  In my training this is a major sign of psychological problems that have a tendency to escalate into bigger problems later in their lives.  No matter if you spank a kid or not, a normal kid will not do this.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	For sure. I didn't read that whole article because I can't stand cruelty to anything or anyone, but that's sick|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Those parents are also responsible. Those kids should be beaten and sent to juvy to never see anyone or the light of day again|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	I am with Des here too - it's highly unlikely that kids who are ok with doing that have led normal lives.|`|zHRWklEWaa	I'm also with Des. People don't go around torturing animals unless something is seriously wrong, it isn't just simple disrespect for authority. I'd like to see these children get serious help before they cause more serious harm.|`|PQXiXEZKaa	KICK THAT KIDS @SS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      what losers. they don't have anything better to do that hurt poor innocent animals?     reminds me of that hateful kid in butterfly effect that burns that dog.     but then again that was a movie. sometimes real life is cruler than anything you'd find in a movie.      add: even if the kids were "abused" they should know that burning animals is wrong and disgusting if the kids were abused why would they take it out on innocent dogs?  its not the dogs fault the kids have stupid parents.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	While I don't condone violence, I believe that they do need serious help. When I was a senior 3 or 4 girls dipped cat's tails in gasoline and set them on fire. They had mandatory counseling and were automatically removed from extracurricular activities. (They brought the photos to school to show off.) The year after I graduated, one of our rival schools had several boys trespass onto a farm and slaughter sheep and lambs. They, on the other hand, received no punishment because their father's contributed financially to the school. That just wasn't right.|`|OuA2cQ8haa	if i found thous kids i would beat the living **** out of them and if they were my child? i would beat the **** out of them , then lock them in a mental institute for the next 10 years|`|9s9Baglyaa	Who would do such a thing? Trying to burn puppies is like trying to burn a human being! Those kids must be a little kookoo in the brain.....|`|2ObqoJbKaa	omg. Thats so horrible. I can't believe people can be that cruel in life. Its disgusting. Glad the puppies are ok tho.|`|4ZktwobSaa	god these kids should be on jail i dint care how old are they..  they're nuts!!|`|GOMThToVaa	Never Mind!

I'm sorry dear.   Yes, that's good you are being positive!!  Atleast it didn't take weeks for AF to show.  That means you'll be ovulating sooner!  =)  Take it easy and load up on the ice cream!|`|6igjX2cnaa	awww I'm so sorry hun!

I'm sorry AF showed her ugly face; just look at it this way:  time to start BDing soon and it is fun trying to make a baby ;)    No BFP for me yet.  I *may* be ovulating right now, but I'm trying not to think about it, ya know?  Just gettin busy whenever we feel like it and concentrating on each other!!    xoxoxoxo|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. I am sorry you got your AF. Ill keep u in my prayers and lets hope that Feb is your month!!!!!! |`|xpstigPTaa	i'm so sorry you got AF...you know how I have been looking at it for the past few months? The quicker I get AF, the quicker we cant start trying again. I have been thinking that way to avoid and emotional crash every single month when she shows her ugly face. Fingers crossed that February is your month...stay positive because it will happen for us. Truck loads of baby dust to you!!!!!!!!!
PZ44zMWAaa	I would take a test or call the doctor and see if you can come in for a test there.  They can even do a blood test that is more accurate than urine.  Good luck.|`|SzNmGV0Daa	Yes as long as it's not RED or PINK. Brownish blood is old blood, not new menstral blood. Goodluck|`|q5MGxuyaaa	Very good... brown usually can be implantation spotting, and white creamy discharge is common in pregnancy.  If you are late, you can take an hpt and find out for sure!  Goodluck!!|`|cc3bc74da528c9ab08e77b61000dc40faa	wait another week then call the Dr. it may be too early for a preg test to come back positive, but they can do a blood test. Good Luck|`|O810hUs2aa	i really don't know what to tell you i had that at the beginning if my miscarriage so i don't know if normally u should have discharge that color at the beginning it was clear and white i hope for the best for you and your hubby
a397f673797d99b21b2a87fa4d66988baa	Been there myself, you are right in the feeling of not telling her anything bad about her dad, even if true. Never tell a child half of them is bad, she will learn on her own as she gets older what type of dad she has, even if it means on that never comes around.     You can start by not telling her yourself that daddy is going to come see her.  If daddy calls, you can ask him not to say he is coming if he does not plan on it, and tell him why.  If she asks for daddy, a little white lie of daddy has to work and cant come see you right now should work, tell her daddy loves you.  I agree the less you tell her the better.    I know how hard it is believe me I raised 2 girls now 18 and 19 without their dad around much. You will have lots of tears to deal with I am sure, now and as your baby girl gets older. It will break your heart, it will hurt her heart, but you both get through it.     If you have a positive male role model you can expose your daughter too do so, my girls and I were fortunate that my dad and brother were very involved in our lives, my brother (uncle steve) was a major part and a very good role model.     Wipe her tears, tell her mommy loves you and daddy loves you too, he just cant come see you right now.    As she gets older you can be a little more detailed abouth the why daddy is not around but still no negative about him, she will resent you for telling her bad things about her dad. like i said she will learn on her own what type of dad she has, and who knows maybe dad will come to his sences and realize what he is missing.    Good luck and stay srong mommy.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Since he has never really been there for her, I think she may be picking up on YOUR hurt and distress...she is too young to understand any of it...only that Daddy not being there for her is making YOU sad....I suggest you really think about if you have let her see your sadness...and then try to change it all...when she next talks about him try to act upbeat or positive...say "Oh he's very busy!" and then suggest doing something she loves doing...like painting or whatever....change the subject...she will stop associating him with you being hurt. All the best of luck....she only needs one caring parent and she's got it in you....she'll be fine!|`|th45yP4Xaa	I would tell her that Daddy has to go away for a little while. You should tell him to atleast call her because she loves and cries for him.|`|OsnCPSsoaa	This is a really hard situation.  I think you should just drop it and never bring him up again and she will eventually forget.|`|llTqn0Tbaa	what i would do is that tell her that he is out on a "trip"  but make it somewhat believeable  but tell her the truth when you feel that she is mentally mature|`|YFTZM86maa	Do NOT speak ill of him.  I hope that you have taken matters to court for child support. Chances are far better that he will want more contact if he's paying for his child.  Reassure her that you are there for her.  You might say things like daddy is out of town, or other ways of saying that he is away.  Things like that can be true as well as something that she can understand.  Your personal feelings are not to be shared with her.  You need to be the bigger person and not do that to her.  What about her grandparents and other relatives?  Be that they are on his side of the family or yours, a phone call from one of them may take her mind off of things.|`|AA11920812	Aw, big (((HUGS))) you know. I know this has to be TERRIBLE for you to watch. While my husband and I aren`t divorced he travels a LOT. And, when he is in town its at the university to finish his MBA.    So, I hear the same things, daddy, I want daddy (esepcially when being disciplined) or they stare out the window watching for daddy. Playing I spy daddy`s car...they are almost 3 and 2...one night my husband was working in the basement (he is finishing it by himself) after a business trip and being gone at class for two nights. And, my oldest had a break down. Sincere break down. Crying I want my daddy. I want my daddy. I need my daddy. Just a broken little boy. It was the hardest thing to watch.     I tell them that daddy went bye bye. Daddys at work. Daddys bye bye at school.  Be truthful yet simple, Daddy is busy. Daddy is playing with his friends.Maybe you could dial the phone and have her leave him a message to satisfy her curiosity?Something like, Daddy I love and I miss you. Call me.    For your part could you call his mom/dad?    Terrible that he can`t be there for her.|`|0bPUAho5aa	aww expalin to ur baby the truth|`|ZjiEQ3CGaa	tell her that her daddy lives far away so its hard for him to come visit her and that wear he lives the phones dont work|`|76SAdZ19aa	Say "Daddy went to get a great job and have lots of money so he can buy you everything you want." Say this cheerfully     AND when she gets old enough to understand lots of things, tell her her dad and you didn't love each other anymore.|`|GLnVPp2Caa	I understand where you are coming from.  My hubby and I split up when my kids were 3 and 18 months respectively.    There were soooo many times that he said he was coming for a visit, but then never showed up, so I started protecting their hearts since they are the reason I left in the first place.    The daddy phase will pass and she will learn that mommy is always there for her, as did my kids.    I have heard that cry and thought to myself, Daddy is not going to fix this for you, but I bite my tongue and just hold them instead.    You can't fix this missing daddy situation, but you can be the best mom you can be.    Just plod along and it will pass as she gets more and more used to not hearing from him.    Hugs to you.|`|PRaTLk8laa	Does she ever see him?  I wonder if she doesn't call out for him to spite you sometimes if she is upset with you.  My son has started that and his father and I are still married.  My son is 2 1/2 and now only wants daddy.  I think if you just tell her that Daddy and Mommy are having a hard time getting along and sometimes when that happens we get upset with each other but that has nothing to do with how much we love you.  Or Daddy has been very busy and either can't talk to you as much or see you as much.  I feel bad for her and you but just be honest without being disrespectful.  I am a child of divorce and my mother never said anything to me...I just saw it for myself.  She will eventually know that you are there for her always!
Jo2DfRzaaa	I think hollywood is the same as the media.  i view them as one and the same in my mind.  i think they are strictly for entertainment purposes.  i think they also need to come w/a disclaimer from me.  a lot of what goes on in hollywood doesn't bother me, i mean it does, but i don't find the majority of a direct influence on my kids (yes i know they are young, but even as the get older, i am still the parent).  i have the biggest issue with the way that woman are perceived by the media in general.  i don't like the box that put woman in to be beautiful.  for me i find that most detrimental to young girls.  that impacts everything - the clothes stores sell, the people on the cover of magazines, who is cast in television shows and movies, the singers and bands that play music.  every single woman is subjected to that standard of beauty.  i personally find it disgusting.  that is what concerns me the most.  i think it is what affects girls the most too.  i hope that i can install self esteem and self worth in my girl.  i hope i can explain the magic of photoshop.  real beauty is inside.  everyone else' opinion doesn't count, its just hers.  thats my soap box for the day.  enjoy.  :-)|`|TrBoPj92aa	Do you mean the movies or the celebrities?  My daughter is 9 and due to peer pressure i feel like i have to let her watch 12's as all her friends do, i think after the movie's that are "older" she tries to be a little like the prettiest girl in the movie but it only lasts a day or two! ie in mean girls she started speaking like Regina and walking like her!    As for celebrities i don't let my daughter frequently by magazines but she buys them once a month and she likes the OK magazine as she likes the fashion, after she reads that she tries to dress really nicely but generally gives up the next day!!    Maisey x|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I don't think it really affects them more than any other outside influence in the world.       The world is full of ideas, information, personalities, people - all unique -my kids know that, in the end, they alone are responsible for the decisions they make in their lives.      We don't try to control what the kids are exposed to.  We try to help them figure out how to react to & deal with it all.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I'm in Los Angeles, we're obsessed with everything Hollywood. I worked in a movie studio and it's beyond obsessive there.    The super skinny girls that they put everywhere are sending the wrong message.    The shows that they put out are getting riskier at a younger age    Our obsession with celebrities is terrible, I am guilty I LOVE tmz and  the gossip rags, we're immersed in it.    I kept her away from the studio, out of the politics, away from modeling when she was pursued, TV isn't an issue yet, but it will be monitored and regulated by me.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	Don't let your children watch movies you don't approve of. Simple as that.|`|j2mRop0laa	I don't really even think about it, even though I have a very trendy daughter that wants to be a fashion designer. lol   I am always telling her she might want to think of some other things, too, because it is a cut throat business. I don't know if she was influenced by fashion through the little bit of celebrities she has heard of or seen or if she just really always loved it (which seems to be the case).   The youngest definitely has a mind of her own and I don't worry about her being influenced by anyone, celebrity or otherwise. She constantly tells me she wants to be unique and different and she doesn't want to act/dress/look like anyone but herself. I admire it.    The only time I control it is if I see one of them commenting something negatively. For example, we were in a check out line and my ten year looks at a Star Magazine cover with Jessica Simpson and said," Omg why are they calling her fat?!" I told her society seems to have a sick image of what celebrities should look like and pointed out that I thought she was beautiful through all her weight changes. It isn't our business what the girl weighs!  Also, at school last year she heard a lot of Britney bashing, in her class. I put a stop to that right away.    ETA: Oh, I have banned MTV from my house, altogether. I find it sexist and dirty. All of my daughters friends watch it. Even the one with the Playboy bunnies. Disgusting. They are 10!|`|r07BwhO1aa	This is the thing, for some reason we are a culture of star  uckers, everything they say and do is better than you in every way, I think parents need to remember that people who are in the entertainment business are still people, and not perfect.     NOW with that being said stars who are kid friendly but then decide they want to not be so kid friendly (Hanna Montana is reaching that age) can not just jump over to being non-kid friendly and hope that parents take it lightly.      I remember when Brittney Spear's sister got pregnant, my daughter loved Zoey 101, did I make her stop watching it?  No.  My daughter who was  7 at the time heard she got pregnant and we talked about it but in the end my daughter knows that Zoey is not a real person, and that the person playing her is a real person with real problems, who can make very bad choices.    I think if parents sit and talk with their kids they would be very surprised to learn they understand more than we give them credit for.
85V6cHe4aa	No i don't,i live in the uk but of course we have a system here in place for those that need it and of course there will be people who do abuse it but seriously its a minority.    Its sad that anyone in need might get tarred with the same brush,most people only use the system when they truly need to-people lose jobs,lose partners,are left unsupported become ill etc and the system is truly a valuable one to have in place to help those in need.    Most people have great pride and want to work and popping out babies to get support is a strange concept,its blooming hard work having and raising children so whilst a few abuse it most would have more sense.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	no but there are some people that do abuse it that makes the people that actually need it look bad.  no a lot of them want to go work and wish they did not have to be on any welfare. but there are people like that that make every one look like that?|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I think really most of them are just stuck in their situation. Welfare doesnt pay that good so having babies just to get a check from the government.. no, that baby costs more than what the check is wrote out to...   I'm sure there is some people who dont care that they are living in the projects and just spend their money on cars and clothes but I think mostly its just people in bad situations, no need to start sterilizing nobody  edit. we dont get a check but my kids get medicaid and wic, the reason I dont go to work is because my whole paycheck would go to pay for the childcare. No point there... Maybe next year when my daughter is two and the rates go down a little|`|r39EDGhPaa	My mom is on welfare and we get food stamps, she hasn't had children in 16 years and she only has two children.    She is sick, she got fired from her job because she missed too much due to doctors appointments.  Job hunting isn't going over so well for her, and she needs to pay the rent and put food in our mouths somehow.  My cousin and uncle live with us too, so I even had to get a job to help out.    My mom definitely isn't a horrible parent.  She's fantastic, and if anyone honestly believes that people on welfare are horrible people, then they need a reality check.      No I do not believe that one bit.  I know that people do pop out tons of babies so that they can get government assistance, but that's not the case for everyone.  Every situation is different.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	I can't really say that I know enough people on welfare to get a good idea of how people use it.    I know there are some who abuse it, and others who are doing their best... so I don't make a judgement automatically when I hear that someone is recieving assistance, at least I try my best not too.    My personal opinion is not nessessarily that people on welfare are "lazy", its more of just poor planning (in SOME not ALL cases). For example, having a child when you clearly don't have the means to is poor planning. I think you should dig yourself out of the hole first. And I think more people should try to take advantage of college or higher education to get a better job- which doesn't always work out, but it helps to have a degree in most cases.    There is my two cents :)|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I think it really depends on the situation.    It is not a "black OR white" type of deal.Its pretty grey.      Not everyone has a luxery of being a stay at home mom and having your husband support the family.    Some people lose their jobs after they have kids...some before.    Some are constantly popping kids off just to get more money     etc. etc. etc.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't believe it for one second, i know there are people like this out there..in fact i know a few myself. But there are people that get help and work very hard to take care of themselves and their children financially.  I myself am not eligible for like food stamps, medicaid, but my kids are.. i also get wic for 2 of my children. It helps out a lot, as i'm not working right now, and if i was working all of my money would be going towards paying for day care. My boyfriend is working 40 hours a week making a decent wage..but not a huge one. Sometimes people just need help. I pay taxes just as everyone else does..so who cares if i'm getting help, especially if i'm one of the people paying into it all!|`|gxGsqNPPaa	I wouldn't quite put it in the words you use, but I DO believe that the majority of people receiving assistance are abusing it, and are certainly not making the kind of changes in their lives they need to make to not need it anymore. Not all of them, but most.      My opinion is just that: my opinion. I base my opinion on things I have personally witnessed. And the majority of people on any kind of assistance that I have seen or known personally have been abusers of it. Lazy, with the kind of "Why get a job when I don't have to because I'm given all this free money" attitude. And still they want more. I know people right now who don't believe the government gives them enough because they have 5 kids and deserve more. So statistically "majority" may not be correct, but what i have witnessed is more than enough to make "majority" the reality of my opinion.    Of course, I hope I'm wrong  :)|`|izZqdgazaa	I think that the system makes it difficult for single moms or parents with low incomes to work because child care is too expensive. If your entire checks goes to pay for, thee is no point. Childcare should be free, that way there would be no initiative to stay at home receiving welfare. More taxes would be generated for those who are unable to work for physical or mental reasons. I also think more funding should go into planned parenthood to make sure that parents are both emotionally and financially ready for children. I am also for a "two children per couple" policy. If you want a bigger family - adopt. That's my two cents.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I would not think that the majority of people on assistance are lazy. I am sure that there are some that are abusing the system but some people need it and are honest about it. Everyone should not be looked down on for the handful of slime balls that don't need it or abuse the sysytem.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I honestly don't know. I would like to think that very few of those people exist, but I don't know firsthand. I was on Medicaid and had WIC for 3 months. My hubby had been laid of work twice in less than a year and I had such a rough pregnancy I couldn't work. We went through some difficult times but moved to a big city, found decent jobs, and turned our lives around. We are now expecting our 2nd and with no assistance at all this time. I would rather people take the time to look for a job and look to better themselves than stagnate for the rest of their lives.|`|5ca74cb9e6d3604c2c41d86d59b901beaa	i personally dont think they ar all lazy or dont want a job..i know in most cases if you want cash assistance, in New York, your butt has to go to job training...you have to work for the assistance..then there are some people who take advantage and unfortunatley in these heavy times when people really need it...all the funds to help arent available,.|`|FgVvTnyOaa	Sadly enough these are great programs that can do so much good, and then there are people who take advantage of it. My neighbor is on food stamps and he's a very loud alcoholic, i overheard him say "$100 in food stamps for food, $100 dollars in food stamps for BEER" and it sickens me because my husband and i are spending all our income to pay off debt and bills, and do not have money for extras for our little boy, and here is this drunk idiot using the system. Give us the $100, and we could buy some diapers.|`|vJEatJFPaa	Someone will always be out there abusing the system.    Right now these are hard times for everyone.....Think about all these job lay offs..people losing their paychecks along with health care...I right now am searching hard for a job. I work the health care field and Im baffled by the amount of apps I've filled out and the slim responses I've got. And I have 4 years experience in my field. We all pay tax $ to have these services so if we all are ever in a bad situation, we can have assistance. Yes, we all deserve assistance until we get back on our feet. But no, people should not keep sitting on their asses to get everything handed to them.    I know personally of a couple who does do what angers you and everybody else.|`|X3zl9hZCaa	I believe it because I've seen it! Not everyone does this of course but my friends ex has 3 kids and shes 26 and married and her husband collects disability and he fakes it and she gets medicaid...welfare...and food stamps...she has no excuse not to work...she has all her arms and legs like the rest of us!|`|hl5WdXnbaa	There was a very good article yesterday on line...and I can't find it!!!    But anyways it talks about the poor and those on welfare and how we as a society like to look down on them and give them such a negative stereotype when in fact most are hard working people who just feel into hard times.     It makes a point that most low wage or entry level jobs are not family friendly . The hours can be all over the place...making finding child care impossible. We do not live in a 9-5 , monday to friday world...yet most day cares operate that way. These jobs often do not provide any benefits such as sick days, medical care. These jobs often pay less than what a person earns on welfare.      And it talks about how more and more low paying jobs are being taken by those with higher education. People with college degrees are working as cashiers and retail workers more and more because they can not get jobs in their field. It is more likely that your cashier at Walmart has a BA, then is a high school drop out. So that pushes out the less educated from those jobs.     I am going to search for it again... to  have on hand for those who think everyone on welfare is a bum... because it makes some good points . I guess if you never been poor or on welfare it is hard to understand why working you way up can be so hard.|`|74mDvMJraa	Yes. I have met more than enough people to believe this is the case. There are probably very few people who think about what they are doing in those terms, but they do that. They don't feel like getting out and getting a job. It's more fun to stay home and watch movies. They are not necessarily horrible parents, just flawed ones training their children that the government owes them money. Yes childcare is expensive, but I have to say that I don't believe it should be free. If it were, stay at home moms would be taking advantage of it for no reason. You know it's true, I think everyone has met someone who would do this in their lifetime. I don't know if they are the majority, but they are an issue to society and the economy. Who knew that all the government assistance started after the Great Depression would lead to leeches? It serves a purpose, but they should be more selective. If a person is capable of working and just doesn't and there's no real reason that they cannot, then they don't deserve  federal money. If a person gets a job at McDonald's and they just don't make enough money to support themselves, then okay. Help them. That's just my opinion. If a person can do more for themselves than they are, then helping them is a waste of money. I understand disabilities and single parents or even parents who just don't make enough money, but not laziness.    Also, when people get government aid and they spend all of their income on wasteful things like huge flat panel televisions and things equally unnecessary, then, the government should take away some of the money they are receiving. If they are wasting their money on stupid things instead of at least trying to save money, then they are undeserving.    The government needs to also try and find ways to just help needy children for when their parents are wasteful lazy slobs or whatever they may be when they don't deserve these extra dollars. It's not the child's fault so they shouldn't be punished. I'm not saying they need to be given unnecessary items, but they shouldn't starve or go without clothing and at least some means.    One final thing, why does everyone believe that they deserve help when things get rough? Yes, it's nice to have, but DESERVE? What have we ever done to deserve to be taken care of by the government? Yes, we pay taxes, and yes, we do jury duty, but they provide protection for the country and create jobs, along with helping to make sure society works properly. We create our own path in this world, and to say that someone else is entitled to take care of us, when we chose the point we are at now whether we knew where it would take us or not, is wrong. I don't want you to think that I'm some rich person saying this from my mansion and living the easy life. I'm not, in fact, I have about 600 dollars to my name. I don't come from a wealthy family. They are indebted so far that they may never see the end of it, they don't make a lot of money, yet they've always done what they could for me and my siblings. I'm in school right now trying to get a bachelor's degree and when my four years are up, I very well may not have a job available to me. I may end up working at McDonald's myself, but I will avoid state aid until I am practically starving to death. That's how I feel about it and I'm not saying that you should necessarily agree.|`|Q7jMH5praa	No I don't think that the majority of people abuse these systems. I receive $323 in food stamps a month and WIC helps with my son's formula. My hubby and I have both been looking for jobs. I turned in a stack of at least 20 applications so far and no one has called me back.     Before the economy went to hell I never dreamed I would need any assistance from the government. I had a great job and so did my husband. We just fell into hard times. A lot of people have had the same thing happen to them. Most end up getting their lives back together and stop receiving assistance. There are a few that do mooch off the government but not many.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	no.    most people would rather have a lot more to live off of than what they could get off of public assistance.  most parents would want their children to have more than that.  and most people have a drive to be useful, productive, respected, and with a strong sense of self-esteem.  i don't believe large numbers of people are using benefits "just for the fun of it" ... because it sure doesn't look fun to me.|`|TQW5E6olaa	No, I do not believe that of the majority. It's kinda like the single mom stigma, people hear multiple stories about the bad ones so people assume every single mom is like that. Same goes with people on government aid.    I'm not so ignorant to assume that's what everyone is like. I've heard some bad stories, but I've seen some good ones too and where have I heard them from- the media, or other people.     Oh and people hiding behind "statistics" can kiss it, if I ever want something to go a certain way, I know how to choose a group and neighborhood to acomplish my purpose|`|AA11210211	I wouldn't say majority as a whole but in certain states the majority are like that.I grew up on welfare,food stamps and state medical BUT my mom worked her tail off to support me and my brother she never sat on her behind and did nothing.She worked 2 jobs and still needed help,but there were a couple years there where we got no state assistance.|`|j2mRop0laa	I have seen both types. I know a few of the children that I do volunteer work with have parents that are just lazy. BUT, it is a cycle. They are uneducated and unmotivated and I really hope they don't pass it on to their kids.  I also know a nurse, her hubby was a cop and got injured on the job. She had to go down to Part-time to take care of him, he got disability and they had to apply for food stamps etc. She cried to me about it. She was embarrassed and it hurt her pride.   I suspect it's 50/50. And because of the 50% that receive it because they NEED it, I'm Okay with the programs. Sure people abuse it, but we don't close down stores because people steal. People will abuse EVERYTHING. There's always some of them out there. We don't ban marriages because some people cheat.   I'm a big supporter of public assistance. I think even the people that are uneducated and *brought up that way* in the cycle of the system, probably do need it. Some people just can't function out there like the rest of us. Sad truth...|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	I know that with welfare you have to submit so many job applications per week as well as do job training classes just as many hours as you would be working a job if you aren't employed. I am on medicaid and we own our own business, but times are tight right now and although we are making just enough to cover the bills are income is very low. He has to keep the business running (it is paying the bills plus everyone is on a hiring freeze here)and i am 9 months pregnant with a high risk pregnancy and can't work.  This pregnancy was unplanned and i was on birth control, but i couldn't get an abortion.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I think if more people hadnt taken advantage of credit, homes they couldnt afford, birth control they could have taken, many who were hardworking, and lived within their means, wouldnt be in the trouble we are in now.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I don't really believe it, but the media portrays those people as doing such. We do know, somewhere out there, there are a few people who just do not care but really I think people that are getting any type of financial assistance aren't just milking the government. I believe in addition to receiving they may be doing other things that can benefit themselves and their families.

People are like everywhere, some are nice some are not.     I am latin and I can clearly see many cultural differences, and I couldn't say one is better than other, just each one does things their own way.     Not to be mean or rude, but one thing that really susprised me when I lived there is how uniformed are people of the world that surrounds them. The country per se is so big, many people don't think much goes on outside the US. Only a FEW people knew where my country is on a map, and being froma 3rd world country I found that amazing and dissapointing some how.    I was also amazed at how much teens do drugs, and really don't care much about anything. I'm not saying everyone I met was like that, but most people were.

In all honesty, the US is so big and so varied from state to state...no one should put a blanket statement over the whole. Even different regions of the SAME state can be vastly different. Everything from the food, to health care, to how people behave is so different from place to place. For instance, the west coast and the east coast are like night and day! And has anyone been to TEXAS?? Can't be compared to any other state.  I live here now and let me tell you, it is unlike any place I've ever been (and different from county to county). Not necessarily in a bad way, just different. Definitely pro gun where I live...which is new to me.    Hey world, the majority of American PEOPLE are really good people regardless what you think of our politicians or country otherwise
0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Here's the good thing about children: they change their minds often. At seven I wouldn't worry or fret over this too much. Yes, most kids at that age have some dream no matter how unlikely (I wanted to be a tree or a writer at about that age) but it's okay for him not to know. As he grows up he will see that to get the nice things you have to work for them (and hopefully he'll also see that material things don't mean you are successful). Right now he has no real grasp of what successful means, that's what school is for and that's what friends and other family members are for. To encourage his interests and show him opportunities to use those interests to help others and make a living. But, really, let the child be a child for as long as he can, it only lasts so long.|`|9h95rnHPaa	You can't really change who they look up too.

bm1rsts7aa	No that's not weird at all. My best friend's mom is really pretty and stuff and she'll just be like "yeah my mom's really hot." It's not like you're saying you want to go out with her or something. If you and your mom are really close you could be like "wow mom you were so hot!" She'll probably just laugh and take it as a compliment. It's not a big deal though.|`|jP5caZJiaa	TELL HER YOU WANT TO HAVE A 3SOME WITH HER AND YOUR FATHER|`|10mOwk0Taa	That's not weird at all.

Let them know!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I suppose that depends on your definition of hot.    Let her know but use a better word.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	If anything it is bizarre that you would think there was anything wrong with recognizing that your mom was a beautiful woman .Same with the knobs who gave bad comments, you are freaks. My mom was the catch in town in her day and I'm proud of her.|`|nAdCT2lzaa	That's not weird at all...|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	there is nothing wrong with that. As long as your not having sexual feelings about her pic.  (gross)|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	You could say, "hey mom, you were pretty hot back then!" I'm sure she would appreciate the compliment.     My mom was very pretty at that age - she had a lovely figure and was skinny. I found a picture of her one time in a bikini (she was on vacation in Hawaii in 1967) and I was like, "Um, mom, you're kinda spilling out there, aren't you?!" LOL We both had a good laugh about it, at least.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	LoL I saw pictures of my dad when he was a teenager and my best friend grabbed it and said "YOUR DAD WAS HOT!" it's normal. She probably was good looking (and still is) but I know what your saying. The same picture of my dad is on the fridge at my parents house and I told him "dad you were a hottie in high school....what happened"  just kidding around.|`|8Bv8SNSeaa	Thats Normal|`|WHt2NfGaaa	If you were a guy then yes, I'd call you nasty but being that you're a girl it's perfectly natural. As long as you arent a lesbian....? ha
3gDiRoNwaa	Yes my babies did it and my mom always told me the were remembering were they came from that they were reaching out for god and playing with the angels cuz if you pay close attention to your baby the next time he looks up dnt disturb him and watch how he laughs at the ceiling you will think hes crazy but i think it is some truth to what my mother said.|`|a6f6e6d46c68de0747f4aebd1c52f1c6aa	My 4 month old does it all the time.  I call him my statue of liberty....lol|`|2eae4bf1e3779c435068e2d7d68a747faa	My baby loves the lights. When we sit near the windows, he stares outside at the sky (no I do not have him facing the sun) and smiles a lot.  He's only 2 weeks but he lift his arms up a lot when I go by.|`|MthIvBZ3aa	my 6 month old does this alllll the tiiiime!  he did used to stare at the lights a lot but not as much as he used to.  but yeah he's always grabbing and reaching especially for my hair and earrings!
gWlmU1KJaa	He was 240 lbs and 6ft2" tall, and had a big head, had a full beard and drank heavily    I cant wait till he leaves home, he is costing me a fortune    I am beginning to believe the hospital may have swapped my baby for a 40 year old bum|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Aw your son is 4 months and named Ryan has well?  What day was he born?        I have not weighed my baby since around 3 months at the doctor and he was 15.9. 24.5 inches. I imagine he is about 17 lbs a month later.. He was 9 lb 6 oz at birth|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Amber was 17lbs and 26.5 inches at 4 months but I am 5'7 and her dad is 5'11 which I consider to be reasonably tall|`|MthIvBZ3aa	he was 17 pounds 3 ounces and 26 1/2 inches long!  acutally very similar to your little one...and i'm 5'5" and my husband is 6'5" so who knows, that could have something to do with it! but as long as the doc is saying he's fine and healthy, then he's fine and healthy! best wishes...|`|V7Q7SbHfaa	At four months my daughter was 17.2 lbs and 26.5 inches, which are both at the top of the chart.  At her 6 month she was 19.9 lbs and 28.5 inches.  Some babies just grow faster.  Be happy that your baby is big and healthy.  The only thing that sucks is finding them clothes that fit!!!! Lol|`|7WFrijvhaa	my daughter was 14 lbs 12 oz &+ 25 in..@ 4 months  she was 6 lbs 13 oz & 19 in at birth !|`|l0ZuV1yaaa	My first four children at that age were about 13 1/2-14 lb, not as sure about length, but know they were pretty much average.  Your baby's size at 4 months is not necessarily predictive of where he'll end up.  His growth rate may slow down later.|`|ic2B0y7zaa	My daughter is 5 monthss. I took her to the doctor yesterday and she was 14.1 pounds.
yCR6qg0baa	If you use some kind of meds to make you ovulate, your chances are great!|`|Fc5RbhqOaa	As long as you start ovulating, I am assuming that they are going to try using clomid or something to that extent to get your cycles going. I will have to do the same thing. I would think if it his sperm count is high that it might give you a better chance, but a lot of it depends on you too. Check out a product called Pre-seed, it makes your bodies both better prepared for conception, especially making yours less hostile towards your husbands sperm. Good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	There are a few things to consider with the count, the percent morphology, the motility rate, and the number.      Women with PCOS many times have hostile thick CM, I would think that a man with potent sperm would be more successful in fertilizing the egg than other men with less potent sperm.    The catch is there has to be an egg.  PCOS can interfere with ovulation, once you are ovulating then you are good to go.    Babydust
BaFgY7Dcaa	You maybe should go to a fertility doctor if your really concerned.But I bet you'll be fine.
jiFXPCyUaa	i was on paxil with my last pregnancy (which *not due to the meds* ended early) my doctor told me that the risks of any side effects to the baby are lower than you think. and that even though there are side effects, they may not outweigh YOUR health...i was told that it was safe to a point, maybe trying a lower does...now on Celexa and seems to work jsut was well as the paxil did.|`|WJ2cqznbaa	Hi there, sorry to hear about your depression. I was on paxil about 8 years ago for 1-2 years. I would not ever go on it again because the medication didn't let me feel at all. I could hurt a person's feelings without caring. And when trying to get off the medication the side effects were terrible. I would never consume this kind of medication during pregnancy. The baby's health has to come first. In the mean time you need to speak to someone who will listen to you and make you feel better. I know depression is a terrible thing to overcome. You need a good support system right now and I really wish you the best, for you and the precious baby.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	My doctor doesn't prescribe antidepressants for use during pregnancy because they are considered a class C drug.  Paxil is a relatively new drug and has not been tested to be safe for use in pregnancy.  I also have depression and anxiety, but I chose to do prenatal yoga and take lavender baths, etc because they don't pose a risk to my babies.  I would suggest talking with your doctor about healthy alternatives because you don't want to risk causing harm to your baby that will effect him/her for his/her entire life.  Good luck!
wzXJOSIeaa	You did the right thing by telling your mom. And even though she may not realize it now, you could have saved her life. Being a friend is one thing, but being a friend who cares is work! YOU were the one who was the good friend whether she sees that now or not. So don't ever regret that descion.    As far as the party goes. You are being mature about this situation, and if she can't do that, then that's on her back. She should stay for ya'll friend's sake (the one having the party) regardless of what her beef is with you. So YOU stay, because you are not the one with the problem. You shouldn't have to suffer for being a good friend!|`|50azgKE8aa	Ok I was on the exact same situation.  It's hard and frustrrsting when you know someone could really get hurt.  Well I did pretty much the same thing you're doing.  Maybe give it a few more weeks and try to talk to her again.  Or send her an email saying you're always there for her if she ever needs to talk.  That's the most effective things to do.  Just be there if she needs a shoulder to cry on.  And girl go to the sleep over.  If she has a problem with it then she should be the one to leave not you.  Or just keep your distance from her at the party.|`|wUaMEwSsaa	sense u are nicer  u be the one that stays  tell her to get over it|`|CeqbfVscaa	That sounds very mature of u.You deserve to stay though because you don't get wasted but to prevent conflict it would be better if you didn't stay over night.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I would talk to one of your parents about it and see what they think you should do next. Your parents are going to think higher of you for coming to them and shouldn't get mad at you. Tell them you don't know how to work this problem in your life and you really need their help.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	Good decision! You did the right thing in telling your mom and letting her speak to your friends mom. Even though your friend doesnt want to talk to you right now, at least you know she is alive and safe. After all that, I cant believe her mom is letting her spend the night out. I would have her on a leash! Anyway, you should spend the night if you were invited. You should pull other friends into the middle and make them choose. Even though you are being nice about it, you are still having her choose. If she is being immature and will not stay over because of you, then too bad for her. Let her know that you are open to talking if she forgives you and also tell her that you want to be friends again when she is ready. Leave it at that and there is nothing more you can do.Maybe she is afraid you will be mean to her but if you tell her that then she will feel comfortable enough to sleep over too. Good luck!|`|U1ku2k4Naa	I think that is the mature thing to do.  I have a friend, and she is anorexic.  At one point she lied to us, as well as her parents about eating.  She told her parents that her homeroom was ordering pizza, so she didn't bring a lunch.  I found out that they didn't and we got one of our friends to call her parents to tell her.  She never knew it was us.   Trust me, it is for the better.|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	i wouldn't want anything to do with HER if i were  you.    you did the right thing - you saved your  friend... suppose when she was drunk she got  raped or completely disoriented and didn't come  home?    you don't have to change your plans because of  her.    i agree w/ you.  good luck, you're a good friend :)
2TrHH0rkaa	Arabella is a lot prettier and more modern. It also has the cute nickname Bella.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Arabella, it's different.|`|7c2KfY1caa	tanya|`|irGE84Qdaa	to be honest find some more name.i m sorry i don't like any of em,if u want my honest opinion.|`|i4TefIaBaa	tanya, and i don't think it's common, i don't know anyone called tanya, wish i did, it's a lovely name. aww.|`|tj0Vss90aa	Arabella|`|vSISVusvaa	def Arabella. Tanya sounds like an old name. Arabella is a very beautiful name.|`|17acJiqKaa	neither :(  Arabella is a little better, but still to weird for me|`|UGY3i7BWaa	ARABella.|`|c44dIboDaa	arabella..thats such a beautiufl name!!|`|FslUZLsyaa	definitely Arabella!  it's sooo cute!|`|EP0cAEo7aa	Honestly I'm not too fond of any of the names. Sorry.  Though Ariella might be better.|`|SgIr3eWtaa	Arabella    it's a beautiful name|`|fAFJ8sHJaa	ARABELLA!!!!  :)|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	Arabella, definitely. Tanya sounds like an old whore (no offense).|`|oVkeP1lvaa	Arabella?|`|CSzDV3gEaa	arabella. tanya is too common.|`|EvgSMTjnaa	Arabella|`|fZGcufB7aa	I think Arabella is beautiful. I love the name. It's pretty, sweet, & uncommon. Great name!|`|bzkSIJYnaa	I prefer Arabella.|`|CxRJwJsraa	Arabella. It's very pretty and has a princessy feel, but not so cutesy princessy that it annoys me, haha.     Tanya feels dated and a tad vampy.|`|5rqVTOzmaa	Arabella.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	Arabella is SOOOO much prettier then Tanya|`|D2l4sND2aa	Arabella, nick name bella, the ara part is kind of scary like a spider or something if you pronounce it AIRabella. If you pronounce it R-a bella, it's okay|`|7qAlZRHmaa	arabella|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Definitely Arabella.|`|rdGQMSyjaa	I prefer Arabella.
77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	I would handle it by questioning what I had done to instill such fear in my child.    Discipline means to TEACH not to punish.|`|prqrQcd1aa	My daughter is 7 years old and knows full well she is allowed to speak during corner time if she has to use the restroom. But to prevent this we have her use the restroom before she goes to the corner, it prevents her using having to go to the bathroom as an excuse to get out of the corner. She is only in there for a short amount of time anywase.|`|jdRKZe18aa	I would never punish in that particular way myself but if a child did this I would reconsider THAT particular form of punishment wouldn't you?  Instilling FEAR, insecurity, humiliation is HARDLY the purpose of punishment for children in my opinion.  It should be about choice, accountability and age appropriate consequences that TEACH LESSONS.....|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I wouldn't do anything at all, other than clean him up.  He was doing what his parent told him to do.  I would feel extremely guilty.    My son gets 1 minute for each year of his age.    I agree w/ Linda Loo also.|`|AA11327039	I would just clean it up without saying a word.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	they shouldnt be in the coner long enough for that to happen    the corner punishment stops being affective at around 9 so they should only be there for 9 minutes  unless they get off, in which case the 9 minutes is restarted  but i would have explained if they need to go to the toilet they must raise there hand if im in the room or call me once if i am not   and then they will be followed to the bathroom (id wait outside obviously) and then theyd be escorted back to the corner for the remainder of the 9 minutes|`|hKJIDdVqaa	HA-the one who made a child stand in the corner so long he had to resort to pottying in his pants is the one who should be punished.....  Punishment should not exceed the age of your child, one minute per year.  Further more when a child reaches a certain age they should not require corner punishment any longer anyways.  Communication with children is a way to avoid undesirable behaviors and prevent the need to punish|`|3a8d8200494dea80c8e22d328cd4879aaa	How long was he left there?    If your time outs don't generally last longer than 5-10 minutes, it should be pretty rare when that happens. I personally wouldn't tell my kid that he can't talk. I would just ignore him. If he genuinely said he had to use the potty, I would take him there, let him do his business, and put him right back into time out and start the time over again.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I would explain to him if you have to go just let mommy know and you can go but only with permission.Or maybe if he made a sign to you saying  he has to go.Like raiseing his hand or something like that.|`|w0yDXiH9aa	It really depends on the age of the child.  Usually this method doesn't really work at times because the child doesn't understand what he/she did wrong.  In my experiences i usually remove my child from the situation, and sit him somewhere for a minute or i tell him that whenever he is ready to come talk to me he is able to leave his chair. Once he comes to me i explain to him why i was upset and why his actions are not okay.  As parents you want your child to understand why the action is wrong and not just have this fear.|`|R4dcGCVDaa	It would be the parents fault if this happened. One child I read about was in the corner for six hours and this happened.|`|89b9b79c918cf6555bea31d3d7be7d94aa	if you are going to put your child in time out they should be allowed to get up and go to the bathroom. i have a 21 month old daughter and i have started the time out role with her, after i warn her to stop doing what ever she is doing a couple of times i'll tell her to go sit in time out. when we are down stairs she has to sit at the bottom step and if we are upstairs she sits facing the corner in my room. as for the punishment i think its a good one. as for the accidental wetting themselves part, i don't think you should get upset over it, specially if they tried to tell you. my daughter is potty training and does really good but at times tells me a bit too late that she has to go. some parents over react and get upset and yell at their child for this but i think you should be patient with them. now if your child is fully potty trained and you put him/her into time out tell them that they are only allowed to get up to use the potty then they have to return to the corner.|`|iyL6dyMyaa	So what happened when he tried to inform you he had to go?  Did you deny him this obviously so he pottied in his pants?  Anyways I would've only told him to sit there for 3 minutes, and asked him if he had to go to the bathroom before we start the timer.  Common sense.|`|AA11920812	Mine only stay in the corner for one minute of their age. So, my two year old is there for two minutes (unless he acts up and has to restart, but that rarely happens anymore). Even my 19 month old will stay in there with no problems. Obviously, the 19 month old has a diaper.     But, the two year old can hold it. And, has never been in there long enough to do that. If he did I would feel exteremly guilty. I`m sure he would feel embarassed and ashamed to have peed himself even at two. :(((    I saw this question about a 6 year old who stood there for six hours and peed himself. That is terrible!!    In regards to qtpatudy1025  who says a child doesn`t understand the corner punishment and goes un to talk about her method of removing and putting in a chair. WEll, that is the SAME thing as using a corner! Some people don`t use the corner method correctly, but when done correctly that is exactly what you do.    1. Remove from the situation  2. Put in the corner for one minute = to one year of age  3. Afterwards, sit on their level and explain what went wrong and how to fix it  4. Hug and kiss and remind them you love them!
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Aww, that's sweet. You should see us at home though. Or at least me. Right now I'm wearing a sexy ensemble of my husband pajama pants, no makeup, and a baggy t-shirt. Hot stuff I tell ya!     Really though, I think other pregnant women are always gorgeous, it's just hard for me to see that in myself. :]|`|jNqf8HtDaa	all the hormones help us out lol|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well i think it's just you because im pregnant and no where near beautiful but anyway the hair and the skin is thanks to hormones.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	God's way of compensating a woman for her body going to pot.|`|ytE1q20taa	Aww well aren't you lovely?  If a guy round my area commented on how a pregnant woman looked they'd say something really horrible.  You've really put a smile on my face for saying something so lovely :)|`|VUss5AfAaa	hahah thats because theres a glow!  hair grows faster and the skin is glowing.  as for the smile there happy.    its nice to know someone out there thinks of us pregnant women beautiful!! even though we feel like planets ha ha.    38 wks/5days pregnant  due feb 14  its a boy .|`|xeS8pUfbaa	okay you MUST be seeing things. i am 32 weeks pregnant and ever since i became pregnant i started getting ACNE, and my hair has dried up! its horrible, to the point i cant even get my highlights touched up because it will melt off!        i feel really gross looking now that im pregnant!|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Haha, it's called a pregnancy glow. A lot of pregnant women claim they never get it, but I'm pretty sure every pregnant woman gets it at one point, whether or not they actually notice. Trust me, we have our bad days too... :P|`|gyoylefvaa	YES, WE'RE MORE BEAUTIFUL WHEN WE'RE PREGNANT.|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	Aww you just made my day!  :)|`|Jo3Ma2NOaa	you just made feel smile...thanks...im 36 weeks and feel anything but beautiful....youd make a great husband!!!|`|X3zl9hZCaa	ugh u mean the pimples all over my face? my hair is way to thick now and my smile? oh gosh lets not talk about how my gums hurt and bleed every time i brush my teeth!|`|H7hHCHRkaa	Well I have a big belly does that mean I am beautiful!!!!!! Not preganant of course!!! hehe|`|k4x4uSNJaa	the reason is because we don't leave the house half the time because we are hugging the toilet praying to god that we can keep something down the other half!!! lol. and when we do leave its because we have a boost of energy and feel good so we have time to make ourselves look good!!! Sorry if its not your fairy tail answer! its just the truth!!!     but thanks for noticing!!! most people end up saying stuff like wow you look awful today... not many people notice when we look decent!!!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	you may see it this is way: but sometimes its not how we feel. Because we are like double the size/    most likely the pregnant glow - hormones.     god bless x you are sweet.
JnLoHaoAaa	The extra socks would be good and so would the sweater. Don't forget a blanket! You can always take a layer off if you think the baby is overheating but you don't want to go out unprepared|`|JP2h62qiaa	A Onsie and a sleeper with the attached booties is fine. Mittens and a beanie.  Then tuck her up in a blanket. I would drape a blanket over the opening of the infant carrier (if that is what she is in) so she doesn't cold wisps of air on her face or up her blanket.             Everything will be fine. You don't want to over dress her. They sweat easily and can over heat. My pediatrician say's 1 layer more than I would wear. So If I am in a shirt and sweater then I just place a onsie on under his shirt.|`|NpSVEC2naa	its recommended that you dress your baby in one or two more layers than you would wear. make sure you have blankets as well and she should be fine.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	Sounds good, but I would also put a warm blanket over her head to keep the wind out of her face (while you're outside).  If it's really cold, then you could also put a light outfit under the sleeper.|`|MjashZnvaa	That sounds good. Just check her often and make sure shes not sweating, that can make her get cold obviously if shes wet from sweat. And, try to keep any wind or chill off her face.|`|gsQU85fIaa	yes it is ok just keep feeling the baby's tummie if tummie feels too warm then too much clothing|`|pydBwWJuaa	love the name, congrats|`|GybWJQO4aa	its fine what you have. And go ahead and put the socks on. Babies are very sensitive to the cold and also make sure all the clothing underneath is 100% cotton. This makes the baby feel comfortable and not irritated.|`|3gDiRoNwaa	Yes that sounds good and yes you should put on socks anyway and lots of blankets and make sure there is a blanket over her face when you go out.
7SCjPftKaa	Strip down to just your school T-Shirt/blouse and skirt- keep the rest in your bag until you get to the gates. Also, wear a hat!    Tonight, fill a water bottle half full of water and put it in the freezer. In the morning, take it out and fill the rest with just regular cold water so that the ice will thaw more quickly- this way you'll have ice cold water for your journey. You could even bring some ice in a plastic bag to hold or to put against wherever you're feeling really hot.    Make sure you bring deodorant and some wipes so that you can freshen up when you get to school.|`|o0Q7LmMsaa	do you think you can change at school?  because if so why not wear something cooler such as Capri's  and a shirt  then when you get to school go change in the bathroom or locker room or something.  also make sure you carry water.  and try not to make your backpack heavy  instead carry some books in your hands to proportionate the weight of the books.  also keep in mind that a backpack should never be more than 15% of whatever a person weighs    =)|`|Osn1xpu6aa	oh how i wish it was hot and humid right now.    it is 22 degrees over here (fahrenheit)  that's cold.    bring ice water and walk slow and walk in all the shady spots.|`|drI1vsJdaa	bring a bottle of water!|`|sA1ztaEpaa	Take a half frozen water bottle or two. Spray bottle of water and mini-battery-powered-hand-fan.    I'm sorry. :(|`|XLhLC36baa	woww i WISH weather was like that here!! I miss humid and hot weather  But do you HAVE to walk to school? Man thats a lot of walking, i guess theres not much you can do except try to get someone to take you!    Can you take part of your uniform off? i don't know what your uniform is like so you might not be able to.     Hope you don't faint again! lol|`|pqOLekE7aa	Maybe wear lighter clothes then when you get to school change into your uniform, but wear light colored clothing. Take something to drink, try and stay in shade if at all possible? or lol one of those bottle with a fan on them and you can spray your self :).|`|U1ku2k4Naa	First of all, you are very lucky to have warm weather!  Here it is so cold,  -5*C is considered shorts weather.    Anyways, what about bring water?  Or you could also change at school into your uniform, so then you don't have to walk in the hot weather!    xPepper R.|`|IUQZFrMfaa	why are you leaving for  school at 4:00? anyway. UGH I WISH IT WAS HOT HERE! it was 15 degrees fahrenheit here. ugh.ok. um.  if you fainted the last time that could be really dangerous. if you just flat out fainted your head could hit the sidewalk and you could get a concussion. i would talk to your parents about whether its safe for you to be walking to school in those conditions. and maybe ride your bike? it will take less time, you can put your backpack on your bike basket (if you have one), and... wait. actually, if you fainted on a bike that would be REALLY bad. so idk. but bring a huge half-frozen water bottle and a mini fan.|`|NZKiSfVOaa	leave books in school or locker to reduce weight from bag, take and ice pack with you, and take your jumper off.  and drink a lot of water.    Im going to school in horrible cold weather, snow rain and freezing, consider your self lucky!  my hands go purple when there cold!|`|Jucak0HLaa	I wish it was humid and hot here again!What's the temp there?|`|jAURKrKYaa	mini-fan, cold water bottle.  you could walk in lighter clothes then change at school?
Y9t9oJm5aa	Try to talk her out of it. Thats a doozy, I would try my hardest to convince her not too. Good Luck|`|drI1vsJdaa	Talk about STD's and make them as DISGUSTING as you can. Even if you have to make up stories about what happened to people haha.|`|VbUpMxrvaa	Maybe it's just a phase.  Talk to her, but take her seriously so she doesn't feel like she has to rebel & do it just to prove a point.  I agree with what someone else said, talk to her about STDS and how you can actually die from them.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	wow that's really stupid of her. tell her that she's dumb unless you want to see her do it and be a real "slut".|`|2cstdEkIaa	WOWWWWW!!! I ask what other plans does she have?|`|5D1yMIJZaa	you should talk to your daughter don't get to pissed off cuz that will only pusher closer to it|`|dz97Jmnkaa	i wouldnt like it one bit. Knowning that other men would be looking at her naked.   You should TALK to her, and tell her how you feel. Let your inner feelings out as this may open her mind up as to what she's letting herself into.|`|ZXUCxTY8aa	My reaction - upset, disapointed, confused!  My actions - nothing.    As they say: each to their own. Your daughter is over the age of 16, technically she is legal to play A PART in an x-rated movie. People win awards for these things, it may be disgusting and as a Christian X-rated movies are not something I look highly apon, but praise the lord shes not participating int he movie. Then you would have real problems.    You shouldn't be looking through he mail anyway if I can be completly honest. Really, where has the respect for peoples privacy went?|`|RBt0Oz7maa	Well , i would say to support her cos doing something you really want to do without your parents support is really hard. But seein as your her father and shes your daughter I can see how youd be freaked out , If you are strongly against it , try to get her into other things and let her know how you feel , but if shes determined ,just make sure she is safe.|`|epI3b7mHaa	Honestly, I'll say to her, as soon as you turn 18, and get the hell out of my house, do what you want.|`|wqRwSaGSaa	support her.  its good money and its not that bad  its safer than whoring herself around because if shes making the movies with a good company they screen every person to make sure they dont have any std's  its safe.  let her do it if she wants.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	well I would report the place she was working for then tell her that if that is the life that she wants to live to be careful but she couldn't do it while living in my house...|`|dPULl5hjaa	she can't anyway - she's 17    totally disgusting - slut like, STDs, etc.
XpJykT77aa	A duel US/German national should be treaded as German unless the child has a certificate (or is eligible) issued by the US Government stating she is at least 50% American Indian blood.  There for she should live in Germany.  The US is a horrible country to raise children under German standards.|`|DPegPYRPaa	she should go back to the US until the father gets custody rights and then go from there. Basically he kidnapped her. That should not be ok.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	a bit confusing... but i would say that if the girl is a us citizen, the courts in us should decide - not germany. in any event, i believe a child is better off (most of the time) with the mother if one must choose.|`|2xS1Jro7aa	She should go back and live with her mother! That is called kidnapping even though he is her father in the usa he is considered a kidnapper! Who know for sure if he did not force her to say those things by threatening her? Poor little girl needs her mom! Maybe if he wanted to be a good father he could give her back to her mother and ask if he could have her for half the year then she could spend half the year in the usa with her mother and half in german with her father. Some people might be totally against that but it is probably what would make the most sense and what would make the daughter the happiest in the end. Plus she will have an advantage over most she will know 2 different cultures. That is just my opinion though!
syrh8J6Vaa	Scrotus Von Testicleeese sounds good|`|35JIECGRaa	Like someone said before, it looks like Scrotum. Sorry. :(    May I suggest something Seamus? I absolutely adore that name! :)|`|OehjuDxVaa	I wouldn't consider this one.. a different one, sure. No offense but it sounds like scrotum..|`|N4YfKm7qaa	You again?!?! Honestly, have you nothing better to do with your time than waste everyone else's by fabricating these ridiculous names?!?      By the way, why do you keep claiming your names are of Irish origin? Is Ireland really that weird?!?!    Other users - my God, you actually think people in Ireland are called Scrotus?! We speak English in this country, too!!!|`|QdQcAHqaaa	It may be Irish, and it may be traditional, but it is also dangerously close to a certain part of the male body.  I love that you guys are celebrating your heritage, but remember your son is going to go to school, and schoolkids are mean. Furthermore, he might be held back from a job or other opportunities because of his name...so I would reconsider.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	lmbo  i frickin love it, he can be Scrots for short lol|`|J9fxTGwKaa	It sounds latin, but sure!|`|6vdttMYpaa	NOOOO  ha 'scrotum scrotum' in the playground. yikes there must be better gaelic names. or this is just a joke?|`|AA10458195	UH No I don't. How do you think a Grown Man would like it?|`|rev4lrn0aa	No, it reminds me of scrotum.|`|LOwT2RQxaa	its kinda cool sounding.. but it aslo reminds me of "scrotum"...|`|mkT0PQ4Paa	Hmm...I am afraid it screams "scrotum" in my mind, and if that is what it does to tons of other people the child will suffer in school...|`|QH5oOFutaa	No way....it reminds me of scrotum|`|0VFKldieaa	no no no no no come on when you hear the name Scrotus what is the first word that pops into your head?.. SCROTUM. you don't want that name being thrown at your son everyday of his life. stay away from Scrotus.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	horrible. I much prefer the American name "Ballsack"|`|oVkeP1lvaa	Noo..But if u like it ..then go ahead :-)|`|gwindStOaa	sounds like scrotum.... don't do it!|`|viwq8ldvaa	You know what would be even better?   Scrotum !! Very very masculine baby boys name !!  Don't you agree? I'm not sure if it's a Gaelic/Irish name though ... how about Eoghan ... Oisin ... Lorcan .... San .... Eoin?    Classicalmusicalfan - being irish myself, I know and understand how much she pisses you off !!
2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	I started taking my daughter there literally the day she came home from the hospital (she was 2 days old) Obviously she couldn't play with her big brother til she was a little older but it wasn't much longer. They have  an area that is just for the little kids...with toddler size video games, slides etc and it is blocked off from the rest. Plus there are rides that move very very slowly that you can hold them while they ride. My daughter was on those things from the time she could hold her head steady. we actually did her first bday there and she had a blast. So your daughter is definetly big enough! Just make sure you go in the morning during the week. It is a lot less crowded and so it's not so noisy and by the time people are coming in your little one (and you!) will be tired and ready to go! Oh and if you sign up on their website you can get great coupons that are better than the ones from the newspaper. Have fun!|`|DPegPYRPaa	Probably wait a little longer. Maybe 2 1/2.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	My son was 2 when I first took him and he LOVED IT!!|`|44OH7Si6aa	Is she uncomfortable in crowded areas? How does she feel about being around noise?   If you think she is comfortable with it, then by all means take her. Just make sure your first trip is during the daytime in the middle of the week or on an off night, that way you can hopefully get comfortable in the new place without her feeling overwhelmed. You may want to wait on introducing her to the guy in the costume though.|`|OD3hxWxvaa	maybe, don't let her get attatched to it. you know what that'll lead to.    *shudders*|`|ed05090e60ffb81604e4d4052b697bd6aa	I think you should wait. Chuck E Cheese is better for kids who are at least 4 an up.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	since it's not something that's too expensive, I'd take my child there at 18 months. It's a lot of stuff for her to see and take in. Lots of colors and things going on around her. But as for her really understanding it, I'd wait till later on.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I don't know.  I'm sure she'll have fun regardless of where you are.  I think my son, might enjoy it.  although it might overwhelm him.  I know my 3 year old wants to go so bad.  all those dang commercials on nick jr advertising it.  shes even said - mommy its where a kid can be a kid.  i'm a kid.  lol  if you go, you have to tell me what you thought.  i'm still not sure i'm crazy about the idea of going.  too many children running around wild in my mind.|`|VxKlbGtGaa	she would probably have so much fun there my cousin took her friends sister there and she loved it and she is only 18 months old.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I would wait until she is a bit older because they mostly have arcade games there and not a lot for little ones.|`|sqNsOIzkaa	AHH omg I WORK THERE! . Uhm. She might, Chuck E. might scare her or make her really happy. Sometimes it has an adverse affect. But kids love the flashy lights, games, other kids and the Chuck E. Band. We don't have a ball pit anymore because kids abused it. Yea I see most little kids loving it. But you don't need to buy almost any token. She'll have fun moving in the tubes and slide if you like. oh and when you get a prize please don't get anything she can put in her mouth. On second thought she might be too young. but I would bring her and see if she likes. She not you can just go without wasting money. Admission is free =D Food is not so good btw...ahem|`|iDpaNboCaa	I am sick and tired of chuck e cheese.  I have been there for almost all my cousins and 2 of my kids birthday.  I am so over it.  Maybe it just me...  Try to do something else.|`|wUaMEwSsaa	of course she would have fun  it is really fun there for all ages  there is tons of older kids there too|`|9p9DDRSnaa	I was and kinda am still completely freaked out by those large animated machines there and Showbiz pizza place....gives me the heeby jeebies....lol|`|kxIopSI8aa	She will have fun, and you will love seeing her have fun.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	fun is a relative term.  the parents may not enjoy themselves, but the children always do.|`|NroZQN5vaa	I would wait until she's older. There might be too much going on for her there right now.|`|EjfJaNn7aa	maybe...idk giant talking mice kinda scared me when i was little|`|SBJNJEBBaa	i would wait til she is older, chuckie cheese is full of videogames now and really no rides or fun things for little ones, all it is is an arcade now!|`|Q2Sx1Du3aa	Definitely wait..there isn't much a child that young can actually do without getting hurt..|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	Go ahead, they have an area for toddlers. The best part is, she'll be so fascinated by the flashing lights and so forth that you won't even have to spend any money on tokens. Bring antacids (for yourself) and sanitizing hand wipes for all who attend.|`|6Cqj7D8zaa	I'd wait until around 2.  They are more curious and able to more.|`|rMrcsjxpaa	I remember taking children to Chuck E Cheese's and they all enjoyed it. There is a lot to do, from toddler games to a enormous playground for anyone to enjoy! They have exceptionally good food and prizes. You will never know if she will enjoy it unless you tried it out. Have a pleasant day and I hope my answer helped!|`|BsDv3k5iaa	I have been taking my daughter there for a while now!!  If she likes the rides there I think she would have a blast!  My daughter would always run from one to another as soon as it stopped!

AA12029875	I take it, it's your 30 yr old brother you are talking about.  Your mother is enabling adult children to remain children.  All you should do is point that out to her.  You don't have to join in with her in continuing the enabling.  Don't allow them around your house until they become adults.|`|Sl9ybZT7aa	Sit down and talk to your mom and if she don't like move with another family member.|`|fb1K9Jlwaa	Maybe you should learn to have better spelling and grammar before criticizing your brother for smoking a harmless plant.     If your mom gives him some of her money, what business is it of yours?|`|cLgghhuXaa	If they are 30 years old and smoking pot... they do so as an adult who should know better or have decided to do it in spite or laws and consequences...|`|oadMJWOCaa	mm i see|`|lOuiQm4Saa	is this for real? no disrespct. call help (not 911, yet, more like a hotline)|`|AA10213655	personally i think that your mom needs to kick your brother out or even i'm sorry i have to say this and this is only if it really comes to it report him to the police. But i'm sorry this even has happened to you. Your and your family need to have an intervention he is 30 years old and needs to grow up
2owaSpf0aa	Take all 4 names with you, and then when you see your baby for the first time, one will just click into place. I did this with my second son, and I'm doing it with this child. Good luck :)|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I've heard again and again that the name you should go with is the one you immediately think of when you picture your child.  Also, if there is a name you absolutely cannot live without, you should choose that one.      By the way, I love the name Orren on your list, but I'd spell it Orrin.  If you care to, you can google the name Orrin Woodward.  He's an amazing person, in my opinion.  :)|`|0ayP21R9aa	Write down the names on pieces of paper and tape them to yur stomach.Take a piece of paper and keep a tally of how many times a day the baby kicks tht name on yur stimach .do this 4 a month or so and then check the tally,whichever name is kicked the most is the name you choose.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	use my fav or wait till my babi is born|`|eBKJRmEgaa	I would use two middle names, so I'd pick the three names that go together the best.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You and your partner have to agree on them. Keep saying them outloud over and over. Then yell it outloud like you are calling your kid. Also think about your child at age 40 - which name is going to sound good on an adult as well as a little girl?     But you don't have to nail it down in advance. So many parents don't pick a final name until they see the baby - then they know for sure what the name should be.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Scarlett Winter Rose is gorgeous!    Anyways, you could always wait until the baby is born, and see which name suits him/her best, or what name they look like.     good luck :)|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	wait until you see your baby and then choose  a name thats what my husband and i did|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	My mother in law says if you have a couple names you really can't decide between you should just wait until the baby is born and you will know which is the right name when you see him or her.|`|J9fxTGwKaa	I don't know, I would ask my partner and if he couldnt still decide i wouold give it another naem.|`|f6aqMg97aa	I had a few names that I really liked and it was difficult to pick... However, when you hold your baby, & hear him/her breathe you will know the exact names when you have your baby craddled in your arms!    GOOD LUCK!|`|QYDIgOp0aa	Weston Blake Hearn   &   Scarlette Winter :)    BUT they are all beautiful!!|`|d6e11chxaa	I would consider which names have nicknames, and how much I like those nicknames. I would think about the popularity of the names, and the flow. I would try googling the full names, including the last name, and see what pops up. I would think about exclusions that would come with using a certain name. For example, say you love Anna, Emma, and Katherine. If you used Anna, would you still use Emma in the future, or are they too similar to use together? Do you mind the nickname Annie? Try doing all that. Take it to your partner and have him cut one off. If all else fails, get a vote from your family and friends. If you find yourself upset with the vote, you might realise you did have a preference, even if you weren't fully aware of it.|`|35JIECGRaa	Assuming it'd be me and the father that couldn't narrow it down, I would probably go around asking other opinions (like here on yahoo, and my friends an family), or wait until the baby's born and see what name suits him/her.
6yy0jtzDaa	it sounds like the pressure of you cervix is what is making your belly hurt at night and morning and if not it kind sounds like BH contractions which are totally normal after you 5 month the baby hits a growth spurt and starts growing double what its been growing so will prolly be noticing some pounds packing on it sounds like you are fine but if not notify your gyno|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.  They sounds like braxton hicks (tightening). But also contractions - i would go to the hospital to make sure its not preterm labour.    i had similar this morning from 4 am to 8 am.. But they would go away when i stood up or went to the toilet or walked around. Your sounds more painful and reg. Definitely go soon darling,.    god bless x|`|0XXM4U5Zaa	Sounds about right. Growth spurt for the little tadpole. Have you tried changing how you sleep? I found a Snoogle pillow helped a lot when my last one started growing larger.  If you are really concerned about it though, call your Dr. or Midwife. That's what they're there for. And trust me...they've gotten stranger calls in the middle of the night than what you're asking.    Found a pillow like the snoogle at Wal-mart. I am still using mine 4 years after my last pregnancy. I LOVE IT.
UUpsa35Daa	I think if you believe them to be responsible enough then i don't see a problem in it.    My mom started going on week long work conferences (happens once a year) when i was 13 and my sister was 16. She left us alone for that week and we were perfectly fine. No parties; i cleaned everyday, cooked every meal...are homework and grades didn't falter. Things were great.    If you think your kids can handle it then go for it.    If you do go through with it make sure you have a list of the emergency numbers, make sure they can call an adult if needed (a trusted friend, neighbor etc). Have food in the house; if the oldest can cook, great...have ingredients for easy to make meals - if he can't cook then you could get mac and cheese, frozen pizza, anything where it doesn't take a ton of cooking ability. And there's always the option to order out i suppose. Also, make sure to set some rules -- i'm pretty sure you will but just putting that out there.    Trust them and believe in them to do a good job and follow the rules. They most likely will. Give them that chance, you can always call to check in every so often.|`|qN5iVvAFaa	honestly i think it is a great idea... its also  a great form of birthcontrol. she will understand how much work it is, and make her want to wait to have kids...|`|CRHBC9gIaa	well im a 14 year old girl too, and if my mom left me at home with kids and my 17 year old brother, i would be mad, unless she paid me for bbysitting. and if she didnt pay me i wouldnt be home except for at night. after school i would go to a friends house. so but thats just me.|`|P544Sbmqaa	One word...  PARTY!!!!    Just kidding.  If you think the older two are mature enough to handle EVERYTHING for 3 days, then maybe.  But I would be leery.  For one, I know as a 17 year old the LAST thing I would want is to be stuck at home for 3 days with the kids.  Next, thats a lot for a 17 year old to handle if they arent used to doing this already.    If do, I would suggest having an adult that they could be in touch with in case something comes up and so they could check on the kids.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	My stepdaughter and stepson were left alone for a week (the grandparents live in the basement apartment so they weren't totally alone) when they were 15 and 13 and they are good kids.  The 15 year old stepdaughter ended up inviting a boy over for the week and nobody noticed for days!!!!    My theory is that you take a risk by doing it, even with good responsible kids, it's simply too tempting.    Now the stepson lives with us and he is 18 years old.  We let him spend the weekend at home alone not too long ago for the first time ever and we had at least three adults who were going to stop by at random times to check and make sure he was behaving, and he knew this.  As far as I know, he behaved and nothing bad happened, but it was sort of nerve racking!    I couldn't imagine leaving him for several days and putting him in charge of his siblings too....they are 10 and 8 years old.  It's simply too much and I would worry the entire time.|`|qTIWITsNaa	Unless you had this spark in your mind you would have left them together.    But anyway this though has come in your mind. So better dont leave them together.    I have 2 reasons to say this....    First, You will feel restless when you travel and while staying in your Georgia thinking of this.    Second, If Jack is still kiddish, You wont even think like this. You feel internally that he is matured.    So just take emma or jack with you when you travel. Hope it helps.|`|OMyC0IJVaa	Have they ever watched them long term or over night before? 3 days can be forever if things are not going well. Also you had better designate who does what before going. Personally I probably would not but I am a worry wart. Maybe leave the 3 older ones home and take the 4 yr olds with you, they can stay with your sister while you visit your friends. Or you could just wait and do it another weekend when your husband will be home and you can have more fun with no worries.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Weather she wants the responsability or not is not a concern.  If given the responability by her parents your teen should accept it...you are the parents.  I would do it if these teens are mature enough to handle the responsability....and mature enough to be responsible doing somehting they have been told to do even though they don't want to.  If the neighbor will also be home at the times the teens are caring for the younger ones and can ensure that she is a good backup for them and the houses are nice and close and not seperated far away like country homes then I'd say do it...otherwise don't if you don't have propper backup for them and feel comfortable that they'll do what they are expected to do.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	No way you are insane I wouldn't leave my kids alone for all the gold in the world they can all get killed or something the 17 and 14 are too young for that kind of responsibility and four year old twins not even the 10 year old. you better get your priorities straight your kids come first. have your friends cared enough to come see you in you in the past three years? why should you leave YOUR CHILDREN at home alone! you are not a teenager without worries you are a mother times 5!!! and now you are taking on more responsibilities with your niece maybe you should take that time to prepare yourself for another child in your home. don'tn't want to be rude just realistic. think about what you are doing your children should come first... God forbid something should happen to them when you are gone you will never forgive yourself and you better believe that your friends will not be able to bring them back! not to mention that DCF frowns upon parents leaving there children alone without adult supervision! maybe there is a reason for this?|`|PoHpSqwwaa	Yeah , They're old enough. Think of it as a responsibility test =)
wzXJOSIeaa	You still might be pregnant. You HCG levels might not be quite high enough just yet to show up as a +. Some woman have to wait about a week or two after a missed period to get a + test result. Call the doctor and get a blood test done or just wait and see. Either way would be fine.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Possibly too early - wait another few day to a week and test again|`|hoX7hoINaa	Wait a few days and test again. Good chances due to the brown discharge not being followed by a period. Clear Blue Easy Digital was the one I liked :)|`|soFpywFcaa	i think you should wait to see if your period is late and re test it just might be to early|`|b2TDw4VIaa	i am about 5 months along now and when I had my first missed period i went through the same wiping with brown discharge. The first test i took was negative and when i still had not started three days later the next HPT i took was positive. The brown discharge could be from implantation. good luck!|`|2ObqoJbKaa	It might just be your period being irregular, or you could possibly be pregnant, and you maybe you tested too early. I would wait another week or so and take another test. good luck.|`|S5v9I0y2aa	You could still be pregnant, just not showing the required amounts of HCG hormone for a positive test.  Wait a few days and test again.  Your symptoms do sound like pregnancy symptoms!    All the best|`|7yd7lNU7aa	Too early. Wait a week and test again. Still too early? Do it again in a week. Still no period and feel the same if not worse. see the Dr. You could be pregnant but the hcg is too low to detect from a urine test.|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	Your body may not be creating enough HCG hormone for the test to pick it up. I would wait about a week and take another one.
6igjX2cnaa	I tried Clomid from my RE this past Nov. 08.  I was on 50mg and that didn't work for me cuz it worked tooooo well.  It gave me too many follicles and thinned out my uterine lining.  I also had some hotflashes with it.  The Ovidrel shot, I've had twice, that one time in Nov after the clomid and recently.  Ovidrel gave me sore breasts.  I actually still have them from when I got the shot 13 days ago.  I just got my BFP today, so the Ovidrel definitely helped me ovulate to get pregnant :)  I was on a cycle of Femara + gonal-f + ovidrel + timed intercourse.  If you have a symptom on it (cloimd/ or ovidrel) that you find weird just give your dr. a call.  Best wishes hun!!! :)|`|eemmWU0Haa	My twin sister tried clomid and she was always sick and her breast hurt 24-7 and she didn't like the what it did to her  so she stopped taking it|`|4I7DQWP3aa	Well the only side effects I have on clomid is dryness and hot flashes. Don't know what ovidrel is, sorry.|`|j9axB0YMaa	First I should start by saying I'm sensitive to medication. I've only taken the clomid and side effects where...  Hot flashes, I could feel them coming on like a wave and I would sweat bad.  Swollen fingers, I would recommend taking off your rings the first day just in case.  Vision problems, things would have tracers like I took a hit of acid. It was worse at the end of the day when my eyes where tired.  Cramping and stabbing pains in my lower abdomen, my Dr. said it was because your ovaries can become enlarged.  Mood Swings. One day I felt so depressed I remember thinking people that commit suicide must feel this way.  Nipple soreness  I did this for 4 months with no sucess. I hate clomid.|`|HCmAoNjzaa	Hot flashes & mood swings. I just finished my 4th round of Clomid and so far I'm not a fan but IF i get a BFP I'm sure i'll think it was all worth it.|`|7iMZ91K7aa	My side effects have been neusea, hot flashes, and basically any kind of pregnancy symptom...
7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	It just means that she learns differently than the other students. It doesn't even necessarily mean she learns more slowly. Sometimes teachers need to put students in extra classes because they need a teacher who specializes in a different way of learning. She might not need to be "held back" if she gets the learning aid she needs now. She can still continue to go to different grade levels and have very high self esteem. In order to higher her self esteem, get her involved in things that she has fun doing and things she is good at. Praise her when she accomplishes a difficult task. Let her help out when she can and praise the things she does to help. Let her know you appreciate her helping you with daily activities and chores.|`|AA10478146	In order for her to be diagnosed with a LD the school had to conduct a battery of tests and there has to be a discrepancy between her IQ and achievement.  If they do in fact discover a LD, the school must (by law) provided accommodations and/or modifications to help her be successful in school at each grade level.
EanVzQBQaa	I think you did the right thing at school.  You don't want to flat out reject her.  That could ruin your friendship.  I would talk to her in privite about what your unsure about.  Or give it a try and maybe she'll see your better as friends.  But this is a tough situation   I agree.|`|7UIoQFKJaa	tell her the truth, dont care about what other ppl say or thinks about u, cuz they all do tht when a guy say no to a girl or a girl say no to a guy.|`|EXhVHMAlaa	If you don't like her, then don't be with her.  It's simple.  By saying no to her you might hurt her now, but it'll be better in the long run.  Good luck.  God bless.|`|XElaAuHHaa	Try to let her down gently, explain to her you just dont see her in that way (although she is lovely etc etc - girls have hearts that easily break :) ) you value her friendship and want to continue to be friends, but for you that is all it can ever be.    If she doesn't accept it you have to say that your sorry, but you cant be any thing more than friends..    Not quite sure what else to say to you, but i think this should do the trick - just dont do it in front of anyone!|`|tu7aqUoxaa	let her know what you are looking for in a female and you have not found that in her|`|U1ku2k4Naa	I think you should be honest with her.  Take her to the side, and let her know that you don't like her in that sense.  If she is a good friend she should understand, and shouldn't be mad at you.    You also shouldn't care what others think or call you.  There is no point in lying with yourself, and setting up an empty relationship just to please your friend, and to make the name calling would stop.  That would make you seem very selfish, and you can hurt your friend's feelings.    xPepper R.|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	i think you should tell her when  you're alone or over the phone (not  with tons of people around or in a text).    put it nicely.  just say 'even though i'm single, i think  i'd rather just be friends with you. we've been  friends for a long time and i want to keep it  that way.'    it might be rrrrrrreally awkward after that,  but it's none of anyone elses business.|`|XX0RUwQYaa	I would just tell her that you see her as a friend and nothing more. Just be honest with her because if you don't then you will end up hurting her more! So just be honest, it will end up being better that way so you don't feel pressured to like someone that you only see as a friend.Just make sure that you are talking alone with her! I had a good friend that liked me a while ago but we grew up together and I didn't like him like that because I see him more as my brother. You know when you grow up with someone and as you get older either one of the friends start to like each other? Its hard to explain but you would know what I mean because you are going through it right now with your friend. Anyways just be honest and hopefully it will make the problem seem better! Good luck I Hope I helped! =]|`|cIPziIdnaa	I think you gotta be honest with her "hey I really like you but I jus want us to be good friends" but one on one in private; you did the right thing by not embarrassing her in front of her friends at school - i think you will have girls throwing themselves at you for a long time dude - this is really a "good problem" to have, lol!!|`|Wc3Vge9taa	well if you have been friends with her since you guy have been in the 5th grade then just tell her how you really feel bout her she will understand. If that doesnt work then tell her you see her like a little sister since you guys have been friends for so long. goodluck|`|dPULl5hjaa	flat out just tell her NO - not man enough?|`|yFYFSjwcaa	Just tell her how you feel its better you tell her now if shes a good then shell understand.|`|z3Oed98laa	do wat ur heart tells u and if u dont like this girl than just say no. If she really is ur friend she will accept this...but its not fair for her or other people to force you to date her|`|emkT1a6raa	Do what you want to do  not what others want you to  don't go out w/ someone because it'll make you "cool"  do it because you want to and truly like them|`|KwJDWvB3aa	uhhh shes a *****....tell her you dont like her that way.
UrZ8SFpqaa	"Mommy of 5" sounds like a stuck up snob. I know many kids who got B's in school and are very successful in life, what a snot head.     Anyways, I would've done the same thing. If he continues on with it, get the principal involved. We had kids like that in my school when I was still in high school, but eventually they were just so ignored to death that they dropped out.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Well, I think it's best to avoid pushing and fighting when possible, but I also realise that sometimes people just can't take it anymore and they snap! Which is obviously what happened to you... its human, just dont make a habit of it.    I'd say that kid needed someone to put him in his place, but if he keeps being annoying, don't push him again.. just realise that he is trying to make himself feel better because he knows everyone thinks hes annoying and he just wants to make YOU feel like the loser.    And I don't think straight B's are bad, by the way. As long as you work hard.|`|CRHBC9gIaa	u did the right thing and if he messes with you somemore, push him again or have some of the older kids that know you do something about it.|`|FcXRv4Vaaa	Probably not, but it's not the worse thing in the world.  I mean, you pushed him after he bullied you. My friends and I push each other all the time and never get in trouble.    A little trouble every now and then isn't to bad anyway.    I don't think you should worry.  =)|`|ewQDWKp0aa	JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE YOU COULD GET IN BIG BIG BIG TROUBLE BY YOUR PARENTS AND TEACHERS OR SOMEONE ELSE SO DON'T DO IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|oHO0XOQVaa	You have a lot of self control, what a d*ck. He's seriously probably jealous in a way and doesn't even realize it. He's a jerk and everyone doesn't like him and you have a lot more friends than him.   Good for you, he needs to get put in his damn place.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	"Straight B student" hahaha....that gets you far in life.     Yeahhh...i think that i probably would of pushed him too, see how that went but don't start pushing him because it will come back on you. Just ignore him, he wants a reaction.|`|vBahPYJGaa	violence is never the answer but in your case you have every right because that boy sounds like a big nerd that likes to start stuff.|`|K24QQ2mlaa	i would of done the same thing too.   if he want respect from me then he better show respect too..|`|tkkYIdIvaa	There's got to be a stop to that kind of stuff. Not necessarily the best idea though. Pushing into a trash can would be last on my list of solutions.|`|VvvDGgJXaa	you sould have punched him if he really pisses off every one|`|ZbTeOwuTaa	I can understand the urge and I can't say I would have done any different than you did, but retaliating really does just bring you down to his level.  Violence of any kind is never the answer, two wrongs don't make a right, and all of those cliches are cliches for a reason, and that reason is, they're true.    As much as it sucks, ignore him and let it roll off your back.  He'll mature or at least everyone else will mature and he'll be intimidated into stopping.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	i probably would have done the same thing but don't let him get to you and get you in trouble really he isn't that important as for you to mess up because of him.  remember the only way some people have of making themselves feel good is by putting other ones down because the don't think much of themselves.  besides who wants to hang around that jerk anyways.  You must be real important to him if he is always all up in your business.|`|mppKv11Eaa	Yeah. Sometimes bitches like him (and yes, I'm saying he's a *****, because women who act that way are classified as a *****, no? Why should it be gender specific?) need to be knocked down a few pegs.    I remember I was in, oh....hey...7th grade! wow...anyways. There was this girl who always picked on me, everyday, all the time. She called me stupid and ugly ( which, btw, I am quite above normal intelligence, and I most certainly am not too shabby looking) Well one day, I was fed up with it and beat her to a pulp. she left me a lone after that. c:    And don't tell me that I Should've reported her to teachers and what not, because i had. Many times. It didn't work.|`|fQ9MPAUpaa	i know i'm going to get thumbs down, but two wrongs don't make a right. that sounds like something i'd THINK of doing.... but i have enough self-controll.....
aCUHzMrmaa	Probably cause shes feels like shes at a strangers house.  Why cant she sleep at her own parents house?  Mine only cried cause they had a bad dream or wtvr but i was there to comfort them not my fiance's parents lol.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Numerous reasons for this. The most common one is scary dreams.  But could be anything form molesting to feeling they live in unstable home life.  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|i7oGjwJBaa	my daughter never cried without waking up from a dream, but i do suspect my son is not awake sometimes when he cries at  night.  i think, though, that it's really sort of an inbetween stage.. and he's crying because he doesn't want to wake up.|`|U9pnPXnpaa	My kids do that.  They also talk, mumble, sleep walk, yell, etc.|`|sLLgERQWaa	The child needs counseling...she's having serious issues with her father's re-marriage, she somehow sees it as an abandonment of her deceased mother and it might be fueling bad dreams....she needs to be shown exactly what a sacrifice her Dad has made in her interests, how his remarriage is in no way disrespectful to the memory of her mother, and that he did the very best he could for her....placing her with his parents where she could be cared for 24-7 in a loving, stable home....as a single parent in the armed services, what else could he have done with a orphaned newborn daughter?    Get her into counseling, first her, then the rest of the family.

AQ5JzkzZaa	well lets look at the positives and negatives..  move: fun and cheap, but what if people dont like the movie, and your sitting there for like two hours without moving. ((i cant sit still that long))  pool: its fun and everyone likes to swim, although what about those people who dont like to be seen in a bathing suit, they end up sitting on the edge all by themselves.  mini golf: fun and competitive, but what if someone gets a little too competitive, or doesnt like golf?    thats my advise, i dont know your friends so just observe what kind of people they are so your party wont be completely lame.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	POOL|`|KdCzS5Q4aa	Pool!

Movie can get boring (god forbid you pick a movie that isn't as good as it looked, or that didnt fit everyone's taste in movies.. I.E. one friend likes adventure another likes horror)    Mini golf may be boring to some friends, sounds fun to me.. But you dont want to bore your party mates.    In the end, its up to you. Its your party, after all.    Good luck.  =]|`|JpmKtpqmaa	A pool party is very nice!!!!|`|tu7aqUoxaa	have a pool party|`|lSl2Arlpaa	pool!    sounds fun :D|`|NzcQ1Skjaa	Pool I think is the best one.|`|IKxcvkbUaa	a sexxxxi party|`|SzpJGa9Uaa	I would say pool party bc I always have a better time at pool parties.|`|Lyrc2BWmaa	all those are lame.    you should have a weed party wooh.|`|169ukxC4aa	dont have a party just hank out at ur own place and any way ....April is so far away (2 months) =)|`|h9AAUU4kaa	Pool!!!

AA10391626	I would try it out now. If she's doing well with stage 2 try stage 3. My son is 9 months old and he's on stage 3. The fruits and veggies aren't much thicker really, but the dinners are pretty chunky. You need to stay with stage 2 meats cuz they dont have them in 3 for some reason.

God bless x all the best for her|`|UwIpnN2Iaa	Sounds possible.|`|Uiew8yuCaa	Pregnancy tests are cheap and easily accessible at a pharmacy or convienience store. Go get her one tell her to read and follow the directions. Best to know early.|`|rctDnhO1aa	she probably is when you are first pregnant some woman bleed a little but it's just the last of your period blood leaving you, and if she was on birth control and ran out she should have been smart enough to refill it, you can get it free or really cheap at planned parenthood plus they give you like 3 morning after pills
ZbnxGIsnaa	Hahahaha!!!! This is becoming fun with this adding to stuff!    I have actually seen this video before and it made me giggle!!!!  Still makes me giggle.  Thanks for the video!    You'll get to experience that soon dear.  =)|`|7iMZ91K7aa	haha I love that video!! I also love how I've started a chain reaction to cute videos on here!! Come on girls, if you have any videos BRING EM ON!! lol|`|JnLoHaoAaa	It's definately a cool experience, but made me squirm a little.

10mOwk0Taa	Yea, you are very lucky and had every right to say those things to them.  We have to pay $10,000 just to be healthy during prenatal care and to have the baby.  Forget about once it gets here!  That's easily another $5k a year.  Plus, if we want our kids to go to school without oweing a bunch of money to the government then we have to save at least $24,000 for them for college.  Seriously?!  They need to realize  how good they've got it.  Sheesh, wish I could be a citizen of your country!|`|lr9E8IC5aa	Where is "here"?     Good for your government to step up and take care of it's citizens. It cost me approximately $10,000 USD just to give birth to EACH of my kids. I can't even tell you how much I've spend on diapers, formula etc.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	so what's the incentive to have legitimate children?|`|E5CnUdhsaa	here in th uk its the same. and i think there whingers ....most of them are on benefits so i cant say im surprised. i personally would of told them to go and get a job if they felt they werent getting enough from the government but thats IMO|`|HqSsNmeUaa	So how much of your income do you actually get to keep?  The U.S. isn't socialized, yet, if Obama has his way it will be very soon.  We pay for our own health care, my husbands health care through his employee pays for all of our medical expenses for having a child.  It shouldn't be the governments job to pay for people to have children.  They are involved enough in our lives and I really don't understand why so many people think they can just sit on their *** while government takes money from those who Do work to pay for their laziness!  Honestly, where do you think that money comes from??? TAX PAYERS!|`|QMlWKN6maa	I live in the US.    I pay for every medical/hospital bill. I paid over 15,000 to give birth to each of my children. Who knows how much I have spent on diapers, check ups, & so on. I paid over $23,000 a year for 5 years (so far) at a private university.    I love life in the US though, and I wouldn't give up my citizenship for everything free.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Not to be mean, but the spelling that's being shown here doesn't exactly tell me the schools and universities where you are at are so great.    Your medical care isn't free.  It's taxpayer funded.  As for having a baby and whatnot, why not pay for it?  I think people who choose to get pregnant should pay for it.    Edit: Disagree all you want, but when people choose something, they should pay for it themselves.  Otherwise don't get pregnant if you can't handle it.    I'd rather pay for my own healthcare, and I do.  I pay my own way.  I don't expect taxpayers to do it.  I get to choose what doctors I see.  I get to choose any treatments and whatnot.  I believe paying for your own healthcare as much as possible is much better due to you have many more choices.|`|hJoB7VR1aa	I wish we had your system in the US. I had insurance with my daughter and her still cost about $1,200. If I decide to send her to preschool it will be $150 a month. A the current public college rate her total tuition for BA will run about $20,000.|`|7SCjPftKaa	You get paid to go to college but certainly not university! It's a very costly business.    And no, you weren't out of line.|`|3gXQPso5aa	yes. i live in VA and kids are expensive and we do not get paid to go to collage|`|UYfqzCoMaa	You were absolutely not out of line for what you said. You are one of the rare people in this world that is grateful for what they have not complain about what they don't have. It's an amazing attitude to have and don't let people like them bring you down.

mRnTvuOPaa	My dad was very strict growing up. I couldn't even go to friends houses to work on school projects. I always hated it and wished he was more like some of my friends parents that let them do whatever they wanted to. As I grew up I realized, as ridiculous as he was at times, his way was better than letting me do whatever I wanted. My friends whose parents let them do anything got pregnant, had abortions, always doing drugs, rapes, etc. I'm not even exaggerating. I know there are people that are smarter than my friends and wouldn't have ended up in such bad situations (I had really stupid friends) but I do think if I were to talk to them today they would tell me that I was lucky to have my dad.|`|mppKv11Eaa	Well, I can tell you right now. My mother raised me, I think, fairly well.    She'd let me do what I wanted to do and to express my individuality, but it's not that she didn't care. On the contrary, she cared very much about what I did and how I did it. It's a reverse psychology type of thing. She didn't restrict me as much, and as a result of that, I didn't feel the need to rebel. When parents lay too many rules on their teenagers, they are suppressing that person, creating a great deal of stress. The only way they can relieve that stress is by rebelling against the parent.    A good example is my boyfriend. His mother is a CONTROL FREAK, so by nature, she is going to want to know where he is, what he's doing, why, when, who with and such. Now this is normal for things like, parties and hanging out with his friends, but for EVERYTHING? I think not. There is a reason she's been divorced twice :D    It also takes a great deal of the child/teen's participation, too. To already have information like the who, what, where and why, and telling them without them asking, shows parents that you can be responsible....unless it's to an irresponsible place. and if you lie to your parents about such things (unless your parents are control freaks and want to keep you cooped up in the house for eternity: see "The fall of the house of Usher" by Edgar Allen Poe), then shame on you. They have a right to keep inside, seeing as how irresponsible it is that you lie to them about it (even so, if you have to lie, just don't go to it).|`|hiSa7qthaa	My mother cares about me, but she trusts me to use good judgment in the things I do. Let me explain some things. I have a crack head for a father. I see him and know I don't want to be like that, so I stay away from the heavy drugs, I do smoke pot here and there. Three of my four uncles are alcoholics, I see them and know I don't' want to end up like them, but I do drink. I see what's going on around me and know I didn't want to end up like that. In a way, it's a good thing to be brought up in a dis-functional family, because you see it first hand. Whereas somebody who has never experienced any of those things can't really explain it to their kids about what it can do, all they know is what they read or was on TV. Most of the people I know that are into the heavy drugs and heavy drinking had parents who were the goody goodies, and never experienced those things first hand.    To sum it all up, my mother raised me to use my head. She cares very much about me, and she trusts me to make the right decision in those kinds of situations.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Honestly, neither extreme is good.  I lived under the over protective parent, and my cousin lived under the completly lax parent.  Neither out come was ideal.  The best way to parent is middle of the road.  Protect your kids, but give them room to make mistakes while you are still able to guide their behavior and help them fix their mistakes.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i would rather have a over protective parent?|`|mkrKHQvFaa	I think every kid dreams of doing what ever they want.  I grew up with a friend that got everything she wanted and did what ever she wanted.  Well she grew up to be a total druggie.  She did not get the love and guideance that she needed.  In the long run those rules are life lessons.  And if you are raise with no rule well....your life will end up that way.  I would rather have guideance and love.  I am glad I had that.
be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	Most of the time the cause is not known, unfortunately. I had one in June ans they even tested the fetal tissue ans still had no reason!    Some things to do to ensure you are doing everything you can to be healthy for your baby (there really is no way to prevent a miscarriage):    -Don't drink, smoke or do drugs.    -Take your prenatal vitamin.    -Eat a well balanced diet rich in whole foods and low in processed foods.    -Drink plenty of water    -Don't lift anything extremely heavy. (I was lifting my toddler several times a day and carrying him around with me, my placenta tore partially away from uterus. I can't say for sure that the lifting caused the tear BUT after learning about the tear the doctor said no more lifting. So just in case, try not to lift anything heavy if you don't have to!)    Good Luck!|`|qWF36Ujaaa	you can get a miscarriage when its your first baby|`|eV7rtxmuaa	I had a miscarriage last month and was told most people miscarry due to the baby having something wrong with the genetics & its natures way of getting rid of it. Another major thing that causes miscarriages is stress.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Its usually caused because something is wrong with the genetic makeup of the baby. Its not anyone's fault, it just happens. My doctor told me there's nothing you can do to prevent it. If its gonna happen, its gonna happen.|`|mQhSxCpoaa	A lot of the time a spontaneous abortion (a.k.a. a miscarriage) will happen because it is a woman's body of knowing that the baby inside of her does not have a chance to survive outside of the womb. Usually it has to do with an underdevelopment of organs, or a problem with the genetics of the child.   Although, besides genetic things that are beyond your control you can control the environment of your child from the outside.   Don't smoke, drink, do drugs, try to stay away from stressful situations, extensive lifting, be careful when using cleaning products, cleaning out the cat box, stay away from radiation, and eat well.   Just some advice. Good luck!|`|21b47d122a6ec6e838e9961dbe9fc42caa	Stress. Try to avoid stress-full situations|`|7yd7lNU7aa	Just try to take real good care of yourself. Most miscarriages are not the carrying mothers fault. It is nature's way of selecting a healthy pregnancy and baby. A lot of the time it is out of our control!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	The main reason (as in 95%+) that women miscarry has to do with genetics. There are usually chromosomal problems and the fetus aborts it itself.
cn2rvsdOaa	No sorry!|`|7vk4xoKZaa	Dontay is a very cute name!   Kodey for a girl is cute.. I also like Stevie for a girl or Alex.|`|Q9MBZZMcaa	i personally dont like any of those names|`|6SB4ufEYaa	Why spell it like that???    DO YOU WANT YOUR CHILD TO GET BULLIED???

Cody is okay. Not great.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	No...sorry. I like Dante and Cody though.

Don't use weird spellings, I doubt your child will thank you for spelling their name Dontay. Out of these names, I would choose Cody.

Your kid won't get the **** ripped out of them for it.    Kodey...i'd spell it with a 'c'. Just imagine your poor child having to go through the embarrassment of spelling their first name over the phone again and again and again.|`|gdnL63ngaa	Yeah Dontay looks like Donkey. I like the spelling Dante for "Dontay"    Kodey? I don't like the "e" in there but it looks like a boy name.|`|8h2P3Gyyaa	i don't like the girl not sorry. If i have a girl i was thinking about naming her Temari. I do like Harvey by the way. Dontay not so much b/c of they way it is spelled. if you choose that name spell it Donate.|`|FtVfuByHaa	Harvey is good, the others not so good|`|AA10643913	Please remember that names like 'Dontay' and Kodey' might mean something to a few people today but in the future wont. Better stick to 'time served' names than ones which your child will not thank you for in years to come. I was given 2 'silly names' which I dumped very soon.
AA10391626	This happened to me as well and what you need to do is massage it out with two fingers and put a warm pack on it and also just keep nursing. That's all you can really do and eventually it will go away. Usually the result of that happening is an improper latch so make sure hes all the way on the nipple and the aereola area.

They'll probably ask you questions like "Why do you want to work for us?" and if its your dream job then you should be fine in answering it.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Be ambious and make sure the employer knows that this is your dream job. Make a few jokes to lighten the mood.|`|6lSbmXunaa	Hey I've seen you on Y!A before!    Okay, relax and go in with a smile and a good mood.  This is an amusement park, not a business job so you don't have to be too formal- but you want to let them know that you'll take your job seriously.  They should ask you some easy questions so just answer them to the best of your ability and BAM you've got yourself a job!  Good luck!

8e5bIYjJaa	It can change daily depending on whether I head out or whether I am at home!    General day with my 6 month old is -     Conner wakes up at 6.00 for some milk, has a quick little nap again and then at 7.00am goes in his play pen for a little while whilst I have breakfast and a much needed cup of tea.    At 7.30am we head out for a walk, get back around 8.30am. He then has his 'big boy' solids and some more milk and goes down for a sleep at 9.30am for about 2 hours.    During this time I have a shower and do chores around the house, when he wakes up (around 11 -11.30am) we play and mess around for an hour, then he has some "big boy' solids for lunch and some more milk.    At about 1.00pm, he then goes back in his play pen an amuses himself whilst I have some lunch. Usually then watch a bit of t.v and he has a little nap (bout 30mins). I do a bit more housework (yay).     At 3.00 he starts to get cranky every day, so I spend about an hour keeping him entertained and soothing him. At 3.30pm he has some more milk, then at 4.30pm he watches some cartoons whilst I am preparing for dinner.     At 5.00pm he has his big boy solids for dinner, at 5.30 he has his bath (which is when my partner usually gets home and takes over). I start dinner whilst my partner plays with him, at 6.30 we eat (or try to eat....hahaha). Conner then gets some more attention from us both, some more milk before bedtime, at then goes down to sleep around 8.30pm.    That's when I do the same as you - time with hubby, dishes and quick clean.    Phew - what a day!    EDIT - I was just reading my answer and thinking that it sounds too easy! It's really not that simple (i'm sure you know how it can go), like yesterday, Conner spent most of the day wanting to be held and crying if he was put down...so I was on the couch in front of the t.v. most of the day....or today...where I am on yahoo answers instead of cleaning.....woops....lol!|`|vsFJZRkGaa	my son is 4mths (i hope its still okay for me to answer!)  our day:  i change his nappy whenever he needs it, normally once every 2 hrs.  7.30am - bub wakes up normally laughing or squealing, and this wakes me up.  i feed him.  i change his clothes  i play with him in the lounge room OR take him for a walk in his pram (depends on my energy levels lol)  9am - bub and i go play with daddy in bed.   i have breakfast.  i do some housework  12noon- i feed bub  go on an outing   3pm - feed bub  4pm - play/naptime  5pm - play outside  6pm - bathtime, change into pjs, feed bub, have long cuddles in peace and quiet  7pm - bub puts himself to sleep in his cot  (then he sleeps through till the morning.)  8pm - i do all the housework i didn't get done during the day   9pm - daddy comes home from work and we catch up on the day before bed.
Jucak0HLaa	Umm I'd just take it to the store where you got it at.You could mess it up worse,and they will most likely be able to fix it.This is what i'd do.

PqA5hCfbaa	I am in the same exact position as you! I heard it can happen... well, it just happened to my friend last week! lol. She went in on Tuesday and she wasn't dilated. She started having contraction on Wednesday and had the baby. It is possible i guess.|`|I7myOp8Qaa	I am learning that with pregnancy anything is possible.....I am going to be induced on the 10th and I haven't had a pelvic exam yet but I doubt I am anywhere close to being dilated.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Anything could happen when it comes to pregnancy. I know that I went to the doctor at 39 weeks and when she felt my cervix she said it would probably be another two weeks. Then I went into labor a couple days later. Some woman (like me) it happens quickly, others do take a while. So yes, it is possible.
AA11763588	Yep, that's a positive.    You need to find an OBGYN if you don't already have one.    They will want you to come in and do another urine test and once they confirm you are, then they will set you up with your 1st appointment.    Congrats!|`|26A1Q3eqaa	you might be very early call a dr and schedule an appt|`|0Id85yiYaa	yep, it's positive.    congrats!|`|nI2O1rJUaa	You might just be in the early stages. I found out I was pregnant early and the line was faint. Start taking folic acid and book a midwifes appointment at the hospital. Good luck|`|UwIpnN2Iaa	Yes, it's positive. I went to the doctor after I had a positive home pregnancy test, and they did a blood test just to confirm it. Good luck.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	any line in the positive window (no matter how faint) is a positive. The line shows up as the result of a chemical reaction to the pregnancy hormone in your urine, if there's no pregnancy hormone the line wont change if the line changes at all then there is pregnancy hormones so you are pregnant (unless your are taking some fertility treatments). Your next step is to make an appointment with your family doctor or obgyn, start taking prenatal vitamins (folic acid very important) and tell the father.|`|mcNt6Kapaa	You are pregnant. Make an appointment with your Ob/Gyn Asap.
Osn1xpu6aa	I'm planning on having sex with someone i find worthy of it.  that means i would love them.  it doesn't have to be marriage-it probably won't.|`|jPlUycx0aa	I am waiting until marriage because I want to give ALL of me to the man who is willing to wait and put a ring on my finger.  Some might disagree but, i think that every time you have sex with someone that you are not married to, they take a little bit away from you. Then by the time you meet Mr. Right he will see that you have been "had" by many others. I am a christian so of course I believe in abstinence.  You just don't want to give yourself away to some fool. If he or she ain't willing to wait until marriage then he or she not ready to be with you!!!|`|R47Bj9Q6aa	Not necessarily  but until Im 18+ and in a long committed loving relationship  im not overly religious and idk maybe i will wait but as long as im in a stable long term relationship i prob wouldn't as its a personal choice|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	not marriage. But I won't sleep with any guy until I'm 100% ready.|`|KwJDWvB3aa	i would only wait if the person im going to marry wants to wait|`|lc2WYfeTaa	I am married to my wonderful husband but, I didn't wait neither of us did actually!! But, my only issue with abstinence is that all of these girls and guys wait till they get married and then lose there virginity to each other etc.. a year or two goes by then they start to get curious as to what it would be like to sleep with someone else??!! Quite honestly a lot of marriages end because partners are just not compatible in bed and it happens. I'm not saying that I've slept around but some are better in bed than others! And if they don't end one partner is cheating! Very few marriages that are abstinent before last. I wish luck to who ever this works for etc.. but I just believe that two people have to be compatible in all aspects and intimacy is one of those important ones!!|`|mFC2RBL3aa	You don't have to wait till marriage. If your in love.|`|aSuLnvoSaa	im noowhere even near thinking about sex      see my other question|`|JnLoHaoAaa	That was my plan but it didn't quite work out that way|`|uZTLlAH9aa	I used to say I wasn't,  but now I've totally made the decision  That I am :)|`|FQ3mi15Qaa	no, i wont. its pointless.|`|wqRwSaGSaa	i didnt wait till marriage.  because i know my boyfriend is the person i am going to marry  and i love him.|`|vBahPYJGaa	i am waiting till marriage because i want to wait

For a girl name I think that since Taylor can be a girls name, so can Tyler. And if you would like to name her Tyler, spell it different, like Tylar, Tylor, Tyller. With a girly middle name for example, Tyler Marie, Tyler Jayne, Tyler Lynn, Tyler May.

It certainly isn't a child's name.   Therefore Lucky Lamb.
HuKDmP4Paa	Madelyn may be becoming popular, however I don't think that particular spelling is becoming to common. Also I think it's more the short form "Maddie". I think Jamie Lynn Spears named her daughter Maddie Bryan or something or another. But names come and go in cycles so if you decide not to use the name you could always pack it away for later years.    As for the name Rainee, I think it depends if you are trying to say Rain or Rainy, if it is just Rain I would consider chopping off an "e" to avoid any complication.  If it is Rainee I think the poor girl would get teased.     Kamyrn I think is a pretty name. Perhaps the middle name Grace goes with Kamyrn. Kamyrn Grace sounds very feminine and delicate, if that is what you are trying for a girl.     As for the Brian A comment on Deidra as a name, it looks to much like the name Deidara from the Japanese manga Naruto. As the name Deidara comes from the Japanese Folklore about a mountain.|`|bmoCpcdraa	kay|`|eKxPSMolaa	If you name a child Rainee, they may be made fun of. I think it is okay, but kids are mean!

4AO2myzKaa	1) Week 7-16  2) Nope  3) I don't know yet!  =)    However, I do think I found the trick to the morning sickness thing.  I found that if I woke up and drank a huge glass of water in the morning then I wouldn't throw up.  Why?  Apparently dehydration causes MS symptoms so it's sort of a never ending cycle.  I would feel the urge to vomit, but then my body realized it was "just water" and a few minutes later I could eat something and keep it down.  I told this to a friend who had three babies with BAD morning sickness and she said it has worked like a charm for her, that she's only thrown up once (and she's about 12 weeks now) and that was a day she didn't drink the water.  So, hope it works for you too!|`|Bs8sllD9aa	1) morning sickness most of the time subsides after the First trimester  2) eating crackers before getting out of bed helped with mine  3) I had my son on my due date (naturally)|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	1.

I am currently pregnant with Baby  2 and am 14 weeks pregnant and still have morning sickness.  Its getting better but it comes and goes.  2. I feel my morning sickness was contributed to being tired.  The days that I feel exhausted are the days that I am the worse.  When I'm sick I try to take it easy because doing exercise or any kind of strenous activity only makes it worse.  3. I delivered 5 days before my due date.  I was induced though due to  the baby being breech one week and not the next.  My doctor didn't want me to have a c-section if I didn't have to.|`|sOYUCM1vaa	I found I had it started at around 5-6 weeks and finished by around 11-12 weeks.  Lying down, on either side eased it. Sitting up, or moving made it worse.  We have 2 kids and the first was 2 days after her due date, the second was right on his due date.  I found crystallised ginger helped a little. Just nibbling on some. Not whole pieces at a time as they're very gingery (of course).The small amount of sugar on the ginger chunk eased it a little also I think.|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	With my first i was throwing up from conception till delivery and was throwing up during that too and absoultely nothing helped and with her they induced me a week early due to fetal distress and then did a c section a day later but i have an almost perfect 3 year old who is happy and healthy to show for it with my 2nd I'm 17 weeks pregnant and the morning sickness wasn't bad at all and magically stopped at 14 weeks haven't had a problem since then good luck with yours|`|3j6WdOX5aa	I am not a lady but you DONT need to be one to say congratulations|`|quieXSekaa	1) I felt nauseas for the first 3 or 4 months  2)lying down helped the most, moving made it worse  3) I delivered 9 days before his due date  hope this helped!|`|XI7JLX6gaa	lols to the 1st guy.  idk every women is diff   try going to you dr and ask whats best|`|Ez1eFeZ2aa	Hi and congrats.

So pretty close!|`|r35RX2Rzaa	-around 4 months but the 3 first where the worst.  -no only went for long walks.  - i was due on october 19 and had her the 18  - with second pregnancy i dint have any nausea and i didn't walk at all she was here almost 2 weeks before her due date.|`|bfQfeUq5aa	im sorry i cant really awnser your questiond (im 13) but congrats!  um i can awnser the last 1  ur baby doesnt always come ont he due date for example i was bron a month early  my friend was born on her due date   and my other firend was born a week after her due date  so it all depends on the   idk but u can never rly tell!  hope i helped with the little i offered|`|P37lIBr2aa	My morning sickness didn't really ever happen. I got nauseous from about week 8 til about week 16 but I never actually vomited. It came back a little while in my 3rd trimester on and off though.    Exercising for me was hard because I was just so fatigued all the time but I did start doing some prenatal yoga and it was a miracle worker! It kept me from feeling too stiff and helped my circulation and breathing a lot.    I havent actually delivered yet (due april 21st, 29w2d) but I'm crossing my fingers he comes just a week early! I'm carrying WAY out front and very low so it's pretty uncomfortable now lol.    Good luck and congratulations!|`|R34etqXNaa	i had morning sickness for 3 months. i deliver 1 month early its different for everone.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Keep in mind that every pregnancy is different...    Morning sickness stopped around 14-16 weeks  Exercise helped me alot with just the back pain  Didn't deliver yet.|`|MHyYQxEsaa	Congrats...    i hear this website can be VERY helpful.    Hope i'm right(:|`|AA11362517	For me my morning sickness wasn't typical for all 3 of my children I had severe morning sickness for the entire pregnancy. My doctor put me on medication for the nausea it did not help. I ended up weighing 20 to 30lbs less after I gave birth, than I did  before I was pregnant.    To answer question 2, No. I have a pretty physical job and work up until my 8 month, throwing up and all.    Within 2 weeks before due date. And I never knew I was in labor I had what seemed to be menstrual cramps and it progressed, but before it really bothered me I was already 4cm dilated. So just watch with that..But I have a high pain tolerance.|`|MQ34YW28aa	1. My morning sickness finally went away after my 14th week. Thank God!!!     2. I had to sit still and try to think of something else until the nausea would go away. Or munching on crackers and sprite seemed to help my nausea. But at night time I threw up no matter what I did.     3. I was induced at 38 weeks cause I had pre-eclampsia. My son still weighed 9lbs 10oz so in way I think it was a good thing that I had him early.     Congrats on your pregnancy!! It's honestly a great thing! Take care|`|DkLJgtEIaa	m sorry but i'm jus a teenage.......dunno abt pregnancy.
kaqPSgTVaa	Keep testing and don't get down. I had some months where I wasn't fertile until day 15. Day 12 is still fairly early enough in your cycle where I wuoldn't get worried. Also if you've never tested you may learn that you are one of the women that ovulate later in your cycle. Not everyone ovulates around day 14 and it can change from month to month.     If you don't get a reading this month wait and see what happens next month. If for two months in a row you are not getting an LH surge call your doctor and get tested. I know it's hard to wait but that's just what the doctor would tell you to do. Some months women don't release an egg.    Hang in there. I'm sure you will ovulate within the next few days. :) Good luck!|`|SzNmGV0Daa	Two things, you could be like me and ovulate on day 15 or 16, or you could not be ovulating. If you are not ovulating then they can put you on Clomid. Worse case scenario you could be like my cousin who was born with no follicles, which is very rare. You have to test ovulation to be sure of anything for at least two months. Due to the fact that you have two ovaries. One might not be dropping and the other could.Keep your head up and don't panic, it will work out, you just might need some help. Good luck and God bless.|`|S1AuL4SOaa	I have been using OPK this month and also had the same problem. I kept getting really frustrated because I wasn't getting a positive. I finally got a positive on day 18 and have had positives for three days after that too. Also, I know you are supposed to not use your first morning urine because it doesn't have as much LH in it. They say to test in the afternoon and the same time everyday. I hope this helps! Good Luck and lots of babydust :)
kOcYkte7aa	my period is actually due in 5 days also .even though its not the best of time for you to be pregnant i really hope you are god knows when and why he does things.don't be worried and lots of luck to both of us.hopefully you post your result..lotz and lotz of baby dust to us both.|`|9955049b1cf14ffa87b51ced7a9714abaa	before you go to take care of your sister you should make an appointment and get a blood pregnancy test done and find out for sure. i am hoping for the best for you..|`|93c02e5b1d7a30f862c52f37ff112c4aaa	yea if you cant get a doctor appointment go in and get lab work before you go...good luck

NqEZ120iaa	You sound like my husband! 2 year old's are supposed to whine!, it is in the make-up, just like the tantrums|`|th45yP4Xaa	Umm, it is normal. terrible twos? just put up with it, you cant stop it.|`|HB38sMkfaa	tell him/her not to whine and to talk.my daughter is 23 months and whines a lot now.(its really cute because she scrunches her face up to act like shes sad thinking she will get her way quicker- i have to try not to laugh or it hurts her feelings) i tell her dont whine just talk to me i cant hear you when you whine.if she keeps whining i ignore her then she will just say what she wants.|`|9ebd4faa5594adcf124de2b45c2667b2aa	Tell your child, no whining.  Don't give them what they want until they ask properly.  Teach them the proper way to ask.  You can also use positive reinforcement (a treat for proper behavior) or negative (time out or loss of something for whining).|`|RKOzbNLdaa	I have been a nanny for several years and I have found that there are lots of ways to get kids to spot whining.  One way is to pay no attention to his/her whining, if the kid sees that it doesnt do anything they will just stop, but if they see that it eritates you they will keep doing it. You can also try disciplining him/her for whining (nothing big, just like taking there favorite toy, time outs, no desert, things like that) and reward them for not whining.  Also on your part NEVER give in to the whining, once you do its soooooo hard to stop.|`|Q2Sx1Du3aa	my three year old does the same thing. When we have to leave grandma and grandpas house or if he wont eat we ask him if he wants to go to bed, he answers no, then the whining stops..  good luck!
5vtVsqx6aa	I like Layla better. Leila looks like Leela.     I really like the name Olivia, but it sounds like a tongue twister when you put them together.     I'd go with a different middle name.     Good luck!|`|glGVuKAEaa	They are both really pretty, but don't flow well together.  By the way, are you pronouncing it LIE-luh, LEE-luh or LAY-luh?    How about   Leila Bridget  Leila Charlotte  Leila Rebecca  Leila Katherine|`|26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	Having Leila and Olivia together, has like 6 I's and L's, so it looks a tad strange, and the Olivia doesn't flow.    Olivia Leigh Ryder?  Leila Ryder is adorable, but the Olivia didn't really fit.  Lelia Rose Ryder  Leila Grace Ryder  Leila Janae [Juh-nay] Ryder  Leila Christine Ryder  Leila Renee Ryder?    I really hope this helps.  Is is pronounced like Layla or like Leela?  I like it pronounced both ways, but pronouncing it Lee-la is much more unique :)    Leila is adorable. :)    x?o|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	A middle name is best as one sylablle|`|yNxYYHszaa	Leila and Olivia kind of sound the same. I read it once and it sounded good then I read it again and I didn't like it much. I really like both names so try and thing of something else.|`|2owaSpf0aa	I like the names individually, but together and with your surname they're not so great. All 3 names end in the same sound, try breaking it up a little bit with the middle name, ie Leila Eve Ryder, Leila Dawn Ryder.    I prefer the spelling of Leila.|`|MtoIxY6Qaa	it doesnt flow well.. sry!  but i love the name layla! how about..    layla lee  layla kate  layla rose  layla grace  layla eliza|`|icrsMzgiaa	the 'olivia' doesnt flow|`|YseGAHIfaa	i love it..!!|`|Gy9kt139aa	I loooooove it! Leila and Olivia are two of my favorite names and they sound gorgeous together!|`|0ayP21R9aa	Olivia doesnt sound that great in it. how about:Leila Grace,Leila Rose,Leila Marie|`|LTLFvphWaa	Hmm.. Its not really my style but if you like it!  =]|`|b4IK780Raa	Oh, I do not like that name. Another spelling fo Leila is Layla.|`|e4M4uQXNaa	Leila Ryder sounds beautiful!  And it's my favorite spelling of Leila too, though Layla Ryder does look cool too because of the Y's lol.    Olivia doesn't really flow with it though.  Too many L's and the double -a endings make it a bit of a tongue-twister lol.    Leila Sophie Ryder  Leila Gwendolen Ryder  Leila Margret Ryder  Leila Margot Ryder  Leila Eve Ryder  Leila Rachel Ryder  Leila Kate Ryder  Leila Annabel Ryder  Leila Zoe Ryder  Leila Rosaline Ryder  Leila Parker Ryder  Leila Megan Ryder  Leila Nicolette Ryder  Leila Audrey Ryder    I think my favorites are either Leila Rachel or Leila Zoe.

JnLoHaoAaa	How about $60 a day? That's $20 a day for each child|`|YxMh2aAOaa	75-100 a day i guess|`|ttT7W77gaa	1000|`|uf4oe9aVaa	100$ a day|`|0WstfAmzaa	I would charge by the week, and maybe somewhere around $350-500 for all three kids.|`|3MmVWDT3aa	I would say you should charge:    $30.00 per day for the 1 year old  $25.00 per day for the 3 year old  $20.00 per day for the 9 year old    The younger they get the more you should charge, and I think $75.00 would be a reasonable amount for how long you're doing this, including the nights.     That would come to a total of: $600.00- I think that is reasonable for that amount of time.
nrqWwQBXaa	i think that it is a bad idea. even though she is 16 she might not know what to do if some thing bad happened?|`|EtCRnDJMaa	Hell NO!|`|TQW5E6olaa	When my parent's went out of town when I was 16, I had raging parties.    No, take the baby with you.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I personally think its a bad idea.  Get a family or close (older, more mature) friend to watch your 1 year old.  The 16 year old could easily get frustrated with a 1 year old over 2 days.|`|AA11210211	I personally wouldn't do it not with a 1 yr old but you are her mother and you would know her best,If you think she is responsible enough...|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Nope. Not for a 1 year old, and definitely not for 2 nights. I'd have a family member come over and stay or at least have a neighbor or a friend check in every couple of hours. If you are concerned that your daughter may have friends over too, you absolutely shouldn't do it.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Get an adult to stay with the both of them.  I mean an adult that's old enough to be the 16 yr old's parent.|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	I'm 14 and my mom would never leave me with that kind of responsibility. Though i'm a very responsible person, it would be inappropriate as taking care of a baby for an entire weekend is too much of a burden to put on a teen.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	You'd have to lay down the law about what she is allowed to do and isn't allowed to do, but, inevitably she is 16 and at that age the circutry doesn't always connect (if you know what I mean) lol.  We have twin girls 16 and we've left them overnight with thier brother at 8 and younger, but there were relatives close by etc but I wasn't very comfortable with it.  One time they did make some bad choices that could have gotten all three of them in serious danger and bad situations.  Honestly, unless she has some real close backup to ensure she is being safe and responsible, I wouldn't do it.|`|ylgNuE3uaa	Seems old enough as long as your teen has the necessary responsibility and experience.    However, I know a couple of families who found that even the most responsible teenager may not know how to handle an infant or toddler in the event of an emergency.    Calling 911 isn't the only thing they need to know.   Hopefully you have talked in great depth about a procedure for any kind of emergency scenario.    Fire, medical... Every possible scenario.|`|3b042baeb993c8dc0d7c7bc9bc4817f2aa	I think you're absolutely completely and totally nuts for even considering this.  The 16 year old should be left with an adult, let alone being left to care for a one year old.    No way, and if you do this, you are negligent.  I can't believe any parent would consider this.    Do you realize that your 16 year old cannot legally obtain medical treatment for herself, let alone your one year old.    My kids are 6 and 2, I've only left the 6 year old overnight once, with my mother to have the 2 year old.  I've never left her overnight...and if I did it would be with their grandmother or my husband.|`|10mOwk0Taa	If you think she's responsible and won't have a party or something then its ok.  My mom would've left me, and she probably would've allowed my to invite one girlfriend over to spend the night for the weekend as company and help.  But I grew up babysitting and nannying for money from age 11.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	I would not leave her home with him unless she is the most responsible teenager ever.  If you trust her completely and she's willing to do it, then I would leave her.  But I would give her a big reward and plenty of emergency contact numbers in case something happens.|`|bXGgFhRjaa	It depends on how responsible your daughter is. Is she a party girl? Is she irresponsible? Has she slacked off in taking care of your daughter before? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then it was probably a bad idea to leave her with your baby.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	Well, you know your child best as far as responsibility goes. I personally wouldn't do it.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Your already douting her so why ask us?  you said you hope she can and you dont know if she will invite friends over. Sounds like you answered your own question.|`|oM6Pem1Waa	I don't think you should do that because she is little and she can do something bad.|`|2jMFurDoaa	i wouldnt do it.  find an adult to watch/take care of the baby.|`|iHkbrJF1aa	No I personally would not leave a 16 to do that. Its too much responsibility and not forgetting its into the night too. Try asking a friend, god parent, grand parent or any other trusted adult to look after your baby, for peace of mind.|`|NJK2ypmsaa	Um, I'm 17 and I will say no. I don't think she'd really want to be watching your daughter all the time... sorry.|`|2xS1Jro7aa	if she is responsible and good with the 1 year old then yes but I would have a friend or relative check in a few times a day and tell you daughter this and that they will stop in randomly to see how things are going. Also give her numbers of friends/relatives (let them know first) that if she gets stressed at all she can contact them. Also talk to her about shaken baby syndrome and so on (that can happen to a child up to the age of 7 not just a baby). I think if you followed those things she would be totally fine I mean think of it this day there are 13 year olds who have babies these days and take care of them their self. If your 1 year old can not be with you then your 16 year old is most likely the best person to make her feel comfortable. Good luck!|`|DPegPYRPaa	I don't think that is a good idea.

hqogf9oGaa	I can understand why you may be worried but this is all to do with how children develop bonds and learn social interacion.    For example, in the first few weeks babies will respond to any attention, there are stages inbetween however, from around 6-8 months the baby/child will form their first specific attachment (usually to the Mother but it can be a Father etc if they are the primary carer).  The baby will display distress if away from the attachment figure etc.  Usually, around a month after this behviour is displayed the child will show fear of strangers (which is an important lesson I am sure you will agree) and following this, within quite a short space of time, the baby will then begin to form attachments to other people they know and have learned to trust.    It is suggested that the experience whilst forming this first specific attachment be as positive as possible as it builds the foundations for how the child will build all new relationships throughout their lives.    I know that it must not be easy being in such high demand and will no doubt be very tiring but this phase will pass.      It sounds to me as though your son is developing right on time.  It will help him though if he can see you most of the time - he doesn't need to be picked up and carried around all the time but he needs to know that you are there so that he feels secure.    Wishing you the best of luck!    Indigo    xxx|`|2Jzz5Kwkaa	Put him in a crib with soft padding and let him cry if you're sure he doesn't want food / diaper change.|`|ULgGWDnWaa	its attachment and is normal for his age, he will grow out of it but when is the problem! you should leave him cry, but no more than 10Min's, does he go to creche, if not look into leaving him with family and friends so that he gets used to you going and coming back! NEVER sneak off always say goodbye! leave the room even when it is not necessary and when you come back in pick him up and give him a cuddle and put him back down! don't rush in just do it calmly! unfortunately all children go threw this stage, he just needs to learn that you will come back!|`|NpSVEC2naa	i haven't experienced this prob but i would try getting someone who he knows to look after him for a few hours a couple times a week. i think its very important to get babies socialized from an early age. plus it gives you and your hubby some time to yourselves. you could also try taking him out to other peoples places to get him used to being around different people.    hope this helps|`|AEZ0CpZnaa	an hour seems quite a bit to leave a child, who will only become more anxious and therefore exacerbate the problem, a routine is what is needed. He will get used to sleeping at a certain time and having fun at other times and eating at others. But your son while awake will want to have you in, or alternative adult, in vision to feel safe, put him on the floor he won't fall off and talk, sing and keep contact of sorts with him, he will learn by this behaviour. Try to minimalise background noise like music or tv as this only distracts him, you soon will have a happy mix, good luck|`|rftEZA50aa	He will grow out of it eventually, my son did.

It helped me understand that the more secure a child is the more it will be able to take on the world by its self.  First and foremost a child needs security. If a parent leaves a child the child has no idea that the parent will be back but believes it has been abandoned.  The reason the child is clinging is because it is afraid of being abandoned again.  What I would suggest is not to let the child be by itself.  After a week or so try leaving the room for a few seconds and return so that the child learns that you are coming back.  Gradually building to a minute or two. Remember this is not an intellectual thing for the child, it is a response to fear.  I know this is difficult but the child will need to build up a trust.  The child will only stop clinging when it is secure in the knowledge that you aren't going to disappear.  I would suggest that you get as much help as possible from friends and family to help both you and the child get through this difficult period.    Good luck!|`|nwWBddEnaa	could be teething?, my daughter is 7 months as well and is getting her first tooth through, she is exactly the same, its a clingy stage that they go through. if i'm in another room and she starts crying i usually call out to her so she know that i'm still around even though she can't see me and we play peek-a-boo at first it was hands over the face, then covering the face and then it was behind the doors, i hope this helps, i wish you the best of luck x|`|ZVCm3XAEaa	My daughter was exactly the same, I couldn't leave the room without her screaming, as far as she was concerned I was leaving forever!

From what I've read it starts around 7 to 8 months and lasts for a few months.  My question to you would be, does he regularly spend time with other people?  For instance, realtives or family friends?  My daughter is a little over 7 months old and sees her grandparents and aunt weekly (even stays over at their houses every now and then).  So far she has no symptoms of this "seperation anxiety".  Of course she may get it in the next month or so.  Hope that helps :)|`|6jSxYrZnaa	Chris K is right.

And that lasted for about 4 months. and dont press down too hard just in case.|`|AOfm8ey6aa	At one month I knew I was pregnant, physically you really can't feel it, but all the hormones in my system have let me known I was pregnant before the pregnancy test had. I just felt it, plus I felt kinda warm tingling sensation in my uterus. It might have been just psychological (=I was imagining it), but I would swear I really felt it. :o)|`|OBuzcIDbaa	You won't be able to feel the baby this early.

The only thing that can tell you for sure is a pregnancy test.
Ep0CpwDbaa	I prefer Katherine. I think the spelling Catherine seems more motherly and gentle, but Katherine is strong, powerful, and beautiful. The latter traits just attract me more.    Catherine also seems a bit plain compared to Katherine. Catherine strikes me as a middle-aged woman with a very traditional air. Katherine seems to be better suited for most other personalities, in my opinion.|`|xLabGD6Maa	Katherine|`|ej51eWO7aa	Katherine...it looks better. :)|`|sgHvnxe2aa	I actually like them both. Katherine reminds me of the Russian queen  in the 18th century....They had a mini-series on it years ago....    I think Catherine might be more Irish than English...Not sure...but I like  it also...like with BRIDGET as a middle name maybe....|`|5vtVsqx6aa	I also like the "K" better and I agree, it's somehow stronger.|`|YqoxcTN9aa	i totally agree with you, Katherine|`|miFe45quaa	I like Catherine best, it looks more gentle and kind.  I know a Katherine and she just affects my opinion I guess.    I really like Catherine, it's pretty. The spelling with a "K" just bothers me...not sure why.|`|3211ed41e3e48685000da1909bc1332aaa	i think Katherine because it seems more... pretty than Catherine...    also few people that i know have there names spelled with a K...|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I prefer it with a "K"|`|lAc7NJTUaa	katherine because its a beautiful name and what you said is definitely right. congrats!!|`|d6e11chxaa	Katherine or Catherine, never Kathryn! As a Katherine Elizabeth, I tend to like the K, but it depends on the name you pair it with, too. Catherine can add a bit more class to a trendier name, and Katherine looks a bit more modern if you're pairing with another classic name.|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Katherine. I know that Catherine is the original spelling but Katherine is so much more feminine. It also can have the nickname Kate then which I think is gorgeous :)|`|fAFJ8sHJaa	Katherine!  :)|`|WEYA89znaa	I like Catherine. I think it is more girlie and classy.   There is this girl in my grade that spells it   Kathryn and I like that way 2!|`|M21p76wQaa	Catherine, because Katherine looks like a misspelling.|`|66cb1b024847c91f73947f8666fdf56daa	I prefer Katharine. I think it looks stronger than with and E or a C.|`|FN5rFBgSaa	Katherine .  i like Kathryn the best . but out of your two spellings Katherine is best, and i just like it better with the K because the C doesnt look as good in my opinion.|`|sh5W8poAaa	I am conflicted about this one because I prefer the spelling of Catherine, but to shorten it to Kate I prefer it with a K rather then with a C.  If that made any sense.|`|AA12069197	I like KathArine but its all up to you!|`|lvXxy1odaa	Katherine or maybe Kathryn?|`|DCJAMtkHaa	I actually prefer Catherine, which is the original english spelling.  I.e. the two wives of Henry VII, the Queen of Russia or one of the 7 saints spelled it Catherine.  I think it looks softer and classier.  It's also the spelling I am most accustomed to - I live in a very VERY English community in British Columbia.    I also just generally prefer 'c' spellings in general (i.e. Cara over Kara)|`|SMhcM5Cxaa	Catherine. its more girly.|`|gPE0wRTGaa	Catherine.  Katherine seems really trendy, and in the moment with the K. I think Catherine is really classic and will always be in.|`|RPszYGXkaa	I prefer Katherine.  I just like the "K" better than the "C"...which is why I named my baby Karoline, vs Caroline.|`|CSzDV3gEaa	i like Katherine more. I like the nickname Kat with a K too.
2TrHH0rkaa	I like Katherine the best out of the first three.    Genevieve is a little too long for and I prefer Evelyn with the nickname Eve    Felicity is pretty although I worry that it would get stereotyped to be another name like Joy or Charity    Alice and Rose are both great names although I would have to pick Rose. Katherine Rose or Alice Rose would sound great :)|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	genevieve rose|`|tj0Vss90aa	I like Genevieve, Felicity, Alice and Rose!!!    1. 1st Felicity 2nd Genevieve  2.

No offense.|`|hSTNMnFPaa	I love, love, love Genevieve and Felicity! Such gorgeous names!

LTD0qL6Yaa	Absolutely.....Every time a man ejaculates strait away he starts producing more sperm for possible pregnancy the next time he he has sex. Men expel MILLIONS of sperm "Every" time they ejaculate. You could definitely be pregnant....|`|x52tr87Yaa	Most men have plenty of sperm! I know of couples who have sex everyday and fall pregnant.|`|VS8mactUaa	Yes, it is possible that you could have gotten pregnant, much too early to tell but, A man can have sex every night and still be able to get a woman pregnant.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yeah he should have had enough. :) Sperm replenishes after every ejaculation given enough time. 24 hours should be plenty of time. :) Good luck!|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Yes. There is enough sperm to make you pregnant.|`|qN5iVvAFaa	that should be no problem, unlike women men make more sperm every day...|`|rFMRgHTdaa	your husband has enough sperm to get you pregnant remember it only takes 1 of those guys to get you pregnant anyways. Im sure he released more than 1.|`|SzNmGV0Daa	Anytime you are trying to conceive, DON'T USE A CONDOM! Just in case the test is off you want to up your chances at any cost. Fortunately for men they replenish their supplies daily. Goodluck|`|eD0MVJxUaa	Yes.  His sperm count will be lower, however, you can still get pregnant.  This doesn't mean you will get pregnant though.  Wish you the best!
1tmX7xbRaa	yes it's completely ok for her and you won't hurt the baby. as she gets bigger it will be harder to find a position that is comfortable for her so don't get discouraged just try different ways until she is comfortable. and as she gets closer to the end 'they' say that sex can actually help enduce labor.|`|cCsN3tcZaa	yes.. my fren is 5 months pregnant and she still do|`|gyoylefvaa	YES, GO FOR IT.|`|0RFUKkBLaa	Yes it is very safe, it wont cause her any harm unless it is causing her pain but alot of women dont experience pain during sex untill there further on in their pregnancy. As for baby it wont harm it at all as there is a mucous plug protecting baby.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	It will not hurt the baby - it is perfectly safe to have sex until her waters break|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	it should be fine unless the dr advised against it.   I was advised against for the first 12 wks due to a small bleed seen on my ultrasound but i am 40 + wks now and good to go.  We resumed sex after the 12 wks and all is great!|`|NLjAPHx0aa	As long as her doc says its okay then its fine. I'm 4 months and doc asked me not to have inter course right now. everyone is different.|`|6yy0jtzDaa	its very safe the baby is in a very protective sac and the gentle rocking may put him/her to sleep you won't be squishing it or poking it in the head a woman body is a wonderful thing and it doesn't forget about protecting it young growing baby either she could actually fall flat on her stomach at 8 months pregnant and the baby will be fine|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	Only if she has been checked by her doctor and he has okayed it. It should be okay though. I am 9 months pregnant and we still have sex sometimes but it's very uncomfortable so try to enjoy it while you still can.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	Of course it is!!  You can have sex right up until the baby is born!  However, once she reaches full term, the sperm and her orgasm can trigger labour, but only if she is ready or close to ready.    But believe me, when I was pregnant I couldn't get enough sex - the hormones do that to you.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    it is okay to have intercourse. But if you are certainly uncomfortable for not wanting to hurt bubs inside. Definitely see your doctor first to get the okay. they know best. and its safe for her and baby. As long as its not a high risk pregnancy and okay is given from doctor.    god bless x|`|QYYWBrG7aa	Its impossible to hurt the baby while having sex.i promise u ur NOT that gifted in size to reach the baby..|`|VUss5AfAaa	no mans penis is large enough to reach to the cervix.  so baby is safe.  dont worry, onless she expirience bleeding after she should ask a doctor if its safe.  but other than that jump on it.  it will help her with some stress as well for you!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Yes, you can for the entire pregnancy unless her doc tells her otherwise due to complications. I don't think any man would get their wives pregnant if they couldn't have sex for the whole time. :]
0Id85yiYaa	take a test|`|4KT1cXMBaa	Well first, why would you have sex on a tuesday any way?  I'm sorry I dont know what to tell you.   Good Luck!|`|X2EPEEwbaa	if you didn't want it to happen, then you shouldn't have had sex.  wait and see if you miss a period.  then take a test.|`|qN5iVvAFaa	If you didn't want this to happen then why aren't you on bc, or using a condom??? besides that that was only about a week ago, wait until you miss your period. then take a test. it could just be your body reacting to something that has changed|`|ykP7I3caaa	If you know what ovulating is, I don't really believe you had no idea that means your MOST FERTILE day. This is annoying.|`|7cvoxQitaa	At 15, it's great that you know your body well enough to know when you are ovulating. But sadly, yes, sex during ovulation is a great time for conception. If you are pregnant, you would only be a little more than a week along. Not far enough in to be having "pregnancy symptoms". Those symptoms you are having seems to be related to stress. At 15 though, you have some decisions to make if you are pregnant. Please consider adoption if you do not plan on keeping the child. But, being a teen mother is hard as hell, but possible and worth it! I went through hell with my daughter when I was a teen mom, but she taught me to grow up, and if it weren't for her, I'd probably be dead or in jail right now. Me and my husband have been trying for years to have another, but we have not been successful and I thank God everyday for giving me the one I had, even when everyone thought it was a mistake. Having a child is the best thing that has ever happened to me, and if my daughter were to get pregnant at 15, yes I would be disappointed, but it wouldn't be the end of the world. Teen pregnancy is not the worst thing that can happen, it makes things a bit more difficult and you would lose out on quite a few "normal" opportunities that most high school females enjoy, but then again, you would be experiencing a whole would of joy that they do not know yet. What ever happens, I wish you the best. Do not let anyone talk down to you or amke you feel like crap, we all make mistakes, we have all made poor chioces. As long as you learn from the mistakes you have made, you should be proud of yourself. If you are pregnant and you keep the baby, you deserve praise as well. With so many teens killing their babies or dumping them, or even giving them up and never thinking twice about it, any teen mom that does the right thing, is already in a league of her own!! You are in my thoughts.|`|a86IJoFjaa	If you didn't want it to happen you shouldn't have had sex.   But yes, having sex on your ovulation day is a very good way to get pregnant. But you wouldn't be showing symptoms already,. you're just being paranoid.  Wait until a few days after your period. If it's late, take a test. That's really all you can do.|`|wPtX51cjaa	yes it does make it a higher chance of getting preg.  just go by when your supposed to start your period and you can try a test a few days before your supposed to start, but might be more accurate if you wait until you think your late.  dont stress out to much bc it could cause it to be late and scare you even more. if you do find out your preg go to the doctor and they will tell you from there. if you need to know sooner i think they could tell from a blood test at a doctor by now since its been about a week.|`|AA11362517	Take a test, get tested for STDS while your at it. If you don't want children or can not raise them. Don't have sex. It's that simple. One night can change your whole life. Its not worth it. Go to school, go to college , get a job, get married, or whatever, just live your life before you carelessly bring another one into the world. You owe that to yourself and any children in the future you plan on having.   Get on birth control, use condoms, don't have sex. Maybe your stomach hurts because he gave you an std, get checked out.|`|QPZTCUfdaa	Anytime you have sex, ovulating or not you can get pregnant. You should know that teenage women are at higher risk of complications, miscarriage and low birth weight...but it doesn't alwaya happen that way-you could have no problems at all.    When you tell your parents, expect them to be a little disappointed, but hopefully they will choose to support you either way and help you make the best choice...    Also keep in mind that you have options. Just because you are young doesn't mean you won't be a good mother-so don't listen to the people who will judge and critisize you.    If you suspect you are pregnant you need to get to a doctor ASAP to get the proper prenatal care to ensure a safe and helathy pregnancy. If you miss your next period, there's a good chance you might be pregnant.    Last but not least, being a mom is the best feeling in the world. You will love your baby more than anyone in the whole world...even though it's not always easy and can be very stressful, it's worth it. Best of luck to you!|`|rctDnhO1aa	if you were ovulating then i think you have more of a risk, (because women who are trying to get pregnant sometimes use charts to find out when they are ovulating so they can plan to have sex that day) signs that you are pregnant include breast tenderness/achiness stomach pains vomiting etc if you are pregnant (i suggest you take a test soon) and not planning on getting an abortion do not drink caffeine (it can kill the baby) or take any medication until you've talked to a dr (advil can harm the baby too) if you don't want the baby but don't want an abortion there is always adoption.  there are a lot of women out there who really want a child but are unable to conceive.  also stay away from cat litter and if you don't eat healthy at all and you are pregnant and planning to continue with it, you should start taking a prenatal vitamin (sold over the counter at places like whole foods and probably walgreens etc) but if you can get a prescription prenatal vitamin those are better.|`|aHBh67n6aa	im not trying to be mean to you but i think at 15 you should not be having unprotected sex (i was 15 once and i know what its like, i understand if you wanna have sex i just think you should be using protection) cos its not just pregnancy to be worried about but im not gonna give you a lecture on it- but i will tell you this, the pregnancy hormone wont show positive on a test until around the day your period is due, sometimes even after that but it will be in your blood from the very early stages so you could go to your doctor and ask if they could do a blood test to find out earlier (this would be a good option for you as it will give you a little bit extra time to work out what you will do) if the test is negative the doc would also be able to give you some tips on contraception too, cos your over 14 you can take the pill  and your parents dont need to give consent. however i strongly think that you should talk to your mum (if you can) i fell pregnant at 19 and found that my mum was the best support person in my life. and i know its gonna sound stupid but try not to stress as that can delay your period.. good luck, and keep us posted.|`|IU0LQQw8aa	there is a much higher risk of getting pregnant on your ovulation day.  wait untill you see if you have a missed period, then take a test.

7iMZ91K7aa	I don't know, I don't want to say that I feel like this is my month, because I don't want to be wrong... but I don't know, I just feel... I cant even explain it.. I have been having very slight, weird cramps... and waves of nausea coming and going... but it could all be in my head.. I guess we'll have to see :)|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	well myself is in the tww and it bites. i hate waiting. but what i am experiencing going to the bathroom more than normal, notice a pink spot on the 2nd and feeling really tired.|`|s519vyP5aa	OK let me tell you my story i took a test on sunday of the superbowl and i got a faint line but it was there but 3 days before i took the test i had a dream the only thing i saw in the dream was the test in front of my face where the 2 lines came up that day i had the dream i had really light cramping and i felt i small tap on my right side the next day the same thing happened except the tap was on the left side i have 4 yr old twins and a 2 yr old that was had a vanishing twin my period is not due till the 10 of this month and i have taken about 5 hpt and all were positive when i went to the doc the test was PFN so she told me to do a blood test that i will not have results for about 3 - 4 days .. for my test to come out so early i think am having twins Again..  my back is hurting my breast are sore and am feeling tired and sleeping but good luck hope u the best
hzgFAJv0aa	I think in infant adoption (which I dislike) it is a slap in the face to the first parents if they have named the child. These things should be talked about and agreed on before the adoption is final. Even four people can agree on a couple of names - bands and law firms do it all the time.    In older children, I think it should be a child's choice to legally change their first and middle names. There is no reason why APs can't call a child by whatever name or nickname they choose while keeping at least a part of the child's original name.    Re-naming a child just because you can smacks of ownership to me - unless a child has a truly horrid name that could be construed in a negative way and cause harm to the child.    JMHO.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	I was adopted at 24 months and my parent's changed my name completely.  39 years later I have had no problems with it at all.  I certainly don't remember being called "Jennifer Lynn" ever.|`|7hZ2yzK4aa	Your kid now. You decide.|`|ALyHiGGgaa	well since the baby is going into a new life then changing the name should be fair!|`|uQoBeM0Xaa	Change it if the kid wants it too. Well if the adopted kid is something like 1 year old or 2 years old then itd be okay but if the kid is older... like already 9? then you better let it be.|`|pSO8ecEnaa	All depends , if the baby is more then even a few weeks old, then i think it's counterproductive.Baby's respond to their names in the fisrt few weeks of life.|`|NdKuSlVsaa	I'd say that if the child is old enough to know their own name, then it should not be changed. That would get confusing for the child, and could end up with them having a feeling of lost identity when they get older.    If they are a baby though, or extremely young, I feel that it's ok to change the name because they will not remember their original name. When they got older though, I would tell them their original name, and help them understand their heritage.|`|b9cdd3f6ee809db2bfe1d4f637237fbfaa	If the child is an infant it has no effect on him so I think it is perfectly fine but I think if the child were older you ought to consider the effects on them as well and all the other new adjustments they have to go through. If they are old enough to recognize their name and wouldn't.|`|p9mB8Z2Kaa	Well I wouldn't   It just wouldn't feel right to change a name that it's real parents gave it.  I would just leave it the way it is  :)|`|Xtqq71KGaa	it's a baby, so probably won't be a big deal.  but are you changing it b/c you really dislike the current name, or b/c you've always dreamed of naming a kid something in particular?  i don't think you should do it unless you really dislike the current name for some reason, like if it's the same name as someone you can't stand.|`|qQA94jPXaa	um all i can say is if its a baby i guess its more ok than if they are a child because i was 6 years old and someone tried to change my name completely. that was pretty stupid and i was old enough to know my own name........|`|DmJFln79aa	I think it depends on the child's age, the relationship with the biological family and the child's wishes.    If the child is old enough to recognize their name, I think it's probably best not to change it.      If you have a relationship with the biological family, work with them for a name you all like.      If the child is old enough to express their desire, 'nuff said.|`|0e3ab32d21f7e1a84db9f6aba393f6b4aa	if age is equal or less thank 3 go ahead,  he will get used to the new name, if not, he will not be happy with your name, and will not get close to you easily.|`|6orvPrLLaa	self-serving.  doesn't benefit the child.    ETA: i recently "adopted" *don't fall out of your chairs, folks* a BOXER PUPPY. i did NOT change his name, because this was the name he'd known and responded to.  i only wish people showed that much respect for their human children.|`|w2NA1KuXaa	I think that every effort should be made to keep the name (barring something insulting) whether the child is 2 months, 2 years, whatever.  I think it is an important part of the child's history, and should be honoured.|`|984c0feac5fcb2b2527360725a42fac5aa	I think it is okay to change the name of a child that is under a year old.      It can be okay to change the name if the child is older depending on the situation.  For example, our friend did this because her adoptive sons had been physically and sexually abused, and this was part of breaking with that past.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I think the child should keep his or her name.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Never.  A name is a gift from the natural mother, and the adoptive parents should do all they can to make the adoption for the child, not for themselves.  The name should stay.  Babies know their names much earlier on than most people think.  They've already lost their family, at least let them keep the name.    To the answerer who said something about the baby having a "new life"... Ignorant!  The baby is not a clean slate.  They have a life and a heritage that is indelible.  Changing the name isn't going to make the baby "belong" to the parents any more than keeping the name the same.|`|AA10736763	I have adopted three times from foster care.  The first child, I moved his first name to his middle name, and gave him a new first name.  The second and third time, we adopted a little girl, and a year later, her baby brother.  I kept the little girl's name the same, because it was beautiful, and the middle name was the same as my husband's middle name.  The next time, we had opened the adoption of our daughter to her extended family, and I hated to change the baby boy's name because of that.  His middle name was his grandfathers, so what I did was add my own father's name to the middle, too.  Now he has the same first name, and both his biological and his adoptive grandfather's names!|`|pTcyhs9Maa	If you are adopting a baby then I think it's perfectly fine to change their name when you adopt.  You probably have favorite names already picked out - most people do.  Go with one of those.  Personally, I didn't adopt but if I did I would probably change the name.    However, if you are adopting an older child I wouldn't consider changing the first name - the child already has a sense of identity.  However you can change the child's last name to match yours.    Everyone will have different opinions on this.  I have a close friend who is adopted and when she found out her real name (her parents changed it when they adopted her at birth) she was really upset about it being changed.  But I have another friend who was adopted at 8 months and she found out her parents changed her name and she didn't care at all.  She just laughs and said that at least they picked a good name (plus she didn't really care for the name her birth mother gave her).      No matter what decision you make some people will disagree with you - so just go with what feels right to you.|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	A baby can respond to his or her name at 4-6 months of age. Changing it afterward is confusing and wrong.    My husbands name was changed when he was adopted at age 14. To change a name at that age is to consider the child property. It is wrong. Children are not property. They are human beings. The responses like "it is yours now" is sick and appalling.    Changing a last name is legally required, therefore I have no opinion on that subject matter.|`|C78FwcBraa	its ok to do that because the baby is still young they wont know there first name|`|ce16zE8Raa	I would go for it if you are the adoptive parents, it is your baby. It is not about "ownership", but about belonging. If the baby's original name wasn't terrible maybe make it his/her middle name and also if the birth parents seemed super attached/involved (many birth parents do not give 2 craps about what they named their baby, and you are taking responsability for them you should have the honor of renaming your baby and letting the baby know you love them and cared enough to pick a special name out for THEM in YOUR family).    I had a friend named Colin whose birth parents named him Sasha Karma Dragon..... let's just say he was very happy his parents changed it!|`|jaAolejUaa	it would confuse the child|`|WJjfrf0Caa	it depends on 2 things:    who named the child  how old is the child    if the child is older that 1 year I would say do not change the name. this might confuse the child    ultimately,if you really really don't like the name then you can change it, but hopefully you will just realize that a name is just a name and there is no real reason to change it. hopefully you will love the child no matter what the name is.|`|WdW1ga14aa	Are ypu asking about changing the baby's entire name or just their last name.  That is your choice and you do what is best for you.  If I was to adopt a baby I would change their name so that it would match with mine.    Good luck|`|xxSGhywoaa	I'd do it.  If the child can speak, I'd ask if they wanted to change their name.|`|Ya2ayYE4aa	I know a guy who has a different names than what his parents gave him-he doesn't like it because it's too unique, i don't know if he likes it at all, but he's adopted, and it's a secret what his name is, which i think means that he doesn't like his real name. I don't really think people have a right to change an odopted child's name, honestly even though i LOVE the name he goes by, it's so cool :)|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	Change it if you want to! It is best if they are a baby though. That is very common and acceptable (especially if they are named something weird) If they are already used to their name because they are old enough, it might not be a good idea to confuse them though. If they are old though, you can ask them what they'd like to be called. My bf's parents did that there was a young kid named jamie and they changed it to jameson and the older one was like 3 or 4 and he decided he wanted to be called peter instead of brian and that is now his name and he is mid-twenties.|`|SG6sOaVtaa	I think that since you are adopting it, you should have the right to change the name, if you decide..|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I think the parents should be comfortable with the child as their child so Yes.|`|xK2IMLPLaa	I would move the baby's first name to his/her middle name.  That way they still have part of their birth family but your happy about their name!|`|2wyDALHgaa	The question was posted 27 minutes ago and already over 30 answers?  Boy, some questions really strike a nerve.    Both of my daughters names were changed upon their adoption.  Our oldest was changed from what we thought was a very ethnic name from overseas to one with ties to the country she was born in but with a more western sound.  The youngest has essentially the same name however we shortened it just a bit, again because we didn't like the sound of what she was given (actually, any one of the three versions she was given by her birth mother at the hospital when she was still high and since she put even a fourth name down on the registry paperwork we didn't feel compelled to keep any of them but we did).    We only did this given the ages of the children when they came to us (8 months and 4 days respectively) and we wouldn't have done it officially if they were older.  We would have kept them on the papers but just used something different as a "nick name".      If people agree with it...great.  If people don't agree with it...thats fair.  Its our call and we made it.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I have no problem with changing a name. Like many others have said age should be a consideration. If the child is old enough they should have input and if they wish to keep their original name they should be allowed.     A name doesn't have to be insulting/offensive to be harmful for the child. There have been a number of studies that show that extremely unique names or ones with spelling errors, etc. do cause harm for the child and their success in life. They may have more trouble in school or getting a job.     I'm planning on adopting older kids at some point so they will very much know their names and there won't be much to do about that. In my research I happen upon the foster/adoption websites from time to time and honestly some of the names are so incredibly horrible that I would have a hard time calling the child by that name. With many all you can think is why in the world would they name the child that? or siblings with the same name but different spellings or some even with the exact same spelling.      So I guess if I didn't mind the name the family had picked I would keep it. If it was one that I think would harm the child's future I wouldn't hesitate for a second to change the name. This would apply more for infant adoption I guess.|`|zLoyo24Taa	It depends on the child's age.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	It depends on how old the child is. If they're under 3 and they have a name that you don't like the i don't see the problem. It's your child and you have a right to name him/her.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	I think its odd and disrespectful both to the achild and the natural parents.      Its another obvious indicator that Paps are looking for replacement babies for the ones they cannot give birth to.|`|pWA3gybAaa	yes change it|`|gSwobfujaa	if they are too young to understand then i think its okay. but if they are old enough to know their name and know that it is being changed then that isnt very fair.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	It depends, if the baby is 2 months old then he will not know that his name was changed.  I the baby is 2 years old that could potentially be very confusing.|`|AA11595360	i would only worry about it if the child knows his or her name. If they are young enough then it wont matter... Dont worry about anyone except you and the child.|`|GBZQP5pAaa	I think if the child is old enough to know and SPEAK his/her name, it should not be changed. If the child does not know their name-probably an infant, it would be ok.|`|224cm8qtaa	It will depend on the kids age. Are you talking about first names or last names? Last names - def. ALWAYS. First names... if you want to if the child is older than let the child decide.|`|JP04HX6maa	I'll break the monotomy here and say: why not *ADD* instead of *CHANGE*?    What's wrong with keeping their original name and adding an English one to it?|`|TufsEE2baa	Names seem to have very important social consequences I think a name change is appropriate. I think the mother put her baby up for adoption for a better life and a good name can make a difference.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Unless it is an extremely offensive name that will cause the child grief while growing up, (like Jack MaHog, Ima Ho, Saphyllis Jane or Dick Weed) I think it is a nice gesture to keep the original name. It honors the child's first parent and acknowledges the child's past.|`|HmkCFddAaa	It is the adoptive parents right to change the name if they want. If the child is older you might want to discuss it with them and maybe let them have some input on what they would like.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	I'm going to disagree with those who say it's no big deal to change a baby's name because they won't know.    I was adopted as a baby and I know!   It meant alot to me to know that my adoptive parents honored and kept my given name.    If a child has a name, why change it?  I think people who do that are claiming 'ownership' of their kids and headed for a fall; you don't own your children and the relationship between you will be closer if you honor who they are and where they come from, and that includes not dispensing with their name!|`|BTuFtui3aa	I would only change an adopted child's name under one of the following circumstances:    1.) Safety. If the child would be put in danger by being located by abusive biological parents, the name would need to be changed, especially if it was relatively unique or recognizable.    2.) Older child's request. Some children who are old enough to voice an opinion want a new name in a new family, especially if they associate being called their old name with abuse.    3.) Name is a serious social handicap. Not something I personally don't care for, but is actually going to cause problems or potential harm later in life. Examples: Adolf Hitler. Lucifer. While a lovely name in Vietnam, Phuc would cause huge misunderstandings for English speakers.    I would change the name if it was necessary or desired by the child, but keep it otherwise.|`|vwTyihvvaa	If the child is between the ages of 0 months and 1, it is easier to change the name as there less likely to be confusion, easier to adjust to.    If the child is between 1 and 5 generally the first name is kept, for although if they child goes by say Nikki and that was the legal first name, you could still can her Nikki as a nickname and use Nicole as the legal first name.    However, I find from about five up usually the first name stays the same as it would be quite confusing if you were to change the name.     But if you were adopting an older child, even when it comes to a last name often they are asked if they want to keep their biological last name or change it to the adoptive family's last name.    However, if I adopted myself, I would if it was an infant, change the first name if I did not truly like it or could not live with it and make that the middle name at the very least. I could never take away the name the child was given completely.     Myself, my biological parents named me Katie Jane, my adoptive parents loved Katie and Jane so they combined them into one word Katiejane, then added a middle name from my grandma.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	I know this makes me unpopular...but....    We adopted three children ages 4,5,6.  We debated this issue for a very long time.  In the end we decided to alter all of the children's names.    The eldest child we kept his first name and gave him my husband's name as his middle name.    The other two we moved their original names to the middle names and gave them new first names.    We talked to them about it, and told them we woudl still call them their original names, no problem.  They themselves decided to go by their new names.  Maybe they were just trying to please us, but if anyone tries to call them by their "old" names, they correct them vehmently.    We will be respectful as they grow, and remind them we can call them whatever they like.  We have all their old lifebooks and other and will never pretend that the names were not changed,,,,we are into opennedss and honesty.    For us and our kids, I think this really works for our family, but as they say time will tell and we shall see.  If it was a mistake, we will own up to it, but right now I can tell you they love having their new names, they lvoe the feeling that we are a part of that process, as well as their old mom names part of them too.  They have said this, that we are all one big family.  (hopefully first mom will be able to be in the picture at some point)    So that's it, bring on the thumb's down, but this is what we did, and we think this works.

zZH8Uizwaa	don't give up yet! still early. wait a few more days and then take another test.  continue with your normal cycle if your not pregnant.  if you don't want to do your temp, have you tried ovulation test strips?  a little expensive but they are a pretty good tool. it usually takes a month or two practice.  if your concerned you should check with your OB provider.|`|PQw92IGHaa	Day 1 of your cycle is always the day you start.  Ovulation occurs in the middle of your cycle, so if you are on a 34 day cycle then you should theoretically ovulate on Day 17.  If I were you I would start using the ovulation predictor kit (OPK) on Day 12 so that you can get a range, since you said it is give or take a few days :)  Good Luck!

Pf9fyEyQaa	With your due date tomorrow your baby is probably ready to thrive on the outside.  The natural ways of inducing labour only really work if your baby and body are ready.  I drink raspberry leaf tea a couple times a day (I'm only 35 weeks) but it's not to put me into labour.  I want to do my best to strengthen and tone my uterus (after all it is a muscle) so it can do it's best when the time comes.  Try walking.  My step mom walked a lot of stairs and the next day she went into labour, it's worth a try!  You can also have sex as semen contains a prosteglandin that helps to ripen the cervix.  You can ask your doctor to do a membrane sweep at your next visit which might help your body send those hormones to the uterus to start contracting.  There are also things like nipple stimulation that are supposed to help.  An induction is going to speed things up, wouldn't you rather speed things up naturally instead of having to do it medically?      Soon you'll be holding that beautiful baby in your hands! (hopefully sooner than later).  Good luck with the very end of your pregnancy!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	The end is in sight and I know that the last few weeks are HELL!!! That was my least favorite part of being pregnant. Sounds like he will be making his arrival into this world fairly soon though. Think of it like this, you have gone 40 weeks so far, you are strong enough to make it another week. I don't know if I would want to be induced on friday the 13th though!!lol|`|WcvsBgLuaa	My cousin was over a week past her due date before she had her son.  She just waited it out because in the end, she knew that there was going to be a beautiful baby in her arms.|`|CG5L6Fm6aa	Friday the 13th wow scary but i wish u luck and it be ok never got that far yet but... be excited :-)|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Have sex, then going walking in the mall. Also,I had a nurse tell me that if you rub your breasts, it sometimes causes the uterus to start contracting. Tell the doctor you don't want to have a friday the 13th baby. (-: It'll be over before you know it. Hang in there!|`|hS7wIapyaa	I admire you for toughing out so long. I went into labor a week early with my first and was induced two weeks early with my second. There are a few natural things you could try. Walking is usually at the top of the list, and it's harmless and good for you. Eating fresh pineapple could possibly get labor going. Having sex worked for 3 people I know, the semen relaxes the cervix or something like that. Then there are other things that would make you more uncomfortable if it doesn't work, like castor oil, if it doesn't work it will just give you diarrhea. But I do know two people that the castor oil worked for. Getting your feet rubbed could also bring on labor. Good luck and congratulations!
oXzHvsBpaa	less then 8 weeks. Most likely just an egg. Are you sure you don't mean cm? If its cm then between 12-13 weeks.    Pregnancy chart for fetal weight and length:  http://www.babycenter.com/average-fetal-...|`|780ByZVEaa	6 weeks|`|AA10015577	According to my book "Your Pregnancy-Week by Week" you are about 7-8 weeks pregnant, which means the baby is 5-6 weeks gestation.

T6nmD3X9aa	babies swim inutero!    they have videos not that show babies as young as 2-3 months swimming! Its amazing|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Those videos you see of babies swimming under water is done with professionals monitoring every second. You can't just take your baby, drop them in the pool and hope for the best.    I would suggest you just wait until your child is 3, old enough to understand instructions, and put them in a normal swim class.|`|iH2whFkHaa	From birth--it's instinctual.|`|y4uoDjV0aa	Well you can by 3, I did it.|`|djhCah5Maa	I heard that babies have a natural Instinct, and they know how to swim as soon as they are born.  I was only a few months old.  Maybe 4 months old?  I can't remember what my mother said.  She said all these women just threw the babies in the pool and they started to swim like little fish.  She was too afraid to throw me in.|`|5ca74cb9e6d3604c2c41d86d59b901beaa	from what i read, babies from the moment they are born have an instinct to automatically hold their breath..never personally had the chance to see my bella swimming around holding her breath but im not quite sure how much i want though.|`|5m74HzIWaa	Hi there, I just started doing swimming classes with my 5 month old, and on the first lesson they put there faces in the water briefly and after a couple of lessons I think they start to put them under completely ( only very briefly). The best way to get them accustomed to having water on their faces is to start in the bath at any age by counting to 3 then pouring a small amount of water over their  head(sit them up to do this). This way they learn to anticipate the water when you count to 3. It works, the first couple of times I did it he cried a little but now he closes his eyes and waits for it... he doesn't mind at all! Its all about getting them used to it slowly so that they don't fear it later on.|`|stUzx5VVaa	The "dive reflex" is a normal reflex that infants are born with.  Infant "swim" classes are less about swimming though, more about fun time in water with mommy and baby.
Zl3re1Vhaa	She's at that age where she feels like everybody else's opinion matters whether she knows their opinion or not she'll outgrow it eventually just talk to her and explain that you're comfortable with yourself and that's what matters|`|qPJPjrkNaa	She probably want's to show her friends that you have style.|`|QveBSjFSaa	Man, I hope you're kidding.  My niece once told her mother that she didn't want her taking her to or from school without makeup on.  My jaw hit the floor.... much like it has after reading this.  Have you put a lot of regulations on the way that she looks? Because that's the only thing that I can think of, t hat maybe you've expected her to look perfect when she's with  you, like showing her off type of thing, and now maybe the roles are reversed. Or, she is trying to appear cool to her friends, and needs you to look cool for her.  Either way,  know I would be devastated if my kids said this to me.  Have a good evening!|`|5NKwUZpVaa	She probably is embarrassed if you don't do these things. Girls often want to show off things to their friends, and you just happen to be around them a lot.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	She's probably at that age where the way you look can be embarrassing to her.|`|FiUprYsvaa	She is at that age where image matters.   She wants you to look good too....go along with it.
zsBViFcSaa	You might want to wait at least a week to take a pregnancy test, only because sometimes pregnancy tests may say you're not pregnant when you really are, since you took the test too early. But make sure you don't take too long, because if you are pregnant, you are going to need to take prenatal vitamins.     I hope I helped and good luck! =)|`|jNqf8HtDaa	take it a few days after when you would have your period. and you need to stay calm cause if you dont it could delay your period even more or could kill your baby if you are pregnant|`|0RFUKkBLaa	You caqn only take it about 2 days before your period is due if you take it before that it will more than likely come up negative as there wont be enough of the pregnancy hormone in your urine.|`|cCsN3tcZaa	you can try but it might not be clear so just try it.|`|jiFXPCyUaa	if you are pregnant, you are pregnant. so if you were to take a test, it will tell you. if it is negative, and you miss a period test again. I tested before (more than a week) my missed period. and found out i was pregnant. only "bad" thing about it is that now i feel i have longer to wait! lol|`|Mi0f4Hufaa	if you take a test, get a blood test done because it is probably too early to do a home test. but a couple a day before you are to expect your period get a home test but get one with BLUE response lines instead of pink, because the pink lines car be so light that you may miss the (+) results. (from my personal experience!) good luck!!!
AA10624857	When you went to Hawaii in November did all 4 of you go that time? If so, I'd ask your children how they liked the trip? If one of them is anxious to go back while the other one isn't, then I'd take the one who wants to go. I wouldn't tell them there is a chance for one to go, but just engage in a conversation. Some kids love that long plane ride there while others don't. If they both loved it, then I'd lean towards taking the 9 year old with me. No, it's not fair, but life isn't fair. There will be many things to come that they both won't be able to do. I'd just plan some special activities for the 5 year old to do with your fiance while you are away. There are some benefits to spending some one-on-one time with each of your children so I wouldn't pass up an opportunity to spend some time with one of my kids in Hawaii just because all my kids couldn't go. Later on, make arrangements to do something really special with your 5 year old just the 2 of you. I am mom to 4 and I've done things individually with each. It's a great bonding time plus gives the others time with their dad. It's not going to hurt for one of your kids to go with you when the other can't.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	hmmm ... tough call ... for me, i would take my younger one, because i just can't trust my husband with a younger child.  If my husband is responsible enough, I would take the older one, because he/she might understand and enjoy it more than the toddler.  But make sure you offer something fun for the non-going kid tho, like maybe a trip to an amusement park just you and him/her to make it sounds more "fair".|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	If it were me, I don't think I would accept the offer. I could not choose between my children. I don't think it would be fair. What does your fiance think?|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I would not take one and leave the other. If they both can't go, I would decline also.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	The 5 year old won't hardly remember it. I went to the Bahamas when i was 5, and when i was 12 and people talked about i had no idea what they were talking about. Take the 9 year old, or take your fiance and leave the kids with someone...but the 5 year old won't remember.|`|K24QQ2mlaa	why not just take your fiancee and have a family member to babysit the kid..|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	I would say thanks but no thanks on the grounds that it isn't fair to take one of the other.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Take the older one. The five year old won't mind. Just keep him or her with your husband and tell your husband to buy him or her some toys and to spoil him or her.|`|2xS1Jro7aa	Take the 9 year old and make the 5 year old excited by telling him how much fun him and daddy are going to have with just the two of them! Like another poster said your 5 year old will not even really remember it. Have lots of fun!!|`|mppKv11Eaa	Just don't choose. No parent should have to choose between their children. (I'm not a parent, but this is quite an obvious decision.)    OR! say yes and pay for the other child's ticket. I'd pick the older child for payment from my father, and pay for the younger child's ticket. MAKE SURE IT'S THE SAME FLIGHT!! It doesn't matter where they sit, most people will not mind taking your child's seat if you want to sit together (unless they are complete d-bags) If you live in the US eastern coast (Boston, MA), which I'm assuming you live in the continental US, and fly to Honolulu on American Airways on a round trip flight minus hotel and car rental, just the bare flight costs 762 USD. which, even with minimum wage (not saying you are payed it, but using it as a bare minimum for all intents and purposes), you can manage to scrounge up a bit more than that in the two booking months until May (you usually wanna book a flight two months in advance). Money will be tight, if it's a little more than your budget allowance, but is it not worth it? (BTW, this is for the entire month of May. You didn't say when she was getting married, so I just kinda encompassed the whole month.)     I used Expedia, which I think gets you some pretty good deals on flights, especially with American Airlines. And Boston is pretty far from Hawaii. Plus, If it is like, ten days or a week that you'll be staying there, the price is even cheaper. Usually, US Airways or American Airlines are the flights you're gonna want to take if your main concern is price.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Take the 9 year old.  The 5 year old won't really remember much of it a year from now anyway.  The 9 year old is old enough to remember the trip and wedding forever.

nrqWwQBXaa	it depends on the height and weight?|`|PoHpSqwwaa	I dont think it's age that matters , but  height|`|bZWbwyn4aa	In most states in Australia, I know it is until they are 10, not sure on the weight.  TO be honest, I have a 9  1/2 year old step-son, and he is too big for the seats, so we don't.  My son is 11, and he has been too big for them for a couple of years.    But the basic rule here is that if they still fit in the seats, you should keep them in them.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	It depends on what state you are in.  Call your local police department (non-emergency number of course).  They will be glad to tell you the state law on age/height/weight requirements for a booster seat.

Check out your state laws.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	1 Check your state law   2 in Michigan its 8 years old or 4'8inches.   3 Its safer to keep your kids in a booster seat as long as possible.|`|2xS1Jro7aa	This site might help!  http://www.carseat.org/Boosters/630.pdf|`|tkkYIdIvaa	It's made by weight but an average seven to eight year old should probably be the youngest.|`|fQ9MPAUpaa	we are all about saftey here, but I really don't think it's neccesary at age 8!

V6vAvs0Yaa	Oh teething. It was fun with my 5 year old, and my 5 month old is just getting started:    Your son does not set his bedtime, you do. The teething has little to do with his getting up. It does however explain his "random" fussiness during the day. If he gets up at around the same time every night (within say 30 minutes) its him and not his teeth.     When its lights out (ideally I'd say 7 to 8ish) turn off all the lights in his room (he doesn't need a night light, thats for your benefit). If he screams, let him scream. At least for a little while. When you do finally go in (and you will) go in quickly, without saying a word. Calm him down and leave as quick as possible. Also, change his feeding schedule to encourage him to sleep through the night.     My son has been sleeping through the night since 2 months. Its a small bit of luck, and a lot of hard lessons learned from my 5 year old. Its not too late for you to get a good nights sleep again.     And get rid of that orajel and pills rubbish. Your son needs cool, cold, and otherwise nice things to bite on. He'll sort out the problems himself.|`|SIhEme03aa	My daughter is 6 1/2 months old and she has two bottom teeth poking through. Needless to say, she's been miserable for the past week! For some reason, it doesn't seem to bother her until 4 in the afternoon and then she fusses straight through to bedtime. She's been going to bed about an hour later than usual (9:30 or 10). But once I get her down, she's still been sleeping through the night. I usually give her Orajel as soon as her gums start bothering her, and then again a few hours later. I've also been giving her Infant Tylenol right when she gets fussy. The Tylenol has only been used if her teeth are really bothering her, though. We haven't tried the teething tablets, because it seems like she does fine without them. The cool teething rings have worked really well. You can also try wetting a towel and freezing it. That seems to work too. Good Luck!

eGpOIV12aa	it really works. it worked wonders with my niece and nephew
Coc593Ikaa	I'm just sad that so many people fall for the headline. There is nothing surprising about his pregnancy. There is nothing all that impressive about it. There is no scientific breakthrough. This is just the first time that a woman had legall changed to a man and then decided to get pregnant.     I think it is shameful that the media makes more out of it than is there. I think that he and his wife are "fame whores". I think they are selling their story for everything it is worth ($$). I think it is sad that their children will be raised with such a spotlight on their familial issues.|`|AA11210211	What gives you the right to be pissed off,it has nothing to do with you personally??? I don't understand what all the fuss about it is???I don't really care it doesn't affect my life.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I was hoping this topic would have died down by now. It received far more press then it deserves. People born with ovaries and a uterus can have kids. It's nothing magical.    Instead of big media stories about a woman who willingly had her breasts removed and then got pregnant why don't we celebrate say, a breast cancer survivor who was forced to have her breasts removed and still managed to get pregnant.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I'm not pissed because honestly it's not my place to judge. Of course we all know that is not natural and very weird but if that is lifestyle he/she chooses to live, best of luck to them.    *I think what annoys people the most is when the media uses the term "Pregnant Man", when we all know the truth*.

She's 8 and would not understand did not know what to think about what she saw.    I wouldn't say that I'm pissed off...I just think that it puts questions out there for the young kids that aren't appropriate. Parents shouldn't have to be explaining to their 7 - 8 - 9 year old how a man could possibly get pregnant. That he was a woman and "changed" into a man but still had woman parts...It's just ridiculous.     I can understand that they wanted their own child, but that child is going to be a little disturbed that his/her "father" gave birth to them.|`|AA11609300	I just think it's weird, but whatever....|`|AA11459214	I agree SHE is a she until She has a penis so I wish they would stop calling her a man!|`|LDYAGJCxaa	I'm a supporter in the fact that it's her life and her body, so she can do as she pleases.

THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A PREGNANT MAN!|`|PC12QYoDaa	This is my opinion:    I didn't know he was a woman before, so that's even wierder. But before you told me the facts just now, I thought it was VERY wrong, and life wasn't intended to be created in a man's body. ugh! The things people try these days, to get money and attention. I'm just as mad at it as you are, it's just not right, and against the natural law! I mean people have free will and choose to do what they want, but I'm not gonna support something like that. So I agree with you!|`|6yy0jtzDaa	i agree she was born a woman and was a model for a while she is not a man she just looks like one isn't she having a another baby i don't hate her for wanting children and a family but i feel sorry for the children who will eventually find out by the press or parents that mommy is actually daddy with a homemade penis thanks to testosterone therefore they are both women making them dykes she should have had children while she still looked like a women and then became a man and no one would ever know you give your lifes up for your children she should realize that!|`|TScN3MHjaa	My man boobs dont produce milk|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	You know what...to each their own.

Its  simply a publicity stunt! And it pathetic because the only one it will honestly affect will be that poor child!!! I honestly feel sorry for the baby!     but that's my opinion and this is America and unfortunately no matter how much we disagree he/she has the right to bear a child no matter how unethical it is!|`|QYSsvqXyaa	Yes its all a marketing crap! He's a she end of story! There is no story there! SHE is just like the rest of us but with plastic surgery!|`|V7Q7SbHfaa	I think everyone should just leave them alone. There children are going to grow up with two loving parents which is a lot more then most of the child in america have.  I just don't think it is anyone else's business if you don't agree then don't watch their show.  Its 2009, there isn't one family that is "normal" anymore.  Everyone has their own problems and should just worry about themselves.|`|771454b5e041b041d8c1257a9a391ad9aa	I'm not pissed off but I just find it a little weird just because I don't really understand why someone would go through all the trouble of fufilling their wishes to become what they want to be, in her case a man and then she chose to get pregnant and be a woman for nine months. My impression of the couple is that they knew this would attract a significant amount of attention from the media and tv shows and are using it to their best advantage, milking it for all its worth. In this situation, the only people I feel sorry for is their children, who will have to live their lives uncomfartable under a magnifying glass and that everyone will know their "dad" is very very different. I can't help but feel that they would be tortured and traumatized throughout their lives in school and by others surrounding them. It only annoys me sometimes when they refer to her as a Pregnant Man which is creating a false message to people all around the World.     I know its wrong to judge other people but the only thing I have a hard time understanding is why she/he made the choice to have children now being transgendered and why not have her/his wife be the one to get pregnant. I guess the only way will ever know is if they both open up on why they decided this was the appropriate way for them to bring children into this world and not in the traditional nationally accepted way where a woman concieves a child and actually looks like a woman and obviously is a woman.     I would say that I don't support their decision mainly because of the effects that the negative exposure will have on their kids but if its what they wanted then it is what it is, its not like I can do anything about it they're are human just like us so just because of a choice they made they shouldn't be shunned just let them live their lives.    I hope this helps you.
MOsStEbqaa	It sounds like you could be and a test is the only way to know for sure. Good luck.       Also take the test asap in the morning. First morning urine is always the best.|`|cCsN3tcZaa	Just get tested. so you can be sure..
WbJPQM1naa	I have seven children, including twins.  I have breastfed them all.  I wouldn't have made any other choice for feeding my children.      Some women do have pain when breastfeeding.  It depends upon how sensitive they are.  One way to be prepared is to pinch the nipples throughout pregnancy in order to get used to the feeling.  Also, some women experience pain because they haven't learned how to have the baby latch on completely.  So, they might need to find a lactation consultant to help them get used to it.  Usually, after regular feeding, the pain goes away because you're used to the feeling of baby suckling.    I found breastfeeding very relaxing and a wonderful bonding experience with my child.  I wouldn't say it was "sexy" or had anything sexual in it!  Breasts were meant for feeding the young, NOT for sexual stimulation.  And I NEVER found anything sexual in feeding my children.  I was mothering in the most natural way.  The reason it was relaxing is because, as you feed, certain hormones are released in the mother's body. These are hormones with serve to calm and relax us.  It is natural way to help mom slow down and calmly sit and take care of baby's needs.    Breastfeeding feels very satisfying and wonderful, holding your baby close, and enjoying the fact that nature serves up the best possible food for your baby without any effort on your part!  NO bottles to wash, no screaming baby waiting for you to prepare a bottle, and little worry about the food causing your baby constipation or allergic reations.  You can feed your baby anywhere, regardless of your access to clean water.  So, for me, breastfeeding was a no brainer, BEST decision!  Even for my twins!    Good luck and hope you might decide to do so in the future.  R|`|TScN3MHjaa	You can suck on my man boob, and i will tell you if i feel sexy or not. i have 2 man|`|cBjWkcm0aa	thats creepy|`|69uizI7Naa	You can take classes for breast feeding, to make sure you get a good latch and the baby is getting good milk flow.... most hospitals offer programs... Also there is the well known "La Leche League" that helps with breast feeding - their web site is:     http://www.lllc.ca/    And as a mother who breastfed - LOL it's not a sexual thing at all.... women worry about it being sexual and how they will deal with it.... Something takes over you when you have a baby and it becomes non-sexual and sedating.... It becomes natural and relaxing, a bonding time with your baby.... You'll be looking at him/her and their tiny fingers on your breast, their little eyes closed/ or looking up at you... It becomes a wonderful exprience between the two of you... It was for me and my friends with children....    It only hurts if your baby isn't latching properly and not getting enough milk, and your breasts become engorged... Regular feeding and proper latching should make it pain free... Also womens nipples have natural oil for lubrication - when the baby suckles the oil is worn off and after your feedings you should get special non-toxic cream to apply to your nipple - otherwise they may get dry and crack in which case it will hurt... So all my friends got cream in their baby shower gifts and a little note that said "here's something that you never knew you needed" LOL  ;-)    P.S.  Anyone who says breastfeeding is SEXY - hasn't gotten up at 12pm, 2 am, 4 am breast feedings.... LOL|`|UUIqK50Taa	That is sooooo wrong! Your friend is weird--breastfeeding is not supposed to be sexy--it's supposed to provide food for the baby. Your friend is gonna be a child molester.|`|A89ezcg5aa	Yes, in the begining it hurts and sometimes bleeds at first.  It does not make you feel sexy at all.  After I was used to it, it made me get a cuddly, nurturing feeling inside, but that's it.|`|rIOD8tgvaa	Oh, my gosh.  Are you real?  Engorged breasts are painful.  Your nipples can bleed.  You must be dedicated and truly committed to breastfeeding to make it work.  Guess what?  Educated females who are informed make the decision and the poor for different reasons of course.  I have heard of women who breastfeed and have an orgasm but, you know...never happened to me.  I literally breastfed all my kids for ten years.  It is called infant and tandem breastfeeding.  Go to a website by Le Leache organization.  They are all about information on breastfeeding.  Not only do you increase your child's IQ you also help them defend themselves against illness.  Children who use no pacifiers have straighter teeth and their teeth come better due to the sucking instinct.  Gosh, how lame.  Everything is not about sex.  Find an outlet for yourself will you?  Breastfeeding is for moms not perverts.|`|EP0cAEo7aa	Haha I guess if your boyfriend/husband does it to you it is, but I don't think a baby would give you the same feeling :)|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	I wouldn't think a baby suckling you teat is sexy. Don't listen to her. They pinch, grab and have a tendency of pulling your hair. Hardly sexy.|`|NlaVawVhaa	Cool and sexy feeling? Cool to give your child the best that nature has to offer. Sexy? Really? Breastfeeding is not sexual in nature. It does hurt at first. After that, besides an overwhelming feeling of love for your baby, it feels natural. If the baby is a good breastfeeder you barely notice.
VS8mactUaa	He is probably a man that feels akward having sex with a woman like 9 months prenant, as well he just got laid off, he could be depressed, he is about to bring a baby into the world with no job, hes stressed and probably feels worthless. Men like to provide for us, well real ones anyway, maybe he feels like hes failing, take it easy on him, pregnancy and babies ae just as tough on the men as they are us.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	He might just be depressed and worried. With him being laid off and you having a baby, he might just need some time to collect himself. I would say, after all this time passes with his job and whatnot, and he is still doing this, than I would be concerned then. At that point, you might need to seek some sort of couseling together.|`|0vQsoYIbaa	It's hereditary.  Men are kind of hard-wired to think about other things when their woman is pregnant.  Sex is humans' most imperfect mechanism.|`|DzGKfdKnaa	Wow you got sex once a month during the last moths of your pregnancy?|`|xOr67VDiaa	im 25 and my husband is 30, and he doesnt want to do it with me either lol i actually said to him last night, we should try and do it lol he said yeah and went to sleep LOL i dont know what it is about them, and i also think to myself how can they go so long without doing it! for some reason i think its their symptoms of pregnancy, he knows he cant hurt the baby and he also knows i want to do it, but it doesnt help lol. i think its just them..after my 3rd he wanted to do it so bad but i wouldnt do it cos i had my period for 6 weeks and he was going nuts lol idk its so weird, and its like were horny crazy pregnant woman lol we just want the love! but cos he had lost his job and all that maybe he is feeling down ( sex should make him feel good) but so many men are different, maybe he is to embarrassed to tell you he think it will hurt the baby!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i think they think the baby will see or it wil hurt something men are moody dont let them tell you we are the ones lol   enjoy yourself and to heck with him|`|dc460f6168bc2ee3d4ab9b2e847777e0aa	Red Bull or amphetamines|`|rFMRgHTdaa	When i was pregnant my boyfriend had a problem similar to this. He didn't think he could hurt the baby but he was bothered a little because when we would have sex the baby would move and since he has never felt that it was hard for him to get use to it. Just ask him why tell him you don't believe he is tired so he needs to express himself to you.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	well your almost done with the pregnancy mine was the other way around he never wanted sex just on the days i could get preggo and now that i am he wants to all the time b/c it feels good or whatever try when you go to bed to start rubbing on him and get him so turned on he cant help it and he will want to do it lol    trick him is the key to getting it|`|7cvoxQitaa	He could be feeling awkward. You are carrying his baby!! His thingy is like inches from his child's head!!! He probably doesn't want to admit that he's getting that feeling, guy pride thing. Let him off the hook, at least for a week longer! There are always other ways... like self pleasure.. I know not as fun, but still a way to help induce labor!|`|TGlWnFjxaa	many men get like this... they deny its not hurting the baby but usually thats the first thing that goes through their head... Wait til you have the baby and see if things change.. If not remember there's always the lovely couch you can put him on LOL. Kidding.    Hope this helps....|`|33l3blvsaa	ok hunny, i dont mean to be blunt but its probley because he just isnt turned on by the fact that your pregnant.. ALOT of guys are like this!! my fiance was like this when i was pregnant we have a honest relationship & he just told me straight "i love you but im not turned on atm" but after you have bubby!!! hehe sex is AMAAZZIINNGG again:)|`|yIC6I9wHaa	my husband was the same way until i asked him and he said im scared to hurt you or the baby but we went in the web to let HIM see that it was safe maybe hes the same or just worry about his job and stressed out|`|AA11820380	I'm in the same situation. I'm 21 weeks and we haven't had sex since I found out I was pregnant. He doesn't wanna hurt the baby and I completely understand that. Maybe he just feels weird having sex knowing the baby is bigger. A lot of men feel weird about it, it's a man thing. Don't feel the way you're feeling. He may say that, that is not the reason, but believe me honey he's not tired, he just feels weird.|`|n44vDRQTaa	Maybe hes scared of the fact that hes due to become a father he feels depressed by the fact hes not working. Have you spoken to him and asked him why?|`|ahjOfnIIaa	Hey Sweetie , I understand it's frustrating in this kind of situation, but I think the problem is not with you. I don't beleive that it's because he isn't interested or doesn't love you, but having sex with your signifigant other when she's pregnant REALLY scares the crap outta men, I don't know why, but it does. I have talked to doctors before about it and they all say the same thing, that pregnancy makes guys get nervous and scared and weirded out....have you ever watched Knocked Up? IT's such a great movie when you're expecting and it will help you see maybe a bit of how he is feeling about this perticular part of your relationship. Good luck Sweetie, xo|`|eD0MVJxUaa	I feel your pain.  When my husband gets stressed out, he doesn't want sex either.  I never understood because I always heard it was a great way for guys to unwind and relieve some of that stress.  Since he lost his job I would assume he is the same as my husband.  He must be stressed out.  His mind might be on how he is going to support a baby with no job.  Good Luck!|`|cyTlkoAYaa	I have the same Problem, I am almost 26 weeks along and I think that we have sex maybe once every 2 weeks or less, He says that he doesn't want to or ignores me, My husband also doesn't have a job, and he is already a father so I don't see what his problem is.  And its not like im that big Im only 128 Lbs and it only looks like a ball is under my shirt, Im not sure maybe its just the male mind at work.|`|17lkwekHaa	maybe he is just depressed from being laid off from his job.  So yea, plus he might not want 2 hurt u guys baby, plus its' good so u 2 wont get tired of sex and u will enjoy it more, when u haven't had it 4 a while.      Good luck sweetie.|`|XjHXgGU2aa	Im going through the same thing. My husband stopped having sex a few months ago. At first I thought that it was because I was getting bigger but then he told me that it makes him self conscious as he thinks he would hurt the baby. I'm also just 4 days away from my due date and my doc has recommended sex to bring on labor...however, now Im so uncomfortable that even the idea of having sex makes me want to puke. I hope labor comes on its own.     I think your fiancee is probably feeling a bit insecure since he's been laid off...keep trying talking to him as Im sure with the coming baby he's feeling stressed about finances. Tell him that he's not in this alone and that things would work out once the baby comes. I wish you all the best!
pz1OdJoPaa	No she will be able to do this naturally herself.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	What?   Why would you clean your baby's mouth at all?  How odd!|`|MjashZnvaa	No.. the only time you need to worry about it is if she has thrush. Did her Dr tell you to clean her gums and tongue? Ive never heard of doing that.. If she gets thrush (basically a yeast infection in her mouth) then she will need to see a Dr. If its that she will have white stuff in her mouth, and possibly lips that wont wipe off.|`|3gDiRoNwaa	Yes it is because they can get thrush or thrash which is very painful for a babytheirr tongue will get a lot of milk build up on it and it hurts them and they will not be able to drinkther milk as easily as they usually do. after i would fed my babies i would always wipe out there mouths with a warm damp rag and cuz usually after you feed them they will go to sleep so i would just wipe out there mouths and at night for they go tosleepp make sure you wipe out the mouth good because the build up of the milkcana mess up there teethbeforet hey even get any.|`|ta8pa4o1aa	personally id say no...   ive never heard of this practise, nor or even cleaning a babys gums etc...theres no need to do this till they teeth, unless as already stated the baby has an oral thrush infection.    i never done this with any of my children and their mouths, gums and teeth are just fine!
VS8mactUaa	It when your skin has lets say a yellow sheen to it, theres nothing to worry about tho, Just relax and directly ask your doctor to help calm the nerves.|`|AA11609972	Its quite common in newborn babies,can be treated by lphototherapy if severe,Jaundice is caused by the liver not being fully developed and not yet fully functioning properly,it is more common in boys than girls and is nothing to worry about.|`|QYSsvqXyaa	Look It up... It's Yellowing of the skin.|`|62c46c155ac9129ababc1c13d11b511eaa	every baby born gets skin jaundice it is no way serious.|`|fbZ2kYoHaa	Jaundice is actually a symptom. In most cases jaundice is harmless in newborns, but sometimes they need a special blanket at home with lights or if it is high enough they need to be admitted to the hospital to be in an incubator with stronger lights. It usually lasts for only a few days.      Jaundice is caused by a buildup of a broken down blood product (bilirubin).  Normally the liver breaks it down a different way so that it can be excreted in the poop. The more they feed the more they poop which helps rid of the build up of newborn bilirubin.    If you are concerned that she is yellow then the doctor may want to test the bilirubin.
PZ44zMWAaa	I would call the doctor and try to get in as soon as possible.  Let the dr. know everything you posted on here.  You probably should take a test to see if you are or were pregnant.  A pregnancy test should still show positive.  I had a m/c in October last year and the test showed positive for about a month after wards.  If you test positive, you definitely need to see the doctor.  Good luck.|`|S1AuL4SOaa	When I was pregnant with my daughter I also thought I was having a period. It came at the exact same time and lasted the same ammount of days. The only difference was it was lighter than normal. I tested a week after my "period" and it was positive! The pregnancy was completely normal.  My doctor told me that sometimes womens body's have a "mock period" for a few months.|`|q5MGxuyaaa	You might have had a chemical pregnancy or early miscarriage.  The only way to know would have been if you had taken a pregnancy test and gotten a positive.  I would still take a test, just to be sure.  If your period continues to act weird, go see a doctor.  Goodluck!!|`|O810hUs2aa	it sounds like you had a miscarriage sorry i sorta have the same thing and miscarried
6yy0jtzDaa	it could just be the heat getting to you and actually standing for a long period of time or trying to wash down there with a big belly your circulation increases by like 40% so all that extra blood moving around prolly makes it hard to concentrate sometimes|`|4KT1cXMBaa	Maybe you should do what the fist person said, and plus the baby like a week away!   Good luck!|`|DzGKfdKnaa	I had this symptom when I was diagnosed with preeclampsia. Pregnancy hypertension. See doctor, it can cause seizures if you have this.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	take a warm bath instead and take your time getting out of the bath so you wont be standing so much|`|0RFUKkBLaa	I always see stars when i get a shower n get quite dizzy but i think its because of the heat. Ive been like this since i was 3 months pregnant. dont like the feeling ive seen me a couple of times having to get out and ly on the floor to let it pass lol sounds funny but it is a scary feeling and my blood pressure is fine. Id say its nothing to worry about. As soon as i put the shower a bit cooler since ive been fine.|`|AA10780655	Im almost 37 weeks and the same thing happens to me sometimes  I'll see like sparkly little squiggles  And right after I'll rush to take my BP(I have a home monitor) and its always normal  I told the doctor about it, and he said since my blood pressure is always normal its nothing to worry about  I really dont know what causes it, maybe its just another joy of pregnancy|`|xOr67VDiaa	its normal, its like little black dots that just go around everywhere, i think it has to do with how you get up  to quick or move to fast from doing one thing to another, try not to have a hot hot shower..it happens to me alot, im not sure cos my bp is good too and everything else every time i see the doctor, im 36 weeks and it started around 35 weeks, i really think you need to just take things a bit slower ( not that i can talk lol) i think its similar to how we move to quick and feel like we have torn a muscle or something, or stretch the wrong part. ive fainted once this pregnancy and have no idea why, just take it easy and make sure you keep your fluids up, YAY NOT LONG GOOD LUCK!!!|`|9wbsjbioaa	chemical off balance somewhere, dont worry about it  you should equal out in a couple weeks anyway|`|uWOwz5rvaa	It may be that you are not drinking enough water or getting enough iron. Since you are pregnant though, I would def. bring this up at your next doctor's appointment. I get dizzy sometimes when I step out of the shower and feel as though I am going to pass out, usually when I take a really hot shower though, so maybe have a little less hot water.|`|n44vDRQTaa	please please please seek help. it could be a sign of pre-eclampsia. My sister had flashing in her eyes and it was only when she passed out that she got help. Get it checked by the midwife so they can rule that out. good luck|`|yIC6I9wHaa	that happened with me too just drink something cold or hot and rest on your left side and don't get up until ur ok make sure u tell ur doc k and congrats at cafemom.com u can talk to other pregnant woman that can give you more advice
2TrHH0rkaa	Boss is just a weird name. If you insist on using it, use it as a middle name. Levi or Aiden Boss would sound nice although I prefer Levi as it's less common.    Suri automatically makes me think Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise. What about Faith Suri?|`|ej51eWO7aa	Suri Faith & y would you name your son boss?|`|puVdvis2aa	ummm... personaly, i dont favor any of them, but if i had to choose between them i would choose: Boss Aiden Bower and Suri Faith Bower    boss isnt my favorite name, but all that matters is if you like it lol!    good luck!|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I dont like Boss at all how about Aiden Levi or Levi Aiden?    and Suri Faith for a girl|`|TS55G97faa	Boss?    Suri Faith.
9vgZNLP8aa	Honestly, I wouldn't do the root canal I would just pull the tooth. I have never heard of a single root canal that lasted. They are expensive and VERY painful.|`|NysFTExhaa	You can take any opiates that are mixed with Tylenol (like percocet).  There will be people on here who disagree and give me thumbs down for saying that but it's cat. B-C (depending on the type you're given) for pregnancy and I have been on it while pregnant and was prescribed it by my OBGYN.  I had him quote me from a medical book that it was safe to take before I accepted the prescription.    If you're uneasy taking something so strong, extra strength Tylenol is safe.|`|t6OGh0Edaa	I had one done at about 20 weeks and my doc put me on Amoxicillin because mine ended up infected and then Tylenol 3 which both my dentist and doc said were totally safe during pregnancy.  Good luck! Hope this helps!|`|AA11763588	I had to get a wisdom tooth pulled when I was 8 months. My Dentist faxed over a form or all the meds she wanted to use and give me afterwards. My DR faxed back what I could and could not take.    They weren't allowed to numb me, but I was able to get something for the pain afterwards.|`|gyoylefvaa	NOPE.|`|9yeyzQi5aa	Your at the safest time in your pregnancy to get this done. With pain the most they will likely do is Tylenol extra strength. But trust me i has to get a bad cavity filled at 23 weeks and it works really good and is completely safe to the baby...good luck :)|`|xeS8pUfbaa	percoset vicodin tylenol3 and morphine are all safe. that's what i have been given for pain so far this pregnancy|`|6yy0jtzDaa	i did and mine hurt like hell but i took tylenol and just rested after wards  i was given tylenol 3 but i didn't take it because any kind of pain medication like that makes me sick to my stomach i just used ambesol which is safe it helped loads hope it all works for you     the same thing happened to me i had a bad cavity at 6 weeks along i had to go back at 8 weeks along because my nerve was exposed and it was killing me and finally at 12 weeks when i went back my temp filling had fell  out and  my tooth broke in HALF! they could start the root canal he did some work and gave a me a temp filling again to see if my tooth would hold up and eventually he finished the root canal and built on to my tooth that had broken in half my gums are very sensitive and i hate shots which i had to get every time!|`|TGlWnFjxaa	Let your dentist know your pregnant.. to be honest your going to have to go with the pain...I had a root canal done 2 years and my crown fell of and I was in pain. I had a special root canal done when i was pregnant and they couldn't numb me  or anything. They had to contact my provider and ask if i can take a certain medication and my provider said I couldn't but she saw me to give me meds i could take. (really doesn't help either since they are low dosage) I was watch closely since the dentist pulled out black cotton that the previous dentist left in there. My mouth was infected and I was restricted on meds...

nBlSS6HUaa	I had a MC 11-12-08, natural I was about 6 weeks. My hCG wasn't doubeling. Then I had another MC 12-12-08, natural. Then I had my period 1-6-09 and it lasted till 1-10-09. I was due for my period 2-2-09, and didn't get it, took a test and it was neg. Then yesterday I called my DR and he wants to see me today, because of my history with Miscarriages. WELL...I started this morning! 4 days late! So now he wants me to wait till Tuesday (when my period will be over) that way he can run some tests.   If you are pregnant...you probably won't get a positive result till your atleast 5 weeks pregnant according to most hpts. I also read that on babycenter.com And it is very common for your 2nd period after a MC to take longer. Due to stress.   Good Luck! I know how you feel right now! I ended up crying myself to sleep this morning because I thought for sure I was pregnant! We've been TTC since April 2008.|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	the first person that said " if u are spotting your not pregnant" is not right at all.

Just call your dr office and ask their advice.|`|O7TafEUoaa	I had a m/c in August 2008 and it took me until December to get back on track...including a one month boost on Progesterone for 10 days in October to "force" AF to come.

8Qxb7OZOaa	Nothing good especially when its obviously intentional.  It can be misinterpreted as shame which effects the achild self esteem and self worth.    My biological family (relatives) come in many ethnicity's and religions(non religions).      We naturally embraced it and it has never been a serious issue although there have been plenty of jokes/comments amongst us.    Ex.  I (non hispanic) speak better spanish than my cuban, puerto rican and dominican nephews and nieces.  Their paternal families always point that out to them to try encourage them to become more fluent.      Differences are acknowledged just like similarities. How can they not be.......we are all different in one aspect or another.      To deny or ignore the differences would be delusional and very confusing to say the least.|`|vwTyihvvaa	I think no good comes from being "colour blind". I think any adoptive parent should embrace their adoptive child's colour, race, etc. That an adoptive parent should acknowledge that there is a difference, that you are Asian, Black, etc. whatever the race might be, but that will still love you.     I also think it is very important for adoptive families to embrace the culture, hertiage, etc. of their adoptive child, even if there are caucasian, I am of different heritage roots then my adoptive family and I have been allowed to embrace that I am German, not Scottish/Welsh as my adoptive family is.     Yes, racism should be out of the question of course, but no adoptive parent should deny their adoptive children's culture, roots, etc.|`|YkSPMvg5aa	All parents are blinded by love of their children and she's not being intentionally hurtful...maybe just a wee bit in denial which in itself is hurtful.  But depending on her age--that was the generation of my parents too. My parents are the king and queen of we ignore it or don't talk about it--there are no issues to exist.     I asked a question sim but from a different perspective a while back....and YES racism is alive and well--and probably more awful in some ways.|`|DmJFln79aa	Excellent point.  Our child is bi-racial and we honestly don't see it.  I never realized that our 'not seeing it' might be viewed as denying his difference.  We are sincerely not denying any differences, just that we see him as our child, not a race.  When he's older, I would never ignore any differences when, and if he wants to address it.    Thanks for pointing out what it might feel like from your angle, when parents don't 'see color'.|`|4rGmbOnUaa	Individuality is the key to making us who we are.  If we all are the same and no one sees are differences, then what's the point of peace?  What's the point of life?  There is nothing wrong with different races.  I don't think your a mom was trying to judge you but she was saying it in more of a way like "you are a part of our family, and you are a "insert last name here" instead of being like oh you aren't in this family.|`|zVO37WUQaa	It's a real simple answer. Love knows no color.you love them as if you were blood. White black yellow its makes no difference,|`|6orvPrLLaa	color-blindness helps the psyche of people who wish to deny that racism exists; and to deny the culture of the "blindee"|`|S5Lsbh0taa	Political correctness...    Well thats how I see colourblind in the way your talking about as being. You are still who you are, and somethings political correctness can't change. (No matter how much they try.)    I got a book called "I don't have your eyes." (The follow on line is "But I have your way of looking at things...") to read to my girls to start the process of talking about adoption with them as they grow up. I felt it didn't deny we don't look the same but we can still have things in common like interests.     It is wrong to deny a person who they really are both inside and outside.     That's what gets to me when people say they have to 'westernize' names to be accepted by other kids. Isn't that a form of denial too. To be accepted your name has something like "Mark" "Emma".    I know Asian kids and even African kids that are keeping their true names more and more because they have finally developed a sense of pride in who they are. (None of the recent African migrants in my suburb, which there has been a lot over the past ten years that I've met went and changed their name to satisfy our culture or ideas on whats 'normal' to name a child.... Okay Starjump is taking to far, but then that's not really a name is it. But then I'd just shorten it to Star.)     That's just one part, not the whole picture. It's okay to disagree with your parents if you think they're off the mark a little. I'd rather my kids were honest with me and talk to me if they felt something was out of line ( like what your amother said "she once told me our eyes are "the same".)  then let it fester for ten years and have it turn into resentment or become more than it should be.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	Sounds like her heart is in the right place.  She doesn't see you as different because she loves you.  By pointing out the differences she may be afraid of making you feel like an outsider, a stranger in your own reality.    As others have mentioned, the world has revolved around the sun a few times and views have changed.  What was once ignored in the hope of instilling security in a child is now something acknowledged and embraced.  Your mom may not have caught up yet with the latest thinking about transracial adoption.    We are all a product of our times and the older we get, the harder it is to teach us old dogs new tricks.|`|7PNbjit0aa	I think a lot depends on the individuals definition of color blind.  If you mean color blind in the sense of seeing all people as equals, with unique similarities and differences that should be shared and appreciated, fantastic.    If you define color blind as all people are the same, ethnicity means nothing and has no bearing whatsoever, you're going to have problems.|`|2f49jsLpaa	We adopted both of our children from Korea, and I agree that being "color blind" and pretending there are no differences can cause a lot of unintentional harm to children adopted transracially.     While we were open to adopting a child of any race, and we knew that race would not matter as far as loving our children was concerned, we also feel strongly that it was important to help our children be proud of their heritage and who they are. We want them to know that they are beautiful just the way they are, and we don't want them to think that we wish they looked more like us by pretending that they do.|`|GFzjkhS0aa	First off, I appreciate the effort your mother is making. She is doing her best, and, as you know, she has good intentions. Being "colorblind" used to be a popular idea, but today it is considered outdated. Today the best thing to do is acknowledge our differences and see them as STRENGTHS! Diversity is wonderful. If you want, you should research your culture on your own, and be proud of it, without ever putting any other culture down, as I am sure you know! Appreciation, not denial! :)|`|zLoyo24Taa	Perhaps when your amom said you have the same eyes, she meant you see the same things. She may not have meant your eyes look the same.    I think we all see in color and we should celebrate the different things everyone brings to the family.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Nothing.    I think that's a holdover from civil rights days, for most of us, the generation of our parents.      Race does exist, race is still an issue for society at large and adoptive parents aren't doing their children any favors by simply refusing to talk about it.      Parental love may be colorblind, but society surely isn't.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Being different is what makes us all unique in this world and I don't have a problem of it.  I'm well aware, as are my children, that my wife and I are white and that they are either white, East Indian or First Nations.  We all know who and what each other is in that regard but at the same time we have all gained a greater appreciation for our differences as well as our similarities.      When I say that race doesn't matter to any of us, it certainly doesn't.  My middle daughter does not describe her older sister as being her "Indian sister" or her "adopted sister".  My oldest doesn't refer to the baby as her "native sister" or anything else.      Yes, racism is a part of the world and a part of the world that we need to one day eliminate if we can.  At the same time however that change has to start somewhere and I know that it has started not only in my family but in others as well.      A few years ago my daughter was having a problem with another kid at school.  I was there one day to pick her up and asked who it was that was causing her grief.  She pointed to a group of kids and said that she was the one with the black hair.  Well, a couple of kids had dark hair but it turns out, after a few additional questions, that it was the child with not only black hair but very dark (black) skin as well.  For my daughter it wasn't the colour of her skin that she noticed or chose to use as a descriptor of someone (as most others would be prone to do) but the colour of her hair.    Everyone has racist tendencies in some aspect of their lives but I've seen, not only with my children but with others from mixed race families (adopted or natural) that there can be less tendencies in cases where people are raised together.  We can all still celebrate our differences and be proud of them but we don't need to be defined by them or limited by them.
zqfs7A6Caa	You say that he just screams when you try to have him sit on the potty? Although you should never punish him for accidents, if he refuses to sit on the potty when you tell him, that is defiance and requires discipline.    First of all, do not worry about teaching him to pee standing up. Our son is three and fully potty trained, but still takes off his pants and underwear entirely to go. He also sits down to pee or poop. He sometimes tries to stand up, but we are discouraging it until he is four or five because it just makes a mess.    Put him in underwear except at night. If he has an accident, make him get on the potty for a few minutes. Then have him help you clean the mess. Act disappointed but not angry.      Make him sit on the potty for about 5 minutes. If he refuses to sit (or screams) spank his butt and make him sit. He will soon start sitting when he is told. Do this every hour or so until he goes. When he goes, stick with the reward system that you have already established plus offer lots of praise.    The main thing is to get him to sit on the potty when you tell him. You will be able to see the signs that he is trying to poop. If he tries to hide in order to poop (or pee), than treat that as another discipline issue. It is one thing if he is distracted or unable to tell he has to go, but if he willfully goes in his pants when he knows he is supposed to use the potty,that is disobedience.    Eventually he will tell you when he has to go. When he does, offer lots of specific praise. Not just, "good job going potty" but rather, "good job telling us you had to go potty."|`|lqSMkDNkaa	Take a 2 or 3 day weekend to stay home with him, do not leave the house.  Wake up the first day and tell him that today is the first day we are going to really make you a big boy.  Set him down with a potty video or potty books and give him plenty of fluids.  Meanwhile, set a kitchen timer for 30 minutes (or 20) and every time the timer goes off you get really excited and say "its time to try and go potty, yay!"  If goes  1 give him an m&m and praise him, if he goes   2, give 2 m&m's.  If he at least tries to do either then give him a sticker to put down on a potty chart (Poster board chart you can make).  The key is to stay consistent like this for at least 2 days and eventually every time that timer goes off every half hour he will give in.  Stay posistive and don't give up, good luck!|`|m8KDIjzEaa	My son went through this. It was a nightmare for us and him. I was pregnant during the entire struggle. After the baby I kept telling him to be the "Big Brother" that didn't work either. I let him help me change a diaper on his new brother and he got squirted. It was sad and funny at the same time. He was so upset. He never wore a diaper again.  I think what really ended up helping him was letting him pee outside a few times or peeing with Daddy and seeing how a big boy pees. He loved peeing on the tires of my husbands truck..lol.       Oh and when Camo would go pee I wouldn't reward him unless he went a whole day without an accident. 3 year olds understand the concept of time and I would tell him, when we wake up the pull up comes off, we pee in the toilet all day until the sun goes to bed and then I would reward him.    Good luck! I know how difficult it can be. He'll get the hang of it.|`|iFmKcRl0aa	Little boys have their own timetable, that's for sure.    We're on about month 8 with our three-year-old as well, but he's finally taking himself to the potty now. We just kept having a huge celebration and cheered for him every time there was a success. Pretty soon, he became eager to please.    We also explained to him the difference between wet and dry. You can reinforce this by letting him know when you put on dry underwear or a dry Pull-up (or whatever you're using), "This is dry. Dry is good!" And after an accident, "Oh no, this is wet."     I felt like I got the best results by just letting him run around in his underwear. For him, I think the fact that his pants absorbed moisture if he "dribbled" kept him from paying attention and realizing that he was either wet already or needed to go.     There are some pretty good resources here about potty training if you want more help.  http://www.findingdulcinea.com/guides.to...|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	He'll get it eventually. My god will be 4 in August, and he's just starting to get the hang of it (and by starting I mean occasionally).    Kids do things in their own time.     But a trick a friend of mine is trying is when her son poops in his diaper, she takes it off, walks him to the bathroom and has him dump his poop it the toilet and gets him to flush. He's still a way off from being trained (he's 1 1/2) but he's understanding that the toilet is for poop.|`|AA10593735	My friend taught me about this, maybe it will work for you:  On a day that you will be home all day, take a timer and set it for every 10 minutes.  Tell him when the timer goes off he has to try to use the potty whether he needs to go or not.  Once he's off the potty, reset the timer for another ten minutes.  Repeat.      It worked really well for me.  My oldest was totally potty trained in 2 days using this method.  Good Luck!|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	My son, very bright, good communicator, didn't start wearing underwear and using the toilet full time (except for at night while sleeping) until 4. Same with my daughter. A child who is unaware of his/her need to go to the bathroom is incapable of being potty trained. Don't pull your hair out, don't bow to peer pressure or the feeling that you're inadequate, take a deep breath, you've done the best you can do. You can create all the incentives you want (and those do have a positive effect even if you don't see it now, strangely enough) but until he is aware, he is not capable.     Lots of people will give you advice, and sometimes the pressure comes from parents and relatives and best friends. Try not to take it personally, everyone has an opinion. I think too often we set expectations according to our own needs and not to the needs and rhythm of the child (I'm really not a hippy-dippy parent, it's just that this, too, shall pass.)     Keep trying, bring it up, be encouraging, even pick up some kids' books that talk about potty training. Keep the issue alive, but keep your expectations in check. Patience is the key. Don't pull out your hair, your child is not abnormal just because he isn't using the potty yet. (And in my experience, Huggies Pull-Ups are the best, most absorbent training pants, although they are also the most expensive. They have the absorption of regular diapers unlike the Pampers brand and all of the other generic brands that I tried.)|`|VoV7jGc3aa	I have a 41/2 year old step son that was also slow with potty training. I honestly think that they do it when they are ready and that is that. Alot  of people told us not to worry and that boys usually take longer to potty train than girls, but it was still a little frustrating.     What we tried when he was learning was to reward him with "big" boy stuff, like making a big deal about buying "big" boy underwear or doing something special (like a trip to the park or something that you don't do everyday) with him when he doesn't have an accident for a whole day. Also if you schedule allows it, you could try to put him on the potty every hour or so and be really enthusiastic about trying to use the potty like a big boy.     Good luck, I'm sure that he'll get the hang of it soon!
AA10494763	As a former dog owner i don't think so.  I always wanted a dog growing up and my mother would not let me. We had cats but she said dogs were to much work.  Well i got a dog and you know what they are to much work.  I lasted six months but it was tough and i realized that dog owner ship is not for me. I got books and thought i could handle it. I did not know before that i could not handle it. I really wanted a dog and thought i could do it.   Also some people are given dogs and have to give them up. My aunt bought me a golden retriever puppy because she knew i wanted a dog. My mother would not even let it come through the door. I assume some parents cave even though they did not want it because grandma or someone bought it then they turn around and give the puppy up.     Now my kids won't get one either because we all know that if the kids get a dog it is really the parents that take care of it.   Maybe when they are adults they will have better luck.   I did not sell my dog though I took it to a shelter which is were i got her from|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Yes, they should have known but life is messy and things happen. Does that make it right, no probably not.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	The cuteness wears off.  The adopters didn't form an attachment to their gift. The humane society discourages giving pets as gifts for this reason.|`|zLoyo24Taa	Because people do not realize that having a pet is a commitment and they are living things not just toys.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Quite often, the puppy is cute, cuddles, looks like a toy.  Puppies are beings, they need care, food, walks, attention, they cost money. Then they grow up and are no longer the cute puppy they once were then people give up.    They do not realize that an animal is just as much responsibility as any other creature on this planet.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	I volunteer at a local shelter in my area. The shelter like many shelters has that policy in the contract that if you cant keep a pet for whatever reason you are to return them to the shelter. A few weeks ago a pit bull puppy that was adopted from us showed up on Craigs list. Another volunteer was browsing and spotted him listed for 100$ or it could be negotiable. Their adoption fee would have been 210$ so they werent doing it to refund the fee which is non-refundable.  Management was informed and they had someone call this couple and even had staff member pretending to be interested in him.  The couple finale did bring him back in and all they said was they were moving to Florida (boyfriend got new job)   and could not take him. The thing that I found odd is that they had adopted him on Monday, and the person saw this listing on Friday. Surely they knew that boyfriend had applied for a job out of state and it was very possible that they would be moving.  The puppy got readopt Tuesday so hopefully this home works out better for him.    Some people will impulsively buy a puppy or dog. They do not realize that a dog or puppy is fun but it also requires work as well. If you get a puppy you have to do training and even for an older dog as well.  You have to walk your dog/puppy daily or at least you should its amazing the people who fill out the surrender form stating they never walk their dog or they just walk once or twice a week, maybe a few times a month.      Another thing is people do not do their research before they get a dog/puppy obviously with a mutt it can be hit or miss. If someone is looking for a purebred dog they really need to do their homework find a dog that fits their lifestyle.  I was in the pet section a man had impulsively gotten a Siberian Husky and the dog was chewing on everything and being destructive. Had he done research he would have realized that this is a breed that needs amble amble exercise both physical and mentally or they can become destructive. They also need a strong leader and if they sense you aren't they will walk all over you/not listen to you.  There are also some dogs that take more patients just like people some dogs catch on quickly, with others it can take longer time.  There was one dog that was adopted and returned after 2 days their reason un-trainable  Im like WTF they had this dog for 48 hours.    If someone is going to get someone a gift that is living creature it would be best that they talk to this person, and help them find a pet that will fit their lifestyle.  Very true Kate sometimes a puppy will get too big and I can understand this in the case of someone who got a mutt puppy as one never knows how big these puppies might get. I pet sat for a women who volunteered at another shelter a man turned in a purebred Great Dane saying the dog had gotten too big. To me that is crazy because he got a breed that is a large dog, probably one of the biggest dogs.       Anyone looking to get a dog would be wise to look in Cesar Millans book Cesar way, he has list of 10 questions for people to answer to see if they are truly ready for dog ownership     A few examples  Am I committed to walking my dog for at least one and a half hours every day? (or will I simply let him go out  in the backyard and rationalize that he is getting plenty of  outdoor exercise?) Am I committed to providing regular food and water for my dog? ( Or will I feed him only when I remember?) If a person does not pass he recommends that they get a cat or a pet that will be lower maintenance.|`|e5f653fd9ea6d45ba494dc98e20a237faa	Its very well possible..or the other possibility is that they didn't realize the work that it takes to take care of a puppy and its just too over whelming for them!|`|q9BItD25aa	Some people don't realize what a job it is to take care of a pup........|`|QMlWKN6maa	I think it really depends on the people.    Sometimes people think oh it's a cute puppy but don't think about the mess they make, the responsibility behind it & even sometimes the financial responsibility.    Sometimes people get a puppy/kitty for a gift also, & can't really afford it.    In some situations it could be just wanting $$ though, based on the breed of dog they could make some money off of it.    I also know a girl that adopts puppy's/kitty's from a shelter that are about to be killed & sells them at whatever fee she paid for them so shes not losing a bunch of money.|`|2fb47d9f780ad38758b903b84af1726eaa	it could be financial issues, it could be the unexpected amount of work. maybe they got a breed that isn't good for their lifestyle....sure the aussie pup is cute but it also is high energy and needs walks. sometimes people get them as gifts and they aren't wanted. its sad and i think people need to put more thought into it before they just get a pet.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I think people like that are really just impulsive and too hasty to rush into things that are major commitments.|`|XTgTs7Xuaa	Lucy da cat thinks people do that because they know dogs drool and cats RULE!!|`|IJ75DUkEaa	Because the puppy ruined something that was more important to the owners than the puppy.  Instead of sending the dog to the glue or dog food factory, they unload on to someone else.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	Irresponsible people, personally I don't believe in pet trafficking, all cats and dogs should be with their biological doggy families...     Then the trend for pre-birth matching of special breed puppies- don't even get me started on that one...    I'm disgusted in people who see a bargain puppy and then sell it to the highest bidder days later. Don't they know that puppy with have bonding issues later on. Why didn't they know they couldn't cope with the puppy when they paid all that money for it. Didn't they know that puppy has needs and would be work when they got it home. How could they reject it just because it needs love and playtime, and to go for walks, all puppies need to feel loved and few rainbows and unicorns thrown in to keep them happy. (How these puppy owners passed the home study is beyond me.)    The RSPCA has a lot to answer for for allowing these practices to continue.

Or maybe ask him if there is something he would like to do.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Teens have to have something to do after school. Does he like any sports? Most schools have a bunch of clubs that meet after school. If he doesn't like them still have him try them for a couple of meetings. If your lucky something will stick.

If they like to play an instrument, lessons are always a good thing too.  However, if you want something that he can do at home it is always a good idea to give kids chores.

Alexis  Hannah  Leah  Noelle  Anika  Anita  Arianna  Adrianna      Best of Luck!|`|CBVCcTXSaa	what was the fathers name, is their some way of including that, i know its a girl but you could use the female version of his name|`|SMhcM5Cxaa	Astrid - Did you get that from Halloween-town 2?!     and I prefer Rayna with the middle of Angeline or Angelina. I think it sounds very feminine but not too traditional.|`|dAniZ4ouaa	Rayna-Jane sounds really pretty
JpmKtpqmaa	No hun you are just very intrigued by him and like him A LOT....its alright as long as you don't do anything you aren't ready for!!!! Plus you're a little too young to be thinking about a boyfriend..but as long as you act asa child and stick to doing the things children should do..You're only a child once so make the best out of it!!!! So you can talk to him and go out with him.... Ask him to a moive or something...that seems simple enough and it will give you a chance to get to know him better and the type of person he is!!!!|`|xst7KYQ3aa	kady, we really DO need to talk more often :P  you got a big crush all right (the term puppy love annoys me).  Follow your heart, and trust your instincts.  He sounds really nice too.  Take it slow, follow what you have been taught and your feelings right now.  You never forget your first romance, and i hope yours is wonderful|`|T9bCVRzVaa	You just have a big crush. Try going out with him and if things get weird then tell him you just wanna be friends.
Wc3Vge9taa	I think that you should tell her. If it was your friend and had 5 kids and work i'm sure i would be way to tired/busy  to notice.|`|Jswomud7aa	Don't say anything. Just by asking the question means that it's probably not a good idea to bring it up to your girlfriend.     If you aren't close enough with her to be comfortable bringing up the topic on your own means you shouldn't do it.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	You don't .  You have a daughter so you know that people get protective of their children.  You can however, mention that she does seem to be a little more active than the other children.  Say something nonchalant like " Wow, if you could bottle her energy, you could really make some money."    I would not come straight out and say " Hey, I think your kid has a problem."  Also, and I mean this with no offense, its not your place.  The child has a doctor and the doctor is the one that could say something.      However, if you absolutely have your mind set on saying something, I would  say something light like " Your daughter is so sweet, I am just worried that maybe she is a little more active than the others."  Think about how you would want someone to bring it up to you.    Like you said you don't want to lose her friendship so be very very careful.  good luck.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	You say nothing. You're not a Dr. and therefore cannot diagnose a child.    EDIT: I AM a parent, therefore I recognize that every child is different, whether they have ADHD or not.|`|nrQijvMuaa	I understand that the little girl you baby sit may show signs of ADHD, but you can't compare your daughter to her just by the way they act.Every child is different. I understand as well some parents refuse to believe stuff like that & are in denial. If you feel that you might lose her as a friend your best bet is to not say anything,but if you know that she won't get offended then tell her. I think it's good as a friend to let her know especially for the child's best interest and especially for the future when going got school.|`|OlPwUM8aaa	Do you know what they do to children with ADHD. they usually put them on a drug called ritalin which spaces them out they do not enjoy childhood like they would have straight. And this drug has been linked to Schizophrenia. If you love your friend and you love her daughter let it lie. She needs to run and play and be feisty when in our society did it become abnormal for children to get a little crazy we all did it when we were kids the only difference is now we are more confined to the indoors where it is more noticeable and disruptive to our parents. If we were at the park they wouldn't even notice how hyper we were. My little brother was on ritalin as a child now he has been diagnosed with schizophrenia with no other cases anywhere in our family tree.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	You can't (or shouldn't) diagnose toddlers with ADD or ADHD. Toddlers shouldn't be given meds like that.     It's also possible that the child just isn't all that comfortable with you.     If you feel the need to say anything, just say that she hasn't really been focusing on anything, and ask if she's that way at home. Then leave it alone.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Say nothing. She will notice it and if not her dr will.|`|AA10120592	she's 3! these things you see as "signs" of adhd, could very well be this little girls normal behavior. don't compare the two kids. I had my daughter the same time as a friend of my hubby, and our two kids were night and day. While hers would sit quietly and play, mine was a crazy monkey climbing the walls. But i had no problem with it, and if this mother doesn't notice anything, than she obviously doesn't have a problem with it either. Don't go stick'n your nose where there isn't a problem. if the mom was complaining that would be another issue.|`|9a8Nfcbjaa	If it were my kid and you were my friend, I would value your opinion and want to know.  Doesn't mean I'd agree but you might have noticed somethings that I missed.  But I agree, in a 3 yr old, it is usually normal behavior.  ADHD is usually not diagnosed until school aged.|`|fpGroPpzaa	Just tell her, you are not judging her child. You are only pointing out a possible medical problem. If you are right, she will thank you for making her aware. If you are wrong, she should still thank you for your concern.|`|Q2Sx1Du3aa	I wouldn't say anything to her unless the child does something that hurts yours.  Some people take offense to things like that, especially when it involves their children even if it isn't necessarily a bad thing.  She will notice it when she is "ready" to deal with it.|`|krI2fziJaa	Unless you are an expert in the field of diagnosing ADHD, it is a very touchy subject. You may tell her that her daughter seems a little hyper, but that could just be her personality. You may bring up the subject of having her doctor evaluate her behavior, but at this young age it is hard to diagnose. If you help get her in a school-like routine, it may help her calm down. Have story time, quiet circle time, things like that. She may just need preschool to help calm her down. It helped my son who was hyper and he did not have ADHD. He was just a busy child.|`|H6N3IPYmaa	I don't think you should say anything. You aren't a doctor to make such an assumption. Every child is different. But I don't care what anyone say a 2-4 yr old is hyper anyway. They have a lot of energy. My daughter is 2 1/2 and when I tell you she has so much energy I bet you you would think she is adhd also but when I tell her that's enough she knows to bring it down! I take her to gymnastic practice in a class that is 18months-3 yr old and all the kids are like jumping jacks that never stop. I take her around my family with kids her age and all them are the same way. So do we determine all the kids are adhd? Of course not. Just be cool and be a good friend to your friend|`|0Yn6n8Qbaa	I think you shouldn't say anything. For me I believe that we shouldn't think that child have A.D.H.D. the child is 3. Children have a lot Energy. I believe we should wait till their older to say if they have A.D.H.D.
iNBLWIFKaa	Yes, its possible that your urine was not concentrated enough to detect the pregnancy hormone. Try testing first thing in the morning. You could have also miscalculated your period dates.|`|DPegPYRPaa	Yes it isn't always accurate. Have a doctor test you again.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	Yes but I would bet that your period is just going to be late. If you don't get it be monday I would call the docs|`|AnW3dzQfaa	I say no.  It happened to me and when I went to the doctors' then found I had a little cyst that was causing me not to have my period.  Wait a couple more days and if it's still neg go to your doctor and see what's up.
LkOcJRRWaa	You should consult your physician because you won't get adequate answers here and we may not be able to help you.|`|nqR7CQ4gaa	I think it is normal. I think the blood is coming from your back side. Call your doctor to be sure. Good Luck!|`|TsFG4zLmaa	of course you should be concerned with blood.  i would at lease call your doctor.  i had bad cheese cravings when i was pregnant with my first child.  i would eat hunks of cheese.  one day i fell over from pain and thought i was having a miscarage, but i was only constipated.  my husband bought me prune juice, nasty, but warm it up and drink it and it will help     good luck!!|`|OQdPzl15aa	Constipation is normal, and hemorrhoids result from constipation which can cause bleeding.  ALL safe and normal.    To relieve the constipation, drink some Mylanta or Prune Juice. I tried the prune juice last week, and I was "cleaned out" in about 30 seconds. lol =0]|`|SzNmGV0Daa	Depends on the amount and color. Of course you are going to be concerned, I would be. I would let my Doctor know and see if they want you to come in to check your HCG levels, just to make sure the baby is progressing like the lil baby should. Goodluck and constipation will be your friend until you deliver. One of the many joys of pregnancy.|`|51mMKAOTaa	i hve no idea|`|AA11336578	well if you havent gone for a while maybe it just tore a little tissue in that area it should stop next time you wipe to see|`|9a3sNrEqaa	Hey hun. Trust me! Call your dr! B/c as it may just be normal spotting I would want to get your progesterone levels checked out. And if your progesterone is low causing you to bleed if you catch it early enough on the dr can give you a shot to help your pregnancy. PLEASE trust me! Call your dr! GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!
PFO1jxZGaa	If you get emancipated you would have to be able to support yourself, like rent and utilities and groceries etc, which easily run up to 2000  a month... Cant you find someone else to live with like an aunt or friend or a grandparent? If nothing else call childprotective services and they will place you somewhere but sometimes those places might be worse then where you are coming from..|`|KwJDWvB3aa	why dont you live with your grandparents?|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Call 1-800-4-a-child    turn them in for child neglect.  In the system you will be able to finish your education and have a safe place to live.    You are to young to be emancipated.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I think you need to be 16 to be emancipated and you must be able to support yourself or be married to someone who can support you. Your only option right now is foster care. If you were allowed to be emancipated, where would you go? How would you eat? Who would make sure you went to school everyday? If you were thinking of living at a friends house, maybe you parents could sign over custody of you temporarily to your friend's parents. Do you have any aunts that could help you? What about your grandmother? She will help her druggy son but not her innocent granddaughters? I'm sorry you have to go through all of this....I was there too. I will pass and things will get better. Learn lessons from those around you, don't try and experience them for yourself. Good luck!|`|s8SnVmXvaa	You have a very slim chance of them allowing you to be emancipated.  Especially at your age.  I'm not sure if the laws vary by state, but I know where I live 15 year olds are not allowed to hold full time jobs.  So how would you support yourself?      Do you have other relatives you can live with?  Find out.  Otherwise you might end up in foster care.  Foster homes are sometimes wonderful, other times not so great.  But it should be better than what  you're going through now.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	go to a police station to find out some answers to your question|`|IlL66aQoaa	First of all the ONLY way a court will emancipate you is legal marriage, demonstrated financial independence, or military service. If you arent in any of those positions you'll be wasting your time.    " If a child can arrange for his or her own suitable housing, food, clothing and other essential needs, the parents can consider an emancipation agreement. This doesn't have to be a formal legal procedure, but a family court judge may want to examine the child's living arrangements and financial records if a legal dispute should arise. The child may also seek a formal court order establishing his or her legal status as an emancipated minor. This does not mean, however, that an unhappy 15-year-old girl can secure a job at a fast food restaurant for minimum wage and declare herself emancipated. The key to this type of emancipation is true financial independence, with a real need to enter into contracts before the age of majority."|`|z6Vmgw5Waa	You cannot be emancipated until you're 18, you need to tell your local authorities what you're telling us, you and your sister will be put in foster care and live better than you're doing now.|`|xMy0QEvFaa	They're going to expect a lot out of you and don't get your hopes up about getting emancipated, because since your only 14 I doubt they're going to pass it and to get emancipated it isn't free, it's alot of money.  So please try and stay with your grandparents or go to a safe house.
2c4c1ed4956562c692dc58b8de0f77d8aa	Being paid an hourly rate for a few hours of babysitting is fine if the parents are going out to dinner and a movie.  But if you are providing "round the clock" care for these kids for more than just a few hours (especially for overnight and MOST especially for 10 days while the parents are out of the country!) then you should be paid as a Nanny on a daily rate.  An hourly rate would apply for anything less than 8 or 10 hours (you decide), anything over that 8 or 10 hours, or is overnight, automatically reverts to the daily rate.  EXAMPLE:  $5.00 per hour for up to 10 hours; $75.00 for more than 10 hours or for an overnight.|`|2jMFurDoaa	i totally have been thru this!    i watched my coworkers newborn so she and her husband could go party. i told them 7 bucks an hour. thats more than fair, so that night they left at 4 and came back at 9 am the next day.... I got 50 dollars. thats almost 3 bucks an hour. to wake up every 4 hours and feed him change dirty diapers and be thrown up on.    so i asked her if she expected me to go home after i put him to bed. she looked at me really sort of scared and said no. then i asked well i was here 17 hours.     she went on to tell me that she only gets paid 7 bucks an hour and cant afford to give me 7 bucks an hour.     well she shouldnt have had a baby if she cant afford child care!    needless to say i never watched her child again and she couldnt understand why lol    you deserve to be paid for the time the child is under your care. if the parents dont like it dont watch there kids. $2 an hour is just..obscene. for 2 children you deserve at least $5 per child if not more considering one is a baby.  you are right. i wouldnt watch her kids anymore if shes going to be cheap. it doesnt matter how old you are, she must think you are mature enough to handle overnights so he should pay you for the time you are in charge of her kids.     let her find some one else to watch to her kids, i dont think any one will stay long when she is going to be like that.|`|DPegPYRPaa	Of course! What if one woke up? Unless they are not at home, at school, or something else like that, the children are still in your care and yes, you should be paid for it.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	if there in ur presence and ur solely taking care of them you should expect to be paid including when they are sleeping. not when they are at school obvisously because they won't be with you but yes if she refuses to pay it don't babysit|`|b81H0vlYaa	Yes, they should pay you for that time.  If you weren't there with their children, they would not be able to go anywhere.  Also, you could be going to a party and staying out all night, but you must stay at their house all night to make sure the children are ok.  So if the job requires you to stay there for a certain amount of hours, you should be paid for that amount of hours.  I would get the money situation agreed upon before agreeing on babysitting again.    Maybe you could give them 1/2 off the price per hour for the hours they sleep, this would be a good compromise.|`|c42C3pZQaa	Yes. You need to be paid for watching them while they are sleeping. Do they expect the walls to dial 911 if something happens while they are dreaming of sugar plums? You may want to charge less per hour while they are sleeping, because it is easier than the hours they are awake. Daycare teachers get paid during nap time, too. You are there for the kids' safety and well-being. You need to be paid for that, and if they don't pay you then obviously the kids can watch themselves while they are sleeping!|`|dShnJ20raa	I normally charge 6 an hour during the day for up to 3 kids plus an extra 1 an hour for each additional child and I actually charge 7 an hour up to $60 during the night. I feel that since I am being responsible for their children and with previous experience that if something is going to go wrong it will more than likely go wrong at the worst time- and that time is usually in the middle of the night. Also children, especially young children, tend to get more upset during the night when their parents aren't around. During the day it is easier to distract them and keep their minds preoccupied but at night all they want is their mom or dad to tuck them in or make the nightmares go away. Good luck. I would tell them that if they refuse to pay you reasonably then they will have to find other babysitters and also warn those you know around your area who babysit to speak with them about getting paid during the nights. When they have difficulty finding a skill sitter they will be less likely to argue over paying at night.|`|jdRKZe18aa	She is taking advantage of you!  OF COURSE you should be paid for ALL the hours you are there.. Would she prefer you LEAVE since they are sleeping and she doesn't  think your time is WORTH ANYTHING to remain there and be a custodian and guardian of her kids because they are SLEEPING?  OH PLEEEEZZZ     I would honestly settle on a PRICE not an hourly rate and make it worth your while - YOU Are doing her a HUGE favor and if she can't pay you what it is worth to you - then tell her NO - she can go find someone else.|`|flqAr30laa	yes, but it should be a flat rate, say like X amt overnight. or x amt for the week/s.   I agree with you, a child must never be left alone at any time esp at night. even thought the kids are asleep , you are still sitting.  Stand your ground!|`|AA10494763	Yes of course you get paid while they sleep. If not you can tuck them in then leave and come back in the morning.  You need to be there and can't do anything else so you have to be paid|`|bIaywrBCaa	I would charge by the day not the hour. About $25 a day.|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	Speaking as a former babysitter, I do think that you should be paid for those overnight hours when they are asleep.  As you said, you are still responsible if something happens.  Perhaps you can charge a slightly lower rate during those overnight hours, but you should be paid for those hours nonetheless as you are supervising their children (even just making sure they are asleep and healthy).|`|TzY9vkinaa	I get paid for watching mentally handicapped people at night while they are sleeping.  I think the same should go for children.|`|C6UpJfhiaa	You are absolutely right. They should pay you for all hours you are with the children.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	You absolutely should! It's not like you can leave while they are asleep. That was your time spent with their kids and you should be paid for every minute of it. Don't let them take advantage of you.|`|J6vPhmmLaa	Yes, I do think that they should be paid because it is their time that they are giving up to babysit. BUT if it is a family member I (as the babysitting) would not charge them as much as during the day. I would just take 10 dollars or something.|`|eeGN977eaa	YES you should get paid for the hours they are asleep. But I do think a daily rate would be more appropriate in this case.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	It sounds like these people can be difficult to work with. I think it's fair to be paid when the children are sleeping because you are there watching them and making sure everything is going smoothly. Basically, these child's lives are in your hands and you are making sure they are healthy and safe.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	You could charge a little less while they are sleeping but you still need to get paid.  What if the child wakes up?  You're there to respond to emergencies and watch over the children and home.  You should be getting paid for that.  During school time is a different story.  Unless you have to pick the child up or are watching over the home, you should not get paid during that time.  There are plenty of babysitting jobs out there.  Post at you local grocery store or community bored and find a different one if this family can't pay you for your time.|`|veO1RXrCaa	You are in the right. They are trying to cheat you.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	Yes, you should be paid. You are still there, making sure they are safe while they are asleep, and not only that, you are taking time out of your day to sit on their couch when you could be out with friends family. She's taking advantage of you, i'd explain it was not right and you would not come back again if they did that.|`|14f43f349bb66eb9fca9c31edef61771aa	yea someone have watch the children. what u suppose to do leave the children. but if you was to leave the children and something happen the first person they going to do is point fingers at you and then call the police. And u possibly faces charges of child endangerment.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Absolutely.  You're still responsible, and believe me, when babies get sick or have some emergency, it's usually the middle of the night!|`|W0gMQVoDaa	yes you should be paid for all the hours that you are in charge of the children xx|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	You should be getting paid much more than two dollars an hour. It doesn't matter what the kids are doing, you should be getting paid b/c they will be under your care. Be careful with this couple, they seem kinda dumb. It's kinda like they would leave their kids by themselves when they are sleeping to avoid having to pay someone to watch them!!|`|oM6Pem1Waa	you are right.they have to pay for the hours the kids were sleeping because you were spending your time talking care of them.|`|nzHtrczVaa	If they don't want to pay you while the child is sleeping, tell them that you plan to leave while they are asleep, see if that wakes them up, they are being cheap.|`|SZdT1r8saa	Yes, You should be paid for all the hours you spend with the children!  How ridiculous is that lady!?!?|`|MMnjWEM7aa	They should've paid you for all hours that their children were under your care.      Do they think you had 100% freedom once their heads hit their pillows?    "Alrighty honey, now that those kids are asleep, let's go out drinking!"    I didn't think so.    These folks owe you money.  At the very least, you never have to do them another favor...|`|3b042baeb993c8dc0d7c7bc9bc4817f2aa	Yes you should be paid for the time the child is in your care, that includes when the child is sleeping.  While you are the caregiver you should be paid.  Your time is what you're being paid for...so if the kids are sleeping is it ok for you to run off to the movies or go get drunk?  NO...you are responsible for the kids.      Most people do not do an hourly rate for a 10 day period though.  They pay a base amount. Maybe you should figure out the hourly in your head and present it as a base rate.  If she won't pay it, then don't take the job.    Of course, I don't think a whole lot of parents that would leave a 1 and a 5 year old with sitters for 10 days...nice parenting....must have seemed like forever to the children...and they're off again?|`|ylgNuE3uaa	Definitely get paid!  Anytime you are taking on the responsibility of someone else with their children, even if they are asleep, not only from the standpoint of "if something happened", you are there, but also because you are at THEIR home. Away from yours. If you aren't getting paid, ask them "Am I allowed to leave at night while they are asleep then??" (OBVIOUSLY NOT) SO yeah, you need them to pay you.    Time is money. Period.|`|hSJnaysiaa	Well, paying hourly for 10 days would be quite expensive but they should have worked out a reasonable amount to pay you, that you felt was worth it.    I absolutely think that a babysitter should be paid for night-time duty too, even if the kids are asleep, just maybe at a slightly lesser rate. I mean, would te lady you babysat for go to work in the night and not expect to be paid just because there was no work to do? No, she would expect to be paid. Its your time they are paying you for, time you could be spending doing something else, so they need to pay accordingly. But, be fair with it too and maybe don't charge the same amount when they're asleep as you do when they are awake.|`|AA11553531	even though they're sleeping we are still in charge and if something were to happen and they got sick we would be up taking care of them.  ....totally correct and justified!  charging by the day in that case or the week as the case may be is a very good option.  if they arent willing to pay for ur service u r not willing to provide said services.....its as simple as that!
T48smu01aa	I actually quit my job b/c they were doing illegal stuff and it was very harmful for me and I was TTC this was right b4 everything started to go down hill in our economy... well anyways I ended up being pregnant when I quit and didn't know it....I tried looking for another job while I filed unemployment I got unemployment and no one is still hiring my husband and I just decided that we will probably have to live off one income and we will make it work...so thats what were doing and its good so far were saving for baby and we do have a lot of family support....But if you have someone that is helping like your husband then I promise you things will work out don't stress they always work out even if you have to work hard for it will always work out!!!!  good luck and congrats!!!|`|XI7JLX6gaa	that must suck- i would cry =[|`|avpv7u8saa	No but that would suck    If that happens then the Boss is a *****|`|4gkepThIaa	YESH|`|7jDyJRLyaa	I got hired for a job when I was 7 months pregnant.  If you're "showing" it shouldn't be an issue.  That would be discrimination.  Although, I can see the employer's point in having to jump through all the hoops of hiring a pregnant woman then having her gone on maternity leave.  I was just lucky, I guess.|`|I5l0nBuvaa	Definitely sue if you were fired or laid off.|`|P7Bu2I8eaa	Apply for unemployment ASAP.... no company will hire you knowing you will be there temp, and go for a maternity leave, and with the economy its very hard. In the mean time apply for welfare, you will get cash every 2 weeks, and food stamps once a month if you qualify. Good Luck, and dont stress it because you can hurt the baby.     I never was fired, but Im on the verge of being fired and im only 8 weeks preggo, and its hard and I could only imagine what predictament your in...     Best of luck!!!!|`|I7myOp8Qaa	My husband and I both got laid off on the day we found out we were pregnant. We worked for the same company and the company closed shop. Needless to say the first 3 months were very stressful for me. I applied to jobs all over the place and got a job teaching online. You might want to try jobs that dont require you to leave home so that your pregnancy does not become an 'issue'. Whatever people might say, they tend not to call you back when they see your belly. I also applied at a temp agency and honestly told them I was pregnant. They never called back. Either way I am glad I have a job.    Try online jobs, those might be a good bet for you. If not, just take this time off (if you can afford it) and relax.|`|0k5Go8m7aa	I am 33 weeks pregnant and just got fired this week. We just closed on our new house last week.  It is a very scary feeling.  The only thing I know to do is to collect unemployment. It feels weird because of the stigma that goes along with it and I've never not had a job. But seriously nobody is going to hire someone ready to pop in  a few weeks. I can barely bend over, what kind of work could I do? Does anyone know of programs available??|`|eBT0KY4Faa	first off thats illegal to be fired just because your pregnant. you should talk to a lawyer if you were.|`|4d4Y4xGdaa	I don't have a job, I'll never get a job in the town where I live. It's so small, and it's a last name based thing around here. Anyway, I am 6 weeks pregnant, I do however have income coming in. NOT MUCH though, around 200 dollars a month. I will not be worrying much about how my baby will be taken care of though. His/Her dad will take care of all that. I just live day to day I guess.|`|4AO2myzKaa	Well, I'm getting laid off at month's end, but I'm also due at the same time so can sort of relate.  I'm going to collect unemployment while I spend time with the baby, and then see what happens from there (my hub works so we aren't going to go hungry).  I'm sorry you are in this mess, see if you can work at a temp agency or a "child centered" store, such as the Children's Place in the mall for employment before baby is born.  Otherwise, you will need to look for work and just be honest if they ask.  It sucks because a lot of time people won't hire you knowing you are pregnant, it happened to a friend of mine where she was offered the job and then after she told them she was pregnant they told her they had given her job to someone else..not right!!|`|fHjSonssaa	I lost my job the day after I found out I was pregnant.  It was devastating.  I filed for unemployment right away but was denied because I had just started that job.    I was starting to feel so sick- I didn't know what to do!  So I started my own little business.  It didn't make much money- but it's floral design, and it's what I do.    I still have the business and do a little here and a little there for the time being.    I did apply to a few places- but after I got turned down I decided it just wasn't going to work by the time I found a job and then had to leave for maternity leave-   so I'm a stay at home mom now.  And it's the most rewarding job in the world.  Our bank account is as small as it comes, but I manage to spoil my son by skipping out on things for me.    My parnter even has to pay child support to his ex- she refuses to get a job even though she sends the kids to daycare and school and the state pays for all of it.  I think it's terrible.    I didn't go back to work because it seemed stupid for me to pay someone to take care of my son while I was at work all day only to bring home almost nothing after paying for childcare.    I still take on weddings when I can (flowers)- for a little extra spending.  But they're few and far between.|`|Oohxa4dxaa	umm, ive never but i know people that have.  well they look around for jobs, there not going to come to you, obviously.    or file for unemployment.    haha|`|qusKbEmBaa	No, you usually get fired when you dont perform your job  at the companies standard or you just didnt obey the company rules, and I never got laid off before( THANK GOD), and im suprised because in this bad economy everybody is losing their job.  Hope i helped.!  ( i need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as best answers, thanks )|`|XkWTsyJdaa	my aunts baby is due soon. she got laid off in oct/nov. she ended up not getting a job again because of the scarcity and she decided it wouldnt hurt tooo much to be out of work for a couple months because she'd be out soon anyways for maternity leave. her husband ended up providing since then, and it has been hard for them, but they've been doing great with saving and not spending money.
qH3pVH7Paa	if your period was due and you had only light bleeding, or spotting, i think it is the right time to take a pregnancy test now. but if it comes negative i would still re-test the date your period is due next month.

3MmVWDT3aa	I would say that you feel a bit self-conscious about yourself since your body is changing. If you are, then wear a cami underneath your clothes so that people can't tell if you're wearing one or not.    You could also try saying that you would prefer more support on your chest. I used to have the same problem- all my mom would buy me was training. It just takes time.|`|HFvvowmGaa	tell her you think it's time that you should start wearing bras, all your friends are wearing them and you would feel more comfortable wearing a bra|`|cLgghhuXaa	No offense hun but they only make bras so small... maybe that is why she says no... (sorry) that said... maybe you could/should BUY YOUR OWN BRA if you want one badly enough!    You can go to stores like Rainbow/Deb/Wal*Mart,etc... and buy bras on sale for as little as 3 to 8 dollars!|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	Tell her that guys can see your nipples through your shirt and it's very embarrassing and that you want to wear a sports bra so that they can't. that should work.
9d99924ae7cd2add40a289bc1930a1b4aa	after 3 months|`|4AO2myzKaa	Congratulations!  You know, wait as long as you are comfortable.  Since you had a previous miscarriage, your clinic will likely do an 8 week ultrasound to verify strong heart beat, etc.  Once you have that things are likely to go smoothly.  Others tell right away, and others wait until 13 weeks (2nd tri).  Personally, I also lost a baby at 6 weeks, but told my close friends and family right away.  I know some were cautious but my thoughts were I would rather have more people praying for me.  Plus, my mom would have been really ticked had I told her months later!  Anyway, do what you feel is best, and congrats on your little one!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Wait until after 12 weeks, thats what I did with this one. I too have had a miscarriage before and breaking the sad news to everyone really sucked. Atleast after 12 weeks, your chances of miscarriage drop below 5%.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Tell close family, like parents, but wait to tell friends/coworkers till your first trimester ends or is near end (14 weeks), because that is the time frame for most miscarriages. Even though its a long wait.|`|S5v9I0y2aa	Congrats!  Really, it's your decision as a couple, but  we told those close to us right away. (a few close friends and parents).  We figured if something went wrong with the pregnancy, we would need their support.  Then we waited the 3 months to tell everyone else.    But do what feels right for you!  I know it was a huge moral support to be able to speak to my mom about all the pregnancy stuff, because we are so closely related, our bodies went through similar things, and it was great to have her there for the reassurance.    All the best!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I think you should tell your close family - like your mother, so IF anything happens you will have their support.    And when you feel ready tell other people|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Miss Manners suggests not telling until just before people can figure it out for themselves -- just before you show.|`|4Yw20J6Saa	I know it is going to be hard to wait, but I would say wait until you are almost out of your first trimester. Because then your chances of miscarriage are minimal.|`|1qnbvUYPaa	12 to 14 weeks i safe to tell people =]|`|Sl9ybZT7aa	I thinks really great but it better to wait and see.|`|bd206b850f2fec243858724c57950888aa	I told my mother as soon as I found out, but I waited to tell friends and other family members until I was well into my second trimester when my chances for miscarriage decrease dramatically.  To be honest, only you can make such a personal decision, though.  Only you can determine the type of relationship before telling them about your pregnancy!  Good luck and have a happy and healthy pregnancy!
Ccq8zEcnaa	I had the same thing and my doc put me on calcium & vit D supplements. He told me it was the baby robbing from my bones, and that if I didn't take care of myself by taking the supplements... then I could end up with osteoporosis later in life. Try oscal, it's the best calcium supplement... And talk to your doc to make sure it's nothing serious.
miPubuDYaa	I think that alot of unmarried teens and young adults think about abortion when they are confronted with an unplanned pregnancy. However many (if not most) do not go the route of aborting thier baby. Many keep it and some even give it to adoption.     I can't understand why someone who consider abortion even for a millisecond would then abuse thier baby. People have weeknesses and when faced with being young and pregnant and up against a wall, abortion might be an idea. Then when they come to thier senses and keep that baby. They love it, cherish it and realized how did they live without that baby before. Why would they want to abusive that baby.    You can't get stats on how many people consider abortion and then don't do it because no one can read people minds.|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	I'm pregnant and 16 years old. I'll be having my baby before I even turn 17. And I'm going to keep it. The thought of abortion never crossed my mind. No child should have to die because its parents made a mistake. It has ever right to be born. I'm not sure I understand your question though.
P3e2kJtwaa	her eggo isnt prego. promise :)|`|Bs8sllD9aa	There is no way she is pregnant. the headaches are most likely from the bright light|`|bZWbwyn4aa	Sperm cannot survive in the open air, so no, she is not pregnant.  An hour later, that sperm would have been well and truly dead. Don't know what's causing her migraines, but it certainly isn't a pregnancy.|`|pVWk12oOaa	No she's not pregnant|`|pISC6pphaa	Sperm dies in the air pretty quick, and there's no way it's going to get to the vagina through underwear.  You need to ejaculate inside the woman to get her pregnant.  Tell your friend to quit worrying.  Stress can make your period late! :)    If she's really concerned, get a prego test.  7-15 dollars at Wal-mart.|`|7uqOSZNKaa	no offence mate but if u, ur mate or her boyfriend really need to ask if that could have made her pregnant then none of you should be having sex! go get the barbies out!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	No that can't make her pregnant.|`|GDobAMQ8aa	She's not pregnant.  The headaches could be caused by anything, including very bright lights; besides, headaches/migraines aren't a pregnancy symptom.  Tell her she has no reason to be worrying.    Edit:  First of all, you didn't say he fingered (or "frigged") her after he came.  You said they were "lying there in there underwear and his penis rubbed on her".  You said nothing about any penetration.  So, we're going by what you said.|`|SKqV374maa	go to the drug store and get a test|`|e8259d706e4c0ff624821e09f8c00d53aa	No. Not pregnant.|`|McRoWQrAaa	unless it found itself in her vagina  then no shes not pregnant.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Tell her not to worry there is no such thing as airborne pregnancy.|`|CLcGxHpAaa	No.  If your friend does not know how one gets pregnant, she should probably refrain form ANY sexual activity.|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	Nope she can't be prego. *** that has touched the air cannot make her prego. Tell her not too worry because its not possible.|`|AA12379225	It is very unlikely that she is pregnant - but she should get an early pregnancy test at the drugstore or Walmart, do a simple quick test and find out. It will be worth the few dollars not to worry about it!|`|jn34aSgHaa	no thats not possible is there was no actual sex then there is nothing to worry about!!! she must be stressed but those are not signs of pregnancy.|`|06O8FaOjaa	NOOO YOU CANT BE PREGNANT MAYBE THE LITE WAS TOO BRITE THATS EVAN CAUSED MEH A FEW HEADACHES LOL
EBkGtGjDaa	well she is under the age of consent so  tell an adult ( some one trusted)    also    MOST IMPORTANT read THIS and TALK BEFORE sex:    1. what protection would do you plan to use?    2. do you know that protection is not a 100% and can fail? BUT BETTER THAN NOTHING!    3. would you make you partner use protection?     4. what would you do if someone got pregnant or you got an std?    5. you do know it only takes once to get pregnant or get std?    here is a list to make sure ready:    1. when BOTH 100% ready mentally, physically, and emotionally    2, your NOT doing it to prove anything, or to keep someone.    3.you know all the myths about sex, you know all the facts about sex, you know about all the protect how effective they are and what would be best for you.    4. you know all the pros and con and will to take the responsibility for what could happen.    5. you keep learning about sex: http://plannedparenthood.org and http://sexinfo101.com    e-mail me if you have any questions    I'm 19 a virgin ( god damn proud of it) with my bf (virgin too) dating for 11 months and no sex|`|838VJJGvaa	Give her some condoms and ask her if she'd like to tell her mom.  Sex has a big toll of emotions of young people.    13?!|`|cLgghhuXaa	Are you afraid  FOR her? My concern would be... Is she having UNPROTECTED sex? This can lead to diseases and/or pregnancy.    And because you love your cousin... you don't want her sick or with a kid she doesn't want.    Talk to an adult you trust OUTSIDE of your family... or even within your family if you truly TRUST them.... ask them to address the issue for you!    *** I realize I'm just some internet chick... but if you give me an email I would gladly do it for YOU! (I'd email her parents stating things plainly but kindly...)|`|ojTcrqAOaa	Its not telling on her if its serious.    Basically having sex at 13 is serious..  So it's not like your tattling on her..or something..|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	I would try to convince her to tell her mom. And maybe get her some condoms. If she got pregnant chances are she would die during birth and I don't think you would want that.|`|AGaT3BDMaa	Oh please dont tell her parents thats liek the worst thing ever! just talk to her you guys are friends right? she will trust you!!!!!!!|`|1ASc1Is7aa	Aye... that is a really hard one. Most likely if you tell her mom I can almost guarantee you she will never talk to you again. Well probably....    but telling her mother would also be the right thing to do. She should NOT be having sex that young.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	ask her if she's planning on getting chlamydia any time soon. If the answer is no then tell her the only thing that is 100% preventive is not to have sex.    But joking aside......I would tell her mother/father. She may hate you for it and you may lose her as a friend but in the long run she will thank you for it because she won't become one of the young, tired, hair scrimped back teenage moms who get no time to themselves and can't go out with their friends.|`|58eHufb3aa	To be honest i'm confused about the answer.  I think you should talk to her, tell her that she shouldn't just throw herself at some boyfriend. Or atleast wait till she's alittle older.  Personally, i wouldn't tell ANYONE. Cause i don't really see it as THAT big of a deal. If you tell her mum it would create just unnecessary mess.|`|kgQK3bMlaa	Tell on her before she gets pregnant.|`|y3u5WYDMaa	warn her of lk consequences and tell her shes getting in over her head and not to wine about it to u    then wish her good luck    its all u can do|`|MIUzgwsTaa	When she's ready to tell her parents she's sexually active she would do so.  And aren't friends suppose to be able to trust their friend when they tell them something personal?|`|C5i0kmtJaa	Thats scary|`|ldN2AL1zaa	Well i think your just jealous at her.    and second it is basically normal for a teen having sex. Don't worry     she will not yet get pregnant....|`|3Y2jRkxcaa	Forget the emotional problems! Anyone can deal with that, it's not like she was raped. Get her some birth control pills and leave her alone. As long as she doesn't get pregnant or get STDs than she will be fine I might even congratulate her for getting the chance to have sex when she was young and it was still exciting. Tell her that it is OK to talk about it with you and that you won't tell on her. When adults get involved in this kind of stuff they treat their kids like babies, instead of letting their kids be responsible individuals and work it out on their own.|`|RBOc42Koaa	Keep it to yourself!      it's none of your business...|`|kmmlc4m7aa	I REALLY THINK YOU SHULD KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.. I HAVE THE SAME RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CUZZO..YOUR LUKKY THAT SHE EVEN TRUSSS YOU ENUFF 2 TELL YOU THAT SHEE IS DOIN THAT .|`|mOJhj3ssaa	try to convince her to tell her parents herself, b/c they need to know.   & you can help things by telling her how to protect herself.. but really tell her to tell her parents.|`|oOIrXIt0aa	iif ya was really friend u wouldn't tell... first she probably get in odhee trouble and her parent wouldn't trust her just leave her alone and stop snitching!!    if she get caugth or end up pregnant is not gonna be your problem..(even tho u care about her) but but your self in her shoes and think will u want sum1 to tell your parent sumin so seriouse.... come on!!|`|GuVNYGqyaa	no as long AS SHE NOT PREGNANT
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Obviously not.

So unless you guys did something that involved that part of your body after doing something with his where *** came out and may have not been fully washed off you can't get pregnant.  go see a doctor about your period, that doesnt mean to check for pregnany, but that  can be a serious medical issue.|`|mOJhj3ssaa	dont worry you are sooo not prego. you could be late for any number of reasons|`|o7yN3cYgaa	Has he been exposed to you area?  && has touched his d***** with *** on it?  If not then noo|`|6tWKN8QVaa	No, not if you didn't have sex.  But, you might want to consider seeing your local doctor about your late periods. Unless you just started your period, you shouldn't have that late periods (it takes about a year for periods to come on schedule)    :)  Hope that helped and good luck.|`|nBHSCu0Xaa	Yes, it is. He can breathe the sperm down your throat, which will be absorbed by your bloodstream.    Come on. Seriously. Go to sex ed class!
lc2WYfeTaa	It's too early to really tell, but I say wait 2-3 weeks see if you get your period(try not to stress) because this will delay your period!! If you don't get it then I would go about getting a pregnancy test but until then just try not to think about it!! It's hard to say that because I've been there but the more you worry the worse it is! Good luck|`|wnkoTEqVaa	use a pee stick.|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Implantation bleeding is like a drop of blood at most.

5f6XnInEaa	You could wait until you are actually due, and stop being so impatient.    The extra two weeks will not kill you, bu it will almost guartuntee a healthy baby.  Why you would want to risk harming your child is beyond me, and quite frankly it shows where your priorities lie, in your own comfort and not in your child's health.|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	You're not even full term yet.

You can try any number of things from nipple stimulation to sex to castor oil. Try them at your own risk though. The castor oil especially has been said to give the mother some bad diarrhoea and can lead to some super painful contractions .Good luck.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	Have a lot of sex it might help if not your at less happy!|`|AA10624857	I vividly remember wanting to go into labor.  All 4 of my kids were born past their due dates by 9 days, 11 days, 5 days, and 7 days.  Especially with my first 2, I was motivated to do what I could to move things along.  I walked for miles, had a lot of sex, ate spicy food, tried nipple stimulation, did squats, walked up and down stairs, drove down bumpy back roads, and scrubbed floors on my hands and knees.  I got tired legs, a very happy husband, terrible heart burn, a dirty car and clean floors.  What I didn't get was my babies to come any quicker.  Some women will swear they did something or ate something than went into labor.  Truly, though, I believe that those women's babies would have come regardless if they did those things or not or ate those things or not.  Babies call the shots when it is time for their birth day.  Even medical inductions don't work a surprising number of times because things just aren't ready yet.  You can walk, have sex, drink Red Raspberry Leaf Tea, have a hot curry, take castor oil, or do any of the many other Old Wives' Tales, however, if both your baby and your body aren't ready, nothing is going to happen.  I do think if there was a tried and true way to get labor started that no one would choose to go past their due dates.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	wait two more weeks until you're due.. or talk to your doctor about induction.|`|IVNM1O5naa	Your baby will come when the baby is ready but.. you can try    -Walking  -Sex  -Spicy Foods  -Sitting on a birthing ball.|`|pVWk12oOaa	go for a long walk, worked for me!!  :)
veO1RXrCaa	I would hope so.  Im 34 weeks too and my belly is sore too.  Its painful and annoying that's for sure.  Could be that the baby is lower.

Completly normal.|`|NPCDWy88aa	If it is the expanding uterus, it will probably persist until after delivery. Some women can get unbilical hernias during pregnancy. If you can feel a lump or bump around the belly button, you should bring this to the attention of your health care provider because this may be a symptom of an umbilical hernia. In any case, if the soreness persists more than two days you should discuss this with your provider, who may want to examine you."|`|iFAlZfVMaa	Very normal.... a pain, quite literally, but normal.....|`|rx0ekB9Paa	yeah it might be stretching. my baby always kicks the top of my stomach so its always sore there. where does ur baby hit u the most?

I would just wait.|`|O0eQpO2naa	Personally me I would wait just to make sure your insission,, but my best friend had sex 1 week after she got pregnant and she's fine. Hope this help if not let me know
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	You need to elaborate on your question, not really sure what the problem is.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    it be that implantation is occuring or conception is occuring.  PMs.  god bless x|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Your having PMS and your period is on it's way!|`|AA11535009	Well if you are a guy, try drinking some water and have a banana. Please eat the banana and try not to wear it.|`|UwIpnN2Iaa	Could mean your period is coming, but if you're late and could be pregnant, you might want to take a test.|`|6JTNujAjaa	If your period is overdue possibly pregnant or stressed, stress will delay your period in some instances even stop it.|`|ebm3n24Vaa	Your period is coming.  What a drag.  :)|`|Uu2z6PR3aa	Your period is coming.  What a drag.  :)|`|HoJ1pLtraa	Probably your period is coming|`|AA11536140	r u meaning muscle cramping?? well i drink a lil water mixed with table salt.....cramp goes away!!|`|pHWUrAEwaa	If you're a guy....nothing. Well, maybe ya got a hard poo in the works.    And if you're a girl, something could be wrong. Talk to your mom, or a nurse. Let a "pro" help you make a decision.|`|L7d3PSgLaa	either go to doc  or your aunt is coming to visit :(
MOsStEbqaa	I wouldn't freak out to much. You just had a baby so that can mess up your periods. But if you have been having sex there is always a higher risk of getting pregnant right after you have a baby. All you can do is take a test.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	If you are breastfeeding you may not have a period for a while. It does take a while after baby to get a normal period back again.|`|gyoylefvaa	If you're breastfeeding you will not have  period for long time. well! after you stop breastfeeding.    If  you not Breastfeeding yes there is a change.    Good luck.|`|Li09Gaqwaa	i didnt get my period until my daughter was 9months old and my periods were regular before being pregnant!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	It may take months for your periods to return after having bub - especially if your breastfeeding|`|qHAgbuHkaa	Well are you breast feeding? If you are, its perfectly normal not to get your period back for awhile..sometimes even a year or more. If you're not breast feeding (I hope you are..formula isn't nearly as healthy) then you should be getting it back soon, but its too early to be concerned. Even if you're not breast feeding, its perfectly normal for it to take a few months for it to come back.|`|6JTNujAjaa	My daughter is 14 weeks and I too have not had a period.Don't stress it will come back in it's own time.Highly unlikely you would be pregnant, continue to use protection, and if it still stays on your mind just take a pregnancy test to put your mind at ease.  Congratulations on your baby boy.|`|HoJ1pLtraa	I doubt it unless your body is still trying to get back to normal|`|tDuMsa1daa	I doubt it very much but you are at your most fertile 3 months after giving birth.  Are you breastfeeding? give it another couple of weeks i would say before going out of ur mind :)  Speak to ur HV next time you see her
hL4XVuvIaa	take a pregnancy test. they are usually 99% accurate 2 weeks after conception, and since it's been three weeks, the test will probably be right|`|Bbn1ZSTcaa	You wouldn't be pregnant if you had sex only 3 weeks ago. You would notice signs like this if you were like 6 or 7 weeks pregnant. It is most likely your period coming. Take a home pregnancy test in about 2 weeks to be sure.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Well if the condom broke..of course there is a higher chance of pregnancy. Just wait and see if you miss your period, if you do take a pregnancy test. (Don't be 100% convinced if it says negative after the first test you take, though). Take a couple of pregnancy tests. It could either be pregnancy or just stuff due to stress. Stress does cause your period to come later than usual, or to not come at all.     Good luck|`|gO90TpqGaa	i think that you shouldnt be having sex at such an early age anyways...|`|gyoylefvaa	oooh yeah!    50% you are pregnant those look like pregnant symptoms.|`|soFpywFcaa	well the first thing you should do is take a test if you had sex 3 weeks ago it should give you an accurate reading if its positive go TO the doctor ................or it just can be the stress over thinking that you can be pregnant that is doing that to you good luck|`|rctDnhO1aa	it sounds like you are but apparently it wont show up on a test until you are like a month along unless you go to the dr maybe
xnv3NcdKaa	You can easily check your minimal health insurance rates in internet, for example here - healthplans.my-age.net|`|kNKj4uDCaa	Planned Parenthood accepts many applicants with varying degrees of insurance (if any) or they can help you find the sources you need. Congradulations and good luck!|`|7cvoxQitaa	Health department! They base it off a sliding scale. I didn't have insurance and I went through them. I paid $5 a visit, and nothing for sonograms! I had great prenatal care, I even had midwives! It was a wonderful experience. I was very blessed to have been able to go through the Health Department. Good luck! Congratulations!|`|NLjAPHx0aa	you can try aim. "access for infants and mothers" .. check it out online. good luck .. and congrats.|`|jDHBy9Cnaa	well i suggest u find a different insurance cuz all those doc visits, ultrasounds, tests is gonna be alot of money, more than u think. i know health insurance is expensive but your better off spending 300 a month versus 300 per appointment and 600 for an ultrasound. did you try healthy kids insurance?|`|ExJ0cdjxaa	YOu are not the only one who met this problem,I have met this type of  problem before.I have good experience here http://www.insuranceidea.info/free-insur...  to solve my similiar problem.
7cvoxQitaa	It could just be an irregular period. It's hasn't even been 3 months since you had you baby. Congratulations!   You can always talk to your doctor and tell them your concerns. Take a test again in a week or two, and if it's negative, it should calm you a bit!|`|AA10218110	It might be a sign of pregnancy but not sure. Take the first urine of the day (the first urine as you get up from the bed). That will give you a correct result. But you may need to wait for 30 days atleast just before the second period's date. But you can check now also with the pregnancy test strip that is available in the medical shop.
vSISVusvaa	give him a nickname. call him something he wants to be called. then he'll tell his friends, and they'll start calling him that. it'll stick as he grows older, and he'll be happy with it.|`|PCxvtwbgaa	You could give him a nickname. Something that contributes to his personality or shortening his name.|`|2mjkABpfaa	tell him when he hits highschool, people will think his name is badass|`|j7oQ1Q7caa	Hmm.. I have a son too with the same problem he's in first grade right now. He didn't like his name in knidergarten and so we gave him a nickname.Might help? He was called Marcin and now's called Mars and its got really catchie with him and everbody else. Hope that helps!|`|KCAeFaEkaa	ask him for a few names he might like and both sit down and think about which one u both like best then when u can, legally change his name to whatever you both chose|`|5NKwUZpVaa	Try giving him a nickname that he likes. (Get his input.) Then try to persuade his teachers to call him that too.|`|AA10475412	See if he likes to be called A.B which are his initials. And what type of name is Akeyen?|`|LnXeCC38aa	Yea...Tell him he dosn't understand he has a badass name.|`|TZN0v8r4aa	lol my nephew's name is spelled uniquely.  He hated the spelling though its easily understood but he claimed his mom spelled it wrong though he's spelling it way off.  He's not even spelling it the common spelling but swore that's the way his name is spelled not the way his mom named him or the common way the name is spelled.|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	let him pick  i like A K  (AK47)      how'd you come up with that name,just curious ?|`|A40jdi5Naa	i like blaze....|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Maybe you can use something that sounds similar to his name, like maybe Ian, but spell it Eyin, and when he starts his new class tell the teacher that that's what he goes by. If he likes it better they shouldn't have a problem with it. Tons of people go by short versions of their actual name. If he likes the idea I'm sure that he can even start to use it now.|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	well  he should be . parents who name there children weird names often don't think. what sounds cool for a few months often is a nightmare to the child/ person who has it for a life time. People really need to think it out before they name there child something stupid .  Akeyen Blaze is a stupid name. I would hate it too. When i turned 18 i would have it change. thanks to your so called cool name .. he will be traumatized by it... so still think it is cool?  This kid need a nick name fast ..|`|ImgouTRIaa	I have to ask , were you thinking of HIM when you chose the name? It appears you were thinking of the novelty of a new, avante-garde name, and little of the consequences thrust upon your son. If he is not big enough to shut his naysayers up regarding his name, now he must suffer out your silliness in shame and bullying. I know I had lots of fun when my mother named me Eugene, that was a real picnic. NO-BO-DY in our area named their kid that, boy, did that suck! I asked her in later years why she did that, she replied," oh, it sounded regal and stately", well, spare me regal and stately, give me something I can live with. Mike Tyson could handle Eugene or Akeyan, but not me at 5'11" and 130 lbs. Ready to rethink this?|`|nLXfeQbpaa	ask him what he wants his name to be.   If its reasonable, let his friends and teachers call him that.   He'll grow out of that eventually.
5vtVsqx6aa	I like the name too and if it helps, I automatically don't think "Jewish" when I hear it.    Go for it if you like it!  Congrats and good luck|`|CSzDV3gEaa	even among a lot of jews judah isn't too common of a name. actually it seems some of the most popular boy names among us jews is benjamin, jacob, and michael. i love the name judah and i am jewish. but i think people are starting to be more accepting and it's a strong name. i think judah would be a great name for him.|`|doLyOac0aa	What about Jude,|`|ylgNuE3uaa	Never knew anyone with that name... but I did know a Jonah which sounds pretty close. I see nothing wrong with Judah.     Sorry I wasn't more help.|`|c3uFKxH5aa	i haven't know any jews with the name judah, they have regular names just like everyone else|`|ej51eWO7aa	i havent heard of the name Judah for a non jew but maybe judah can be a middle name|`|2TrHH0rkaa	I don't know anyone personally with that name although there's a lot of people out there with it. Perhaps Jude would be a better choice although there is nothing wrong with Judah.|`|J5FSz7fgaa	sure it is so cute no matter what culture.
q5MGxuyaaa	It sounds like you are ovulating every month (because you are having monthly periods) but you could be doing so from different ovaries, which would make your periods different based on how well they were able to ovulate.  If you are concerned you aren't ovulating, check out www.fertilityfriend.com and start taking your temp every morning.  Goodluck!!
AA11399000	Wal-Mart sells a "Royal Throne" Potty that makes flushing sounds and lights up. Its real cute and it helped my daughter like to go potty!  You could also get some of those "Pee-Pee Cones" that he can use for target practice in the real toilet.  Boys usually REALLY like those! Good Luck!|`|9417ed9b3312840ef86fa973a5fa36efaa	maybe try a potty book or movie (i know "bear in the big blue house" made one). my son also has a "potty time Elmo" that seemed to work for pee. also, since his bottom is still so small, you might want to try either his own potty chair or a potty seat that sits on the toilet so he doesn't feel like he is going to fall in.|`|7AYRXhe6aa	my cousin let her child pick out his own "big boy" spiderman underwear. he never wanted to soil them so he used his potty, which he also picked btw.|`|VyAeE0Z4aa	sink the Cheerios, or you can let them water the tree out side.|`|9ce1bac9622b63a33b2c56adcaab72beaa	i trained my son at age 2 with this:  i used the cereal in the toilet/potty method...just put friut loops or cherrios in the toilet and tell him to hit the whole....reward him when he does hit the cereal, this will encourage him to want to do this everytime he feels the need to go potty, plus it wont make him scared of the toilet..most boys dont like th big bowl...good luck|`|42Frk1loaa	Create a potty chart using a poster board and markers.

They're not readily used so they're still unique withing themselves.|`|ca03c4dbfbf739cc439141f60d700173aa	Seth sounds like a hillbilly with a straw hat, dungarees and piece of grass hanging out of his mouth!  I like Josh, although it's very common at the moment. Cohen and Cole are cool and unusual. Noah is very biblical!|`|d0c89a3447d63f9735dcfa9f3fa73975aa	I love Seth!! You should name the baby what you guys want to name him, and everyone will just get over it once he's here!! Out of the other list of names, my favorite is Cole!

Cole as second choice|`|d29db9f2097b1ca8501870ff76e65fe8aa	I think names that are a bit unusual can be good sometimes, but for the most part children with unusual names get teased and made fun of. Josh is good - Cole and Cohen are a bit out of the ordinary. I like Noah but the Noah's Ark thing will get him teased. Seth sounds a bit goth-like too. I'm not saying these aren't nice names but you have to think about you're son and how his name will suit him and wether it will get him teased. I'd recommend for any other names you might think of to check that it doesn't rhyme with anything offensive or anything that could be used offensively. Josh is definetly the best out of thie list, because it's not too out of the ordinary but not so much that it's not individual. And the worst things that rhyme with it are Posh and Tosh!    Good Luck in whatever you choose, but reember, it's not just about what you like. It's about what a child, teenage or adult Seth/Cohen/Cole/Josh/Noah will like. xxx|`|767c1e59f68c8bd3f3f56e14606b4e05aa	Seth is an alright name. but i prefer Noah|`|798ab449db0380a0e94f08fbb60612d7aa	Sorry, i don't like Seth.

Ot8lxaMEaa	My son is an occasional co sleeper and crawler (8 1/2 months). If he is awake enough to roll over (I assume your baby sleeps on his back) and get on his tummy, I'm pretty sure he would have made noises and awoken you and his movement would probably wake you too. You would be surprised how sensitive you are to him while you are asleep. Good luck|`|IngripgMaa	We don't co-sleep.  But, the one time that we did (When our son was really sick) he did fall off the bed.  We also have a king size bed.  Just make a little bed for you in his room,  on the floor.|`|0437a9a5ca16bc09f111190dcbc55384aa	My daughter is 22 months old now, and I am 8 months pregnant with  2. If Madison wakes up in the night, I am too tired to sit in with her and get her to go back to sleep so I bring her in bed with us. When she was as little as yours, we co-slept some nights. (i had her strictly co-sleeping for four or five months. I was scared of SIDS) anyways, the only thing that sucked about it, was 1.) not that much room in our bed with the three of us. 2.) when she would wake up really early, that was when I got up!! 3.) she did fall off the bed twice, and only twice.... the first time, she was about four months, and the second about 6. I am a very light sleeper, so the tiniest movements from her made me wake up just to check on her. If your baby is sick, chances are, he'll feel better sleeping with mommy. And you are a mommy, and even if you start to roll over on him, your instincts will wake you up from anything bad happening... You'll be fine... trust yourself!!|`|Wc3Vge9taa	i have two kids my son (2) and my daughter (3 weeks). My son slept with me and my husband off and on intill about a month ago ever since he was a baby. Im a heavy sleeper and i never had a problem with him crawing off or rolling over him. My daughter is now sleeping in the bed with us. I know everybody says that i shouldnt let my kids sleep in m bed but i mean they sleep better when they are in bed with my husband and i.|`|PuJd9SNlaa	We never co-slept with any of our kids under the age 2.  When they were sick and still young enough to be in a crib, I would put them in a playpen next to our bed, or I would sleep in their room while they slept in their crib.  Think safety over convenience.  Too many things can go wrong, it's not worth the risk.  As long as you are in the room, that will be comfort enough for your child.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	I am assuming you have a crib right? Sidecar it to the bed and put baby on the outside. Then if he rolls he rolls into it. Just do it safely!    http://www.kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/...    GL!|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I would co-sleep with my son between my husband and I. I was always worried about my husband rolling over him so I kept my arm around the baby so my husband would hit me first if he did roll toward the baby.  And somehow I was always aware of when my son moved.  He'd constantly try to cuddle under me and I'd move closer to the edge of the bed. If I were to lay flat on my back I'd fall off.  In the mornings when my husband would get up for work he'd put pillows where he had been laying just in case the baby rolls over.  Once he started crawling, I forced myself to wake up when the baby wakes up because otherwise he'd crawl right off the bed.      If you can, position your bed so that the baby is between you and the wall so this isn't a problem.  Or buy a guard for the side of the bed.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	Do you ever roll off the bed? If you answer no to that you will not roll on your child. You body knows. My son has been sneaking into bed with me for years now and when I use to breast feed I would put him in bed with me. I would lay body pillows on one side of him and I would sleep on the other and he never crawled away he would crawl on me.|`|zwctZ812aa	My son doesn't crawl, so I don't know about that one, but I have never been concerned that I would roll over on him.  I don't sleep very deeply when he is in bed with me, and I keep him right next to me.  He likes to be touching me, so if he were to start rolling around I would notice.  If your bed is big enough, have hubby sleep in it also and put him in between you.  That way if he starts crawling, he will have to go over one of you to get out of bed and you will notice that. Good luck|`|mjlhZAVxaa	The reason I stopped co-sleeping was because my son fell off the bed one too many times.  Even though I had pillows on the floors, it doesn't really matter, we have hardwood floors.  At 8 months I had him in his crib for naps and bedtime.  Now when I try to nap with him [he is 10 months] in our room he will not have it!  He wants his bed!  And I wanted to nap and cuddle with him for the same reason, he was sick and I wanted to comfort him!  I have heard that a lot of people put their mattress on the floor, I am not able to do that.  We don't have the room and we can not move our bed frame, it is a giant sleigh bed.  I personally am glad I have my bed back and that I get to sleep with my man from now on.  It is nice to cuddle up and not have to worry about waking the baby.    Plus sex on our couch is just not comfortable!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Babies don't crawl off the edge of the bed, honestly.    They do sit with their back to the edge and fall off, and occasionally roll off when they aren't paying attention.  But they don't crawl to the edge and plunge off on purpose.  And if you are in bed I don't think you are going to sleep through your baby leaving, at least I don't.    Mom's that aren't on drugs (legal, illegal, alcohol), morbidly obese, or have sleep disorders do not roll over on their babies.  They just don't.  And at 8 months old your baby would wake you up if you did!  (Seriously have you ever heard of someone overlaying a CAT?)    Stick your bed in the corner (assuming you can do so without the frame causing a gap between mattress and wall).  Put your baby on the edge, you in the middle, and hubby on the other side.  Then you aren't kicking hubby out.  I have a Queen and a crib side car because I can't trust hubby with a baby beside him, he tosses the blankets and pillows on them.    Now its *usually* hubby, 2.5 year old, me, then baby.  But the "baby" is 15 months now so there's a lot of moving around.  And I am sure if someone tosses a blanket or pillow on anyone even the 15 month old can deal with it.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i co slept ocanisally   make sure there are no gaps bewteen the walls  but babys head above your head that way the blankets dont get thrown up in his face   use pillows sparingly   make ur hubby sleep somewere else   and i always made myself sleep on my stomach that way it was harder for me to roll over with out knowing it   and hes sick so its ok just take precautions   he might also sleep better in something that moves if thats possiable to try|`|yznZqcznaa	I have not had a baby yet so I have not co-slept however I have a friend who has a 9 months old and they co-slept since he was born.  Honestly I am surprised the baby is even alive.  I heard of two cases where she woke up to the baby breathing funny or I should say suffocating.  The one time her husbands arm was across the baby's face and the baby could not breath.  The second time was when she had the baby on her chest and he was breathing all raspy only to wake up and realize that he was face down in her chest.  Her family told me the story and my brother and everyone was acting like it was kinda funny.  I was shocked that she would still co-sleep with him.  To me it sounds so dangerous.  I know a lot of people that do it though.
VxpWziZnaa	I had preeclampsia with my first two babies.  I had the high BP and swelling in both pregnancies.  However, I had the stomach pain only in the second one.  I thought it was indigestion at first, but it starting hurting so bad I couldn't stand up straight.    You need to call your doctor now!  It can be a sign that your liver is in distress.  He can do a blood test and see if your liver enzymes are elevated.  If so, you need to have your baby right away.  But don't worry if you have your baby a little early -- I had my baby at 35 weeks and he is perfectly healthy!|`|9FbcLKsfaa	I had preeclampsia and my only symptom was blood pressure so every one is different, i would mention the stomach pains to your doctor anyway just to be safe, im sure he will appreciate and updates you have for him!|`|pnL5WTXMaa	pay close attention to any symptoms and do kick counts. don't hesitate to hound your doctor. trust me.
akB0gV20aa	They are about as accurate as you can get. Congrats.  As far as your meds...I would stay on them until you talk to your Dr. He will know best what you should be taking, and how to wean you off if thats what needs to happen.    Oh, I just re-read your question..you were asking if Lamictal can cause a positive...I know for sure it cannot!|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	omg congragulations yes blood tests are the most accurate way so ur pregnant!|`|OU9xnW86aa	The blood test picked up the pregnancy hormone...no question about that.  Congrats!!!|`|NroZQN5vaa	The blood tests are generally pretty accurate but if you want more reassurance, pick up a home pregnancy test. Congratulations!|`|98WKYtfwaa	Blood tests are very accurate when it comes to pregnancy, it measures the amount of HCG in your system.     No, your bipolar medication wouldn't make it go positive, they don't have the hormone HCG in it.     Your pregnant! Congrats!    I don't have a clue why your doctor said that taking metformin would be a good idea, it's a drug that diabetics take to control their diabetes, has nothing to do with ttc. If you have problems conceiving you should be referred to a specialist, not prescribed a drug that can be dangerous when used in wrong proportions.
Mx2hzWgTaa	i have 4 kids and with my 3 girls i love love loved the 6 month mark when their personalities started shinning through.. but with my son it was different i loved when he turned a year he was so much fun, he was always smiling always laughing and keeping me busy.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	I loved my kids when they were about 15 months old. They're still a little unsteady walking, and those little legs churning so hard when they run is sooo adorable!|`|jTM6Upm5aa	5 months ....not colicky, almost sleep through the night, smiling, portable to take around, not getting into things yet..|`|E5CnUdhsaa	my daughter is 14 months and i love this age where she does random thing its has me in stitches! but i do miss those newborn cuddley days    lloved the 7 month mark too when she was reaching all these milestones and couldnt wait for the next one:)|`|2FUjIpZKaa	I love them all.  But if I have to pick then I would pick 6 months. :)|`|RNNdRHrMaa	I have to say, I don't know.  I had bad PND so couldn't appreciate my daughter in the first year and a half of her life. I struggle now, but she is turning 3 in April, and the confidence she has, is awesome.  She is such a funny little thing, I love her to bits.  Oh and they are sponges, so watch what you say in front of them! lol|`|b10aMPdOaa	All ages for me.  Even those terrible twos and at the minutes the teenage tearaways lol!|`|2flqUgcDaa	2 so much fun|`|Mt5du1y1aa	I loved the ages from 6 months up!!  That is when the personality really kicks in!|`|nYioXmnGaa	My son is  just turning one in june  he is so cute. I am not looking forward to  Terrible twos his brother is almost there !!! HE is one and a half !!!!|`|eXnzPp4oaa	My baby is only 7 months old so not all that much has happened for me, but I cant wait for when she starts to walk. I also love 1-2 age group when they really start finding their personality.|`|iOSEVRPPaa	I'm enjoying every age.  There's no reason to be waiting for another milestone because it all happens so fast.    I am living the moement and enjoying my son as he is now.|`|pCxM717naa	Aww, yes 9mths is a cute age and they just get cuter when its your little sweetie!    In general I love the first few weeks, when they are so tiny and you can just cuddle them for ages, but with my little girl I wouldnt be able to decide. Every week I think, this is my favourite age, because there is always something new to marvel at!    Right now she is 15mths and is turning into such a little toddler! Being cute or naughty, playing little games, learning new words, talking gibberish and playing the comedian+then clapping for herself lol. So cute.x
xif22nwoaa	That sounds like the mucous plug.  I lost my plug about 6 hrs before going into labor with my first, but about 2 wks before going into labor with my second and about 10 days before going into labor with my third.  So it can vary a lot, but it does means that your cervix is changing and things are getting ready to happen.|`|8WRnqs08aa	Sounds like you may be dilating & losing your plug. Some women lose their plug a few weeks to a few hours before full blown labor begins. Walk, walk, walk & do the hanky panky; it just might help you along faster!|`|bc8a8d7595f1051b6a4ba4c3045875ddaa	can be anytime hun, might be tonight or next week, but it def wont be long try having a hot curry or going for a walk, oh and have sex too it might help start you if your getting fed up x congrats and good luck x|`|bNA5BuKCaa	That's nasty. I never that happens. Blough!|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	i hear for everyone it's different some have contractions 5 min. after losing it, some still have a few days to a week. that'd be exciting if you're about to have your baby though i havent lost mine yet and i'm 38 weeks an 3 days lol how exciting!|`|V2AML53Taa	Yeah thats ur plug.  But dont get excited cause ur plug rebuilds itself!  Just wait for the contractions!|`|NSBL9bDFaa	your mucus plug is not an indicator of labor, it can actually regenerate its self if you lose it too soon.  plus you can be like...2 centimeters dilated and still not go into labor until your due date....sucks but there really is no sure sign labor is coming...execept contractions...and even those can subside|`|1gxGih7Gaa	Definitely sounds like your mucous plug, but losing your plug doesn't mean labor is just around the corner, you could still have a few days or even weeks... Your water breaking and intense, regular contractions are the only really signs of labor... But it's a great start!!! Means your cervix is softening!! Hang in there, not too much longer!!!    Best of luck!
aWWgPkryaa	Cow's milk is fine if you are cooking with it.  I used the Annabel Karmel book and somehow had time to read it (looking back I'm not sure how I managed that!) Anyway it had loads of bits of info like that in it.|`|5Xz6lcGOaa	go for the cows milk, now your child is on solids, she/he should be having all the foods we eat, so the cows milk will do no harm.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I wouldn't cook with formula.  It has a lot of really weird qualities.  I mean, I haven't tried it, so perhaps someone who has can weigh in.  I have mixed formula into pre-cooked food instead of milk, but just before giving it to my son.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	If baby's only just starting solids, cheese sauce is really rather a sophisticated thing to be feeding him - and you're talking about tiny amounts which would be a pain to make. Once he's eating more food, and has tried both cheese and whatever flour you plan to make the sauce with, it really doesn't matter either way. I mean, both the cheese and the butter in the sauce are likely to be cows milk based anyway.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	whole milk would be better. small amount are no harm as long as its not replacing any bottles of formula:)|`|33h5R8nTaa	some cows milk is ok before a year, oh for those of u who disagree i dont care if u give me a thumbs down your just being stupid. Anyway i have given my daughter who is 7 months, we give her mash tatoes, samll things of ice cream if we have some, 3 or 4 baby spoons of it. If we make something that has milk in it we dont make it different because she will be eatting some or make it special for her.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Id use cows milk|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	I have a baby book that says you can cook with either but to be honest I wouldn't cook with formula - with all these rules about pre-preparing it and not being allowed to let it stand etc, I wouldn't trust it - especially when I make up batches of food & freeze it then warm it - if that were straight formula it wouldn't be safe so how can it be safe in cooking?    Cows milk in cooking is fine for babies - its not that cows milk is bad for babies that means they can't drink it until they are one - it simply doesn't contain the right nutrients is all.    I cook using cows milk & my little Moo loves my cheese sauce!|`|CJqK40uFaa	dont do that, i dont have any scientific back up, but that just doesn't sound good to do...|`|2flqUgcDaa	I would use cow's milk. And have done with both my children.
AA10371609	Keep complaining and don't let them tell you you're crazy.  Some women have complications that don't show up anywhere else.  Just keep telling them you've been bleeding all this time.|`|iyL6dyMyaa	The only experience I had was after intercourse, after they had confirmed I was pregnant, I started bleeding.  I freaked out because I had a miscarriage a couple of years before I got pregnant the second time, and I bled with the miscarriage.  Well I went to the ER, and they told me that it was a threatened miscarriage, but that everything was okay.  So I went on to have my son, who is 20 months old now.  If I were you I would get a second opinion, or have a different doctor look at your condition.  Or just go the ER right now, they will let you know something, then and there, rather than continue to sit there and bleed and not know what is going on!!! That's what I'd do!!!
AA11206135	sounds like maybe you over did it and the baby pinched a nerve.. Lay down for a while and see if it doesn't fix itself... (mom of five)|`|WvWFmwQoaa	I CARNT SAY IT IS NORMAL NUT IT MIGHT BE THE BABY PUSHING ON A NERVE. IF YOUR STILL WORRIED GO TO THE DOCTORS JUST TO BE SURE EVERY THING IS OK GOOD LUCK AND CONGRATS ON THE BUB|`|GrpYjwH8aa	The baby could just be pressing on a nerve.
6DSyp4ZLaa	First of all get to the bank Asap. Try to cash your check if possible. If you were to deposit it into another account at another bank, it may bounce. As far as getting quotes, try calling your older customers and asking them to refer friends to your business. At least it looks like your trying. I actually worked at an insurance office just like that when I was pregnant...It went out of business and I sat home on unemployment.. No one wants to hire a pregnant chick. As far as relaxing goes, do what you like. Lay on the couch watch a movie, read a book. Have some peace and quite. Hope everything works out!!|`|3xMQW0A6aa	my answer is simply just have control over yourself and keep your cool. try to reduce any of the factors if at all possible, reduce any stimulus that you can (lights, sounds, people, etc).  dont be afraid to walk away and take a break. and when you get home, dont think about it!!!! just relax!!!  sorry to hear you are having troubles, but only you are in control of you. good luck!|`|ostF23Omaa	I take long bubble baths or count to 10 lol. I try not to let things bother me to that point. Good Luck.|`|0R5HYKyOaa	you try to relax yourself like first stiffen your muscles then loose it out. start with your arms than back, and then neck. also take a deep breath 10 times closing your eyes, also read a book, hope i helped!!|`|3sGtibk5aa	take a nice bath when you get home from work, try relax or have some naps when you get get them, excercising helps alot aswel.   Try not to think of too many things at once, as it will stress you out.   Relax, im sure everyone is supporting you since you are pregnant.   x|`|ApdzBnx2aa	Make some time for yourself to relax, maybe go to your room and read a book, or relax and watch tv. I got stressed sometimes when I was pregnant, but you gotta keep calm for that little one inside you, no matter how hard it wil be. or maybe make a night for you and your husband to go out, just the two of you
AA11220327	very, very normal. this usually means that the baby has dropped in position to prepare for labor, and is pressing on your bowels.|`|M9ApBTYvaa	Your baby is pressing on your colon. It's normal.     Signs of impending labor are: loss of mucus plug, more braxton hicks contractions, the nesting thing where you clean your whole house and get baby's room ready and seem like you can't sit still.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	well it could be since your right about at the time of pregnancy. i think  a quick call to the dr to confirm is the best answer. good luck with your babyy :]|`|xq8Kn7Phaa	WHY YES THAT COULD BE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE YOUR LIL BUNDLE SOON THE FARTHER THE BABY GETS INTO THE BIRTH CANAL THE MORE IT PUSHED ON YOUR BOULES WHICH MAKES U HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AT 37 WEEKS YOU ARE FULL TERM AS OF NOW SO MAYBE AT UR NEXT APPT THEY SHOULD CHECK TO SEE IF U ARE DILATED OR EFFACED AT ALL    GOOD LUCK|`|AA10626484	i did that too! really big number 2's! i know how gross that is, but yes it's normal! uncomfortable and a little embarassing, but yes normal!|`|veO1RXrCaa	I get the scoots off and on.  Im 34 weeks and I guess my bowels have ramped up this pregnancy.  Last time I was constipated.  But it could be a sign labour is coming.  Wait and see I guess.  That's the bad part.  Its like you wish there was a test to let you know so you can relax and just say "O.k this means nothing.  Or this means I better pack my bag."|`|0uhRgfcsaa	same as the first gal, i started that around 37 weeks. im now a day shy of 39 weeks, still no baby :)|`|LABC73E7aa	well i experienced that when i was 37 wks and im still pregnant...
EO4AJQ8haa	I have been induced twice and neither ended in C-section. The good news is you're effaced and a little dilated. Cervical ripening makes it more likely that the induction will be successful and at this stage of your pregnancy, it's true that the gel may just be enough to get everything going.    For the last pregnancy, I was induced at 37 weeks because of complications. My waters were broken by the doctor, and after that the contractions were much stronger. At 41 weeks, your waters are more likely break on their own.     They also increased the dose slowly for me, I held off the epidural for as long as I could, but also told my doctor to tell me when it got to the stage where it was so close that it wasn't worth having anymore. She did and I had one, asked them to keep it light so that I could still feel something. It took the real pain away but I still knew when to push. So you just tell the anaesthetist to keep it light and that you still want to feel the contractions. Once the line is in, it's in, they can top it up if you need it.    No-one can guarantee of course, but it sounds like you're in a good position for induction.    Good luck to you and your baby.|`|ovgxECKsaa	Induction does not always end with a C-section.  Stay active and unless told otherwise, have lots of sex.  It really does encourage labor to start.  It's what prompted my labor with my second child.  If you don't start labor before induction, ask them to let you walk as much as possible while at the hospital to encourage your body to make things progress more quickly.  Also, put off the epidural as long as possible.  It can slow your labor.  Good Luck!|`|myEwHgI1aa	Ask them to give you the lowest dose possible of epidural.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi epidurals give you a higher chance of having a  c section so i would think about other pain relief options too.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	It takes a few minutes to get the epidural in, so when it starts to get bad, they need to start putting it in.  You don't want to do it too soon, because it can slow things down.  Inducing doesn't make you need a c-section.  They only do that if the baby's in distress or if it's been more than 24 hours since your water broke.|`|xy5UNiELaa	Once you're induced, it's really up to nature after that.  So many different scenarios are possible, especially when you add Pitocin and an epidural.  If you choose an epidural, you should be able to have it around 4-5 cm, or when you need it.  And not feeling the contractions shouldn't result in a C-section.  The nurses can monitor your contractions and tell you when to push.  If you and your baby tolerate labor well and the baby is the right size for you, then you should have no problems.  As far as length of labor, that's really up to nature also.  Pitocin can speed it up, but an epidural can slow it down.  You just never know.  It's worth a try though.  Congrats and good luck!|`|zIPLhbozaa	Having the epidural too soon can result in major delays in the birthing process. One women I know got the epidural and it stalled her labor for 13 hours!! Women have been having babies without epidurals since the beginning of time. You can do it too. But if you need the epidural, eventually, you will have a child to show for all you go through. So either way, it's really just up to you. I would talk to the doctor about other medication alternatives if you're concerned and want to avoid a c-section as much as possible. There are drugs that can make you more comfortable without taking away your ability to dilate or push.     I'm reading 'What to Expect When You're Expecting'. It has a whole section that talks in detail about all the drugs modernly used.     Best wishes and congrats!|`|hJX6Ur3taa	I was induced at 38 weeks.  I went in the afternoon before and they give me a pill to get me ready.  My water broke in the middle of the night.  They started me on Pitocin at 5:00.  I had my daughter at 10:28.  I had them do an epidural, but it didn't take.  You have to wait until your saline bag is empty.  I didn't want to try again.  If you try to relax your lower part of your body as much as possible, it helps the baby to move down the canal easier. I'm glad that the epidural didn't take.  I had that baby in my arms after 5 pushes.  I wouldn't change a thing.|`|dMHeBSkpaa	I have been induced and had epi's for both of pregnancies. Believe me...even if you have an epidural you will be able to feel when it is time to push. The bad pain is gone, but the you can still feel the pressure of needing to push. That does not go away. I had both of my girls out with 3 pushes so I don't see where the epidural changed any of that. I will once again be getting an epidural with this baby, because there is no reason to go through all that pain when they have medicine to help you. I don't know if it is more painful with induction than natural birth, because I have been induced for all my pregnancies, but with induction you will definately want the epidural!! Good Luck!! :)
Ohsqy2xoaa	how thin the cervix is|`|AA10186411	Effaced is when the cervix thins out.
QvrhmdAtaa	You should just do the family and close friends thing. I had 5 children and it was always the best financially and most memorable way to go.Besides the cake and Ice cream,make it a pot luck that you coordinate so everyone brings a dish so all the food groups are included,you know,chips,dips,drinks,burgers/buns,hot dogs/buns,condiments/side dishes.BBQ at the park and take some pics too.We always had the few people with children who were closest to us to make it a little more party like as well. Staying on budget is always best when you're raising children because of all the unseen things they require. You and those who you love are always the ones to have at these kind of first years events anyway.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	If you have a printer, then find a site online to print your own. It's a bit cheaper. I made my daughter's invitations. I put 4 pictures of her (birth, 3, 6, and 9 months.) with just a simple invite. Make your own cake. If you want to get a little fancy with it, here are some adorable easy recipes:  http://www.nickjr.com/party/cake_finder/...   Skip decorations, they won't remember them. Get a cheap table cloth to put under his chair while he eats the cake for easy clean up. Depending on how limited your budget is set the time so that it wouldn't be during a meal (say 1:30-3:30) and just serve snacky foods. Homemade tea or kool-aid are the cheapest route to go beverage wise.   The most important part is to have lots of fun and take lots of pictures.|`|NroZQN5vaa	I am also a mom on a budget. I'm making a pumpkin cake because my daughter loves pumpkin and it looks really easy to make, we're putting out chips and salsa and guacamole and some other finger foods. We're just planning on have people over for about an hour or two in the middle of the afternoon and that's it. No decorations, since she won't remember.|`|DO3zDMataa	OK do this get a list of food and drinks,snacks or sweets.get a few friends with kids similar in age.family of course.ask to use someones house or yours,if the room is there.get into the festivity,like his first Christmas he will turn 1 once lol!! but serious it is your son and a big deal so don't worry about other peoples drama(if u want to call it that) you do what is best 4 u!! and lil one. but yeah do a small get together,friends family. OH the park also is good depending on the weather. but good luck you'll get it.i hope i helped. but wait till he is walking and talking to do the big stuff.|`|j7Mxfr1yaa	i had a family dinner followed by opening of presents and then cake... it was way fun walmart has a huge table cover in themes i chose spiderman and i just put it on my kitchen floor where he had his cake for a super easy clean up the cover cost like a doller or two and then a bag of potatoes is only like two or three dolars just get a couple of cans of a vegie for a couple bucks and so far its under 15 dollars you could buy a few things ahead of time like the cake mix and the decor spread it out through paychecks so your not blowing it all in one pop...     good luck and have a good party it will be one you definately will remember for the rest of your life...|`|l4mMBe5Aaa	We, too, are just having a small gathering of family members at our house (our daughter's birthday is this Saturday!).  We are having it in the afternoon (after her nap!), and just having some appetizer type foods, nothing fancy.  We ARE, however, doing decorations - I KNOW that my daughter is going to love the balloons (we just got a package of 25 balloons that we are going to blow up ourselves and hang, as well as leave some on the floor for her to play with).  I figure everyone will eat, she'll open her gifts, and then have cake.  Nothing fancy, just a good time for our family members to get together to celebrate our daughter's first year of life!      Also, for decorations, we are using some of our white Christmas lights, along with the $2.99 balloons, and I made some birthday banners out of some cute scrapbook paper I had.  I also bought fabric in coordinating colors off of the clearance rack at the fabric store ($1.99 bought me enough fabric to cover our table with a pretty cloth instead of plastic, and all I had to do was hem one edge...  Actually, I haven't hemmed it yet, and I may just leave it!)|`|Z4JzziLXaa	A baby's first birthday is more for the parents than the baby. a small family get-together will do just fine. He won't remember it, but you will. Just remember to take pictures|`|VueZ5u9Waa	I'm not making a huge to-do of my son's first birthday as he won't remember it or appreciate it! I'm not even doing a theme really, just some cute, decorations (that my mother in law got). I'm not even inviting many people because I don't want to throw him off by too many strange people. I want him to have fun and be happy. I'm baking him a cake myself, so I won't be spending much at all!
X0xHXDcTaa	They told me the same thing with my first child! My blood work was off VERY little, but they suggested there could be a problem. They wanted to do an amniocentesis. I don't recommend one, especially if you are going to love your baby no matter what is wrong with it! Just let God handle it. Amnios can be dangerous to the baby! I am sure everything is fine!|`|Ud871v3paa	A lot of times the blood tests are false positives thats why most birthing classes suggest you not get them because they will drive you insane.   My friend got a false positive and almost aborted the baby because her husband already had one child with DS, luckily she didn't and her baby did not have DS.  So I wouldn't worry too much about it, sounds like the odds are definantly with not having DS but no matter what you're going to have a beautiful baby so congrats!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	It means the odds are definitely in your favor.|`|winmjHAmaa	Don't worry over it, okay sweetie.  Imagine there are 4,526 who played the lottery and you were one of them.  Your chances are 1 in 4, 526 that you are going to win.  So, don't worry.
DgmDfwxDaa	The doctor is starting you out on pitocin because that is the medicine that gets the uterus to start contractions. Generally, it takes 12 hours until the baby is delivered. Sometimes you can go over the 12 hour mark. It took 13 hrs 49 minutes from the start of the pitocin until the baby was delivered. I would continue to check your sugar for sure, in case you have a fluctuation. The best thing to do to get prepared is to get plenty of sleep the night before and just relax as much as possible, it helps during labor.|`|yB5go5wbaa	I'm being induced tomorrow morning and I don't know the answers to your questions, but I just wanted to say goooood luckkkkkk!|`|iMULlxdgaa	It probably take about 12 hours to fully dialate and efface you especially if your not there yet.  It would be pretty crazy if you went from 0 to 10 in a matter of minutes so I guess they gradually induce you.  I had pitocen for my first and it seemed like it didn't really take that long but I might have alreayd been dialated.|`|52U22fiAaa	They will put you on a pitocin IV drip, and you will have to remain hydrated to keep the baby's heartrate in check.  Contractions will be very strong at which time you will decide if you want an epidural or not.  Women dilate at different rates though, you might dilate in a few hours or in 24 hours.  I was in labor for 30 hours so anything could happen.  Other than that though, it should be fine!  good luck!|`|75zggy81aa	They enduced me at 9am and i had my baby at 5:40! i was only dialated at a one when i went it. The pitocin works fast and it hurts! I didn't have GD so i never had my sugar checked. Congrats ahead of time. I liked being induced because it seems like the nurses watch you more closely, its quick too!|`|weO1J2Eaaa	when they induce you and start u on the pitocin it doesnt take that long for you to dialate. i was induced andi was in labor for about 7 hours. they just stick this tube in you to bust your bag of water and the medicine just makes you dialate. its not a great feeling but hey think of the GREAT outcome. i would just enjoy these last couple of days u have of peace and quiet and let the doctors check everything else. but you have no worries. you wil be fine  CONGRATS|`|aba81bf0dd1e368904161a0c15faf44caa	Okay, here is the time line they had me on.    Check in to hospitla at 9:00 PM.  Start Cervidil at 11:00.  Cervidil stays in until 6:00 AM.  At 6:30 AM start Pitocin.  Contractions begin.  At 10:30 AM I was 4 cm dilated.  Got epidural at 10:30 AM.  At 2:15 PM I was ready to push.  At 2:21 PM, son was born :-)    I was so clueless about the timeframe.  Hope this helps you some.    If you are already somewhat dilated and effaced, they will probably skip the cervidil, so that will cut 6 hours off your labor more or less.|`|O117gwkUaa	There isn't much to being induced except the pitocin which is the drug that makes you go into labor of course they constantly are checking you, that's normal with any delivery.  And yes it will take at least that long if not longer to fully dilate.  I was induced at 37 weeks.... didn't have my daughter until 16 hours after they started pitocin. As for the GB and sugar's cant tell you that I was induced for preeclampsia.
75zggy81aa	google subchronic bleeding- there are tons of sites to help you. but before you freak out- take a pregnancy test. i bet you are having your period, its not all that likely to conceive right after you start trying. If you DO get a positive result call an OB and tell them right away when you make an appointment what is happening so they get you in right away or send you to emergency!|`|3XFZHhWgaa	Im not sure exaclty what you are having...You could be having an early form of miscarriage called chemical pregnancy....or you could be one of those women who bleed during pregnancy and are totally fine as well as the baby. Take a test or call the doctor. They would know best and good luck!|`|IllWKAUGaa	why havent you taken a pregnancy test? it could just be random spotting or something and the bright red is your period....the timing seems right...you need to take a test, if you are bleeding bright red it could be a miscarraige.|`|RZr1Esi4aa	that was probably your period,you probably wernt pregnant seen as u never did a test|`|NLxCpn8iaa	Yes, have heard of bleeding in the first trimester, but really you should go in.  you may have an ectopic pregnancy or early miscarriage... Definitely don't wait to be seen by a doctor.
myEwHgI1aa	If there is pressure in your back, then you can time them. It is completely normal to get BH at this stage of pregnancy, and sometimes they get kinda regular for a little while. Just wait it out until you have pressure in your lower back- that is a real one.|`|no9N3zjMaa	Some women find them mild and tolerable, but they are usually conscious that something is happening. More typically, in my experience, a first time mother will notice contractions and think "this is it!" when actually she may be in early labor or even having a false alarm. For most first time mothers, active labor contractions are surprisingly intense.    http://www.drspock.com/faq/0,1511,23769,...    you'll know!! I've had a few days of real contraction that have just stoped and man does it hurt, You can't walk you can't talk!!
Jn1ZfBxlaa	I wouldn't get to upset just yet. They schedule your first prenatal between 8-10 weeks because sometimes it takes longer than others for the heartbeat to show up. If your hormones are normal and your baby is the right size, more than likely he/she is ok. Just take it easy until your next ultrasound and hope for the best. Good luck!|`|QYSsvqXyaa	Do some blogging research about others who have not herd the heart beat... I feel for you :( Good luck|`|7yd7lNU7aa	i just went to the Dr. at a little over 9 weeks and they said i probably will not hear a heartbeat and that women rarely do that early. It is a possibility to have miscarried and not feel anything. I wish you the best!|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I know it's hard but try not to worry until the next one. Stress will only make your situation worse or make you think there are symptoms there that really aren't causing you more fear. Sometimes that early on it's harder to see. Good luck and I hope everything is fine.|`|X0xHXDcTaa	I have, but my story doesn't have a happy ending, sorry! By 7 weeks a fetal heart beat should be easy to find. By 9 weeks the chances are higher. I had the same thing happen last summer. I didn't have any bleeding until about what they think was 8 weeks after I had miscarried. I didn't actually complete my miscarriage til 10 weeks after I had lost the baby. At first my hormone levels were very high also and I still had all my pregnancy symptoms. However, I have talked to people who have experienced this and the baby was fine!! So I will pray that your little angel is fine!! :) God Bless!|`|CG5L6Fm6aa	a miss miscarried to me|`|xy5UNiELaa	There is a possibility of having a missed miscarriage, where you don't bleed.  However, they are rare.  It could also take some time for tissue to be expelled.  Sorry, I know it sounds harsh.  I pray that your next appt. turns out well.  Good luck and God bless.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	They MAY have missed the heartbeat - as its still pretty early.    All you can do is wait to see what your next ultrasound shows.    Stay strong|`|Coc593Ikaa	The doctors are unsure, so don't give up yet! Google "missed miscarriage". In this kind of miscarriage, the baby dies, but your body does not immediately expel it. What the doctors are doing now is looking back in a week to see if the baby grows and what happens with your HCG levels. Sometimes, early on, they have a problem detecting the heartbeat, so it is too soon to say. You (unfortunately) have to wait to see if the baby grows or not.|`|ff32225b284101d05a2982908b6b5febaa	sometimes the body doesn't automatically pass the baby....they have to remove it. Sorry  btw tho..I know someone who was told she would miscarry her baby and she decided to wait it out and she now has a 2 year old..healthy....have faith...but please prepare youself
xSfgrdFJaa	there are medical and surgical abortions. Medical ones involve taking a pill to make the foetus come out, these are offered up to 12 weeks, after that a surgical one is done under anaesthetic and the foetus is removed by suction. Most women choose surgical as you dont have to see anything, and they are offered before 12 weeks also. If your thinking about having one speak to your doctor and they will go through it with you.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	no where i live they only do medical abortions up to 9 weeks they said if they checked me on teh day of my appt. and i was anything more than that they wouldn't do it an i would have to get scheduled for a surgical abortion where they stick a metal rod up there and rip out the baby and pregnancy. ugh i couldn't do it i left.|`|OHnQ7pn0aa	there's the pill method. they give you these pills to take orally and then they give you like 4pills to insert vaginally when you get home. it takes about 6hours for you to miscarry. you have to be within a certain amount of weeks tho to get this procedure done or else they have to do the surgical procedure which i heard is really pain full. you bleed for like 3weeks when you do the pill method abortion and you cramp like your on your period.|`|N89HLv92aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEBAJfxf_...    Here is a graphic video if that helps
pXSKSS3daa	Try some finger foods, you may be surprised.    Teeth have little to do with it because babies chew with what would be their molars. Most don't get these until over the age of one, anyway. Just steam up some veggies or fruits so they are very soft and see what he does with them.    As long as he is still taking in a good amount of nursing sessions/formula then I wouldn't be too terribly concerned.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Noah's Mommy is right.  He doesn't need teeth for finger foods.  He DOES need the ability to pick up food and self feed, and at 6 months he may be a bit young  yet for that.    So... if he wont' eat babyfood and can't eat table foods -- don't worry about it.  he still doesn't really need solids, so just give him his milk.  You could try offering purees every few days (don't push, just offer) and see if he gets interested again.  If not ... he'll be fine on milk alone until he IS able to self-feed.|`|nbSp469Waa	Have you tried other baby foods.  I also have a 6 month old, and if I don't change up her foods, she will do what your son is doing, and spit it out.  I just made her blueberries and apples the other day and she loves them, I also just made her spinach, peas, and sweet potatoes, she loves them all.  But her all time fav is the vanilla custard with bananas.
Ojgqd4xNaa	You can start at 3 months, and with good head control!  My little girl loves it now, and will sit in it for like 20 minutes, but when I first started, at 3 months, she got tired really easy, and could only go in for like 5 minutes.  She now 4 months, and I put her in it with the tray on it, and give her some toys!  She loves trying to pick them up, though she can get frustrated!  It's great to sit her in there, when I'm trying to do my make-up, and get ready.  But never leave them unattended, keep them on the floor, there have been a lot of reports of babies flipping out of them on high surfaces, and getting hurt!    ADD*  If you have a bigger, and stronger baby, you can probubly use them at a younger age, but the box says three months!  My little girl was, and still is a peanut, so any younger, and she would have been to wobbly, and they cna get hurt if they wobble back and forth too much!  Their necks still aren't very strong!!|`|EHY3FnAmaa	We have a bumbo for my 4 month old son.  He loves it.  The box says age 3 months and up.  But I would say its depending on the baby how well they can hold there head upright!|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	I'm glad you asked this cause I want to know too. My baby is 3 months and holds her head up good and can sit well assisted, so I wanna try one. I think it's when they can hold their head up really well, but I'm curious to see everyone's answers.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	My son has good head control and I've been using one for a couple weeks now ( he's 10 weeks).  I always sit with him since he is so younfand we just use it to play.  I started using it because he is getting a flat spot in the back of his head.  He doesn't sleep with his head turnedto the side so I want to keep him off the back of his head as much as I can when he is not sleeping.  It took  a couple of trys before he liked it.
MtrvRNj9aa	My son is on Alimentum as well, and there is no generic equilivant to it. Trust me, I've looked up and down and it does not exist. Try going to WIC, they usually will give you an extra can if you go there and say you ran out before next months checks, they have done that for me. Also, try your local Craigslist.com That is a good place where you can usually get that or Enfamil Nutramagin (same thing but Enfamil brand).|`|AA11210211	Walmart has the Parent's Choice brand,it is pretty good I used it for my daughter while we were off WIC for a couple months.|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	As far as I know there is no generic equivalent to Alimentum.   I know the wasen't when my son was diganosed with a milk allergy and would not drink the Nutramigen. we tried to find a generic  hypoallergenic formula and there was none.|`|7EzmV1t8aa	Target makes "Target" brand and they are as good as Similac or Enfamil!|`|PuJd9SNlaa	Take the label from the Similac can and compare ingredients list with the generic labels.  You should be able to find something comparable.|`|SPVt85Hyaa	Commercial infant formula contains melamine, an industrial chemical used in the manufacture of can liners, flame retardant, cleaning products, fertilizers and pesticides.  Please select an organic formula like Earth's Best if you are going to formula feed.
JnLoHaoAaa	I did it once in a while. A lot of times it's not very hard at all. You coud take an hour or two each week to boil and mash different fruits, veggies, pastas, etc., store them in plastic containers and freeze or refridgerate them until you need to use them. Some good foods to do this with are sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, peaches, spaghetti, green beans, peas, carrots, bananas, and whatever else you come across that you can use|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	I stuck with it.  It isn't too much of a hassle.  It really doesn't take much time at all and once you get your system down, it is a breeze.  I always made enough to freeze, so it would last quite awhile.  At 16 months, he hasn't eaten purees for quite awhile, but I still make batches of things (chicken pot pies, baby hot pockets, mini quiches, etc.) that I can freeze and pop in the microwave for a quick lunch or dinner.|`|4MjSgjAAaa	its not a hassle just puree down the stuff you are eating if it is suitable for him/her that's what i do and then you can freeze it and use it for days when you can't be bothered cooking i did still use baby jars when i was going out as it was alot easier|`|AA11920812	I did it with both my kids. All I did was take what we were having for dinner and put it in a little cuisinart food processor. I added water until I got the desired consistancy. It`s really easy and it teaches them to eat your cooking and have a wide variety of foods.    It also got me cooking healthier. And, planning meals in advance. I`d say after the first month I didn`t even think about it any more.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	it;s fun to do and you know exactly whats going into it, however i never saved much money buy doing it, maybe an extra 5 dollars a month if that. but it is fun|`|yCwPxulYaa	I am doing it with my baby.  It really isn't that much of a hassle.  Of course it is a little more difficult then opening a jar and feeding the baby, but I have actually enjoyed experimenting with it.    This is a great website that I have found to be very helpful.  http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	I wanted to but didn't.  I just recently got a magic bullet and that would have worked perfectly!|`|buatfIuiaa	With my twins I never made their food. I mean if we had mashed potatoes or something I would give that to them, but for the most part they ate store bought baby food. My sister in law on the other hand made all of my nephews baby food. Poor baby, all he ever ate was re-fried beans and bananas.....|`|627pWyVkaa	I think it would depend if its going to save you money and trips to the grocery store and if you can make it in bulk and freeze them or leave them like preserves, or like baby food can stay on the shelves unopened, then it may be a good idea for you and if you can find the time! It might be better if you have like a little vegetable and fruit garden, But i think it might be more expensive, Im not really sure, probably way more healthier though!|`|W0gMQVoDaa	yes for me it was fine when i cooked a roast dinner a few times a week i would blend it up and put small pots of it in the freezer and once a week i would stew apples and other fruit  and freeze pots of that,hope this helps,congratulations and take care xx|`|jN3pRKkEaa	I am almost 38w and thinking the same.    Here is the advice I got - go to the store, buy a whole bunch of veggies and fruits, whatever you plan to use, get a variety.      Steam the veggies then blend them in the blender (all separate, like do all the green beans, then do all the broccoli,etc..) and then blend the fruit.  Fill up ice cube trays w/ the mashed veggies/fruits.  Each cube is about a serving.  Put them in marked freezer bags.  Each nite just set the food you plan to use the next day out on the counter in a little container (get the little tupperware cups from the store) and they are ready to use the next day.      The problem I forsee the first time doing this is not using a lot of the stuff I make cuz the baby might not like some things.  But it sounds like once you get the swing of things, know your baby's likes and dislikes, you would only have to make food every 1-2 months.|`|bDuWUBTyaa	It really is easy... especially if you have a couple of extra hours on Sunday or someone to watch the baby (like a supportive husband).    Now your next task is to look into cloth diapering :)
zwctZ812aa	Our sons are about the same age, I've noticed through our questions they're hitting milestones at the same time lol.  I just bought him a bumbo seat yesterday and put him in it for the first time last night.  He has reflux and LOVES it.  He sat in it all smiles watching his Baby Einstein  video this morning.  I think it does help them feel better to be sat upright as long as you don't leave him in it for real long periods of time.|`|rAkWoweOaa	4 months is when I used it, but only because that is when I got it.|`|KHbqfLRUaa	We bought one for our son when he started eating baby food at 4 months.  If your son likes sitting up, I would definitely give it a try.  We didn't have to deal with reflux (thank goodness), but if it gives him any relief I would say go for it.  Just pay attention to his cues - he'll let you know if he likes it!|`|yCwPxulYaa	I started putting my baby in her bumbo at 8 weeks.    http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a237/A...    This is her the first time in her bumbo. She also loves to be sat up.  As long as he has good head control then he should be good to go.      $20.00 is a great price for a bumbo too!!|`|bd023cea955952a6366f0a9965ea13caaa	I just got my daughter one over the weekend. The first two times I put her in it, she cried, but now she likes to sit in it for a little bit. I have noticed that once I sit her in there she burps and the second time I put her in it, she kind of spit up/vomited, so I have been careful about sitting her in it. She will be 4 months old next Monday. She has excellent head control, but of  course she is not used to sitting upright like that. She has to be close to me though, or else she freaks out. I am not sure if she is just a mommy's girl or if she is scared to be in it without me really close to her.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I started using mine at 2 months because my son has excellent head control.  He's 10 weeks now.  I don't leave his side when he's in it because he's so young, but I had to do something because he was developing a flat spot andcarrying him around in the baby bjorn got boring for him after awhile.  The bumbo allows us to interact face to face without my son having pressure on the back of his head.|`|7XuzRloXaa	I started putting my daughter in it around 3 1/2 months, she loved it, still does!! She thinks she's such a big girl in it. After awhile tho, with all her leaning forwards, it starts hurting her tummy, and she gets fussy. But I think it's great for babies. She's pretty much sitting up with very little support now at 5 months, so I really believe the bumbo chair has helped with that!|`|7eHoSOFTaa	I am a nursery nurse and we put babies in the bumbo as young as 3 months, if their is too much space for them to wriggle around we kind of stuff a blanket in to even out the spaces and so as the baby is comfortable. I'd say use it up until about 10 months or when your baby starts crawling as when they are crawling it is easy for babys to get out of the bumbo. :) x|`|Mt5du1y1aa	about three months|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I started my daughter at 3 months!  She was go with her head, but she did get tired easily, so I only put her in it for a few minutes to start!  Give it a try, if his head stay up good, and he likes it then let him stay in it, but when he fusses of if his head is too wobbly, he's not ready!    If you look closely at my avatar, it's a pic of my little girl who'll be 4 months old on the 7th, sitting in her Bumbo!  She loves it now, especially if I attach the tray, and put some toys on it!  She sends them flying trying tp pick them up!
bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	Yes it is normal. Tell your partner this will make you feel better.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	u'll go through all kinds of emotions during ur first trimester, this is the time when ur hormones will kick in big time. i went from happy, to depressed, even hated it when the baby moved for the first time, sometimes i even thought i should've done an abortion bc i felt like now my life is over. i always thought i was a bad mother bc of those thoughts, but thankfully i had my b/f to comfort me, he read that a lot of women go through depression and all. after couple of days of the baby kicking i started to actually like it, now i can't get enough. so don't worry bout the way u feel, not every woman is as happy as they make it seem during the beginning of the pregnancy, especially if it's ur first, cuz ur life is bout to change completely and the thought of it is pretty scary.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	o hunny that's completely normal , but exciting that you're happy about it i remember i was terrified. dont be too scared to tell everyone though they usually react a lot better than you first assume they will. good luck!|`|GpR5MI5raa	i think every pregnant woman feels like that at some point. its kind of a big deal. just keep it cool. Maybe telling your partner will be reassuring for you.
HXfHkoSHaa	I thought I was done with stretch marks after the first go around.  I was way wrong, but then again, my second weighed over ten pounds.  I may not be the norm.|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	Yeah just make sure you oil up and you should be fine.|`|IkkYOehSaa	I got all my stretch marks the first time around (there was alot!) and the 2nd and 3rd times I got nothing. To be kinda gross. My body had already stretched all that it needed to. Also I didn't really go on any diets between kids didn't see the point of dieting just to have another kid.  But thats just me.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	i only got a couple of first time and i never used anything then second time round i used bio oil and then  i got a few more than the first time.|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	It depends on the woman I got them the first time not bad and not the second now my friend got them bad both times. As for preventing not much besides staying hydrated|`|nKXTjqQWaa	Most likely yes.

So don't worry about the red seedy poop.|`|AA10458620	just might get the runs. that's about it. my kids eat strawberries like crazy.|`|AA12127500	She might get overly full and get sick. I would put a limit on it. Strawberry puke probably isn't pleasant.|`|b7acd033beb681b7e86e3663bfacbad6aa	it could really upset her stomach, strawberries are really acidic.|`|fc5aa01af14d4edde16a2a5a7942606baa	She may get a tummy ache but as long as she has no allergy to strawberries than there is no real danger.

54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	If your doctor isnt concerned then you shouldnt be either. I am 34 weeks pregnant and have gained 24lbs so we are pretty close in weight gain and my midwife is very happy with my gain. They say to gain around 25-30lbs if you are normal weight a little more than that if you are underweight and a little less if you are overweight. So it sounds to me like you are doing just fine. Dont worry about what your friend says as long as your doctor is happy with your gain. Good luck.|`|4AO2myzKaa	Wow, your friend is really wrong!  25-35 lbs is perfect weight gain for your size!|`|DNygQdmVaa	the average weight gain is 25-35 pounds.  so thats normal. I had gained 26 pounds by 23 weeks.|`|ZdeJCdCbaa	weight gain is ok but you have to be careful because of high blood pressure plus it is harder to loose after you have your baby. when i had my first i gained 75 lbs. NOT ON PURPOSE! i had high blood pressure and its been 2 years and im still trying to loose it all. Try to be more active and the saying "eating for two" isn't really true. your baby will get its nutrition from whatever you eat. Watch out for sugars like soda and candy. And look at the foods you eat, if its processed its not good for you. Concentrate on your fresh fruit and veggies.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Normal pregnancy weight gain for you should be around 25-40 lbs total. Don't stress if you go over it a little. As long as you don't show signs of preeclampsia, and your doctor isn't concerned.. then you shouldn't be either. Not every pregnancy is the same and not every woman will gain the same amounts. And not every woman is a doctor that knows how much each person should gain. So my advice is to not worry if you go over it, and if you have issues, ask your doc.|`|P37lIBr2aa	In your last trimester they estimate you should be gaining almost a pound a week so I'd say you were okay. Talk to your doctor about it if you are still concerned. I'm sure he'd bring it up if he was worried though.|`|qhINFhGEaa	you are right on track! for your size ( and mine too! : ) ) you should be gaining about 25 to 35 lbs.  And depending on your body mass index (  I was about one point on the low side) possibly up to 40 lbs.    At 33 weeks pregnant you should be gaining about a pound to 2 lbs a weeks.     You are doing a great job! Keep it up!

So cute!|`|3gXQPso5aa	everything, every milestone both of them cross I am so proud even of the little things like my daughter (21months) saying a new word or my son (6 weeks) holding his head up and smiling everything they do makes me proud!|`|JP2h62qiaa	When he says "please and Thank you" at 14 months old.

(she makes her daddy proud by letting out some pretty good toots! If we're out in public they look at him and assume he did it! I must admit, I'm proud of her for that, too ;)|`|5YPSyP91aa	sometimes he has a large erection during diaper changes.|`|AA11476782	She sits up.

So he is giggling more rolling over to one side more and lifting his head more and higher.  So I guess I am proud about those things.|`|jgDlkSiWaa	She was saying "da-da"earlier and I said that daddy went bye bye and she waved!   She also started walking on Monday!   Time goes by so fast!
VxpWziZnaa	Protein in the urine indicates that there is some damage (most likely reversible) to the filtering areas (glomerulus) within the kidney.  This allows protein to escape from the blood plasma into the urine.    Protein in the urine is not by itself an indicator of preeclamsia.  However, if you have proteinuria along with high blood pressure and whole-body fluid retention (not just legs), you may have preeclampsia.    Your doctor is correct in monitoring the situation.  He will be watching for any other developments that could signal preeclampsia.    Added:  I guess we were all thinking proteinuria because you mentioned that you were pregnant (testing for protein in the urine is done at every visit) and you had a 24 hr. urine test.    OK, so excess protein in the blood is a different matter.  The blood normally contains many types of plasma proteins; most notably albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen.  However, all the proteins combined are only 8% of the blood by weight.    High blood protein levels are not caused by a high protein diet.  But it can be caused by chronic inflammation, infection, or some diseases of the bone marrow.  Your doctor can run tests to find out what is causing the excess protein.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Read this:  http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/pregnanc...|`|3dSCbIcEaa	when u spill protien in your pee it is a sign that your body is not getting enough protein, and that with high blood pressure could lead to serious health issues.|`|iXt3erseaa	Well too much of anything is a bad thing, but if the doctor isn't worried, then you shouldn't be either.|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Protein in urine during pregnancy is one component of Preeclampsia.  Can be extremely serious.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Too much protein in your urine is a bad thing. That's one of the signs of pre-eclampsia. I had to do 9 of those 24 hour tests to keep track of my protein. It's got to be pretty elevated for it to be much of a concern but it is something to keep an eye on.    This one briefly talks about high protein levels in blood. Make sure you up your fluid intake as well.   http://www.valleyhealth.com/Health_Libra...|`|myEwHgI1aa	Um, too much protein in your urine IS bad. You really should be eating much more protein for your health. They are looking to see if you have preeclampsia, which means they will most likely induce you.|`|ff32225b284101d05a2982908b6b5febaa	I think it means a UTI? Or possibly gestational diabetes|`|TCwf6HXNaa	no its not. portien is good for bones. yu baby will be strong|`|fSX8Ie7caa	if the doctor thinks it's fine it probably is, but be extra careful (especially cause you pregnant)|`|AJcwSWf1aa	A lot of protein in your urine could be a sign of a UTI or bladder infection. Some people have a little bit more protein. Nothing to be concerned about unless you are uncomfortable when you urinate, like itching or burning.|`|A5CX7n3Caa	he's just checking the protein levels in your urine to make sure that your kidney's are doing their job, because pregnancy can create stress on normal body function he may just want to be sure, also if you had high blood pressure one or more of your visits he would also check their function.|`|mQhSxCpoaa	Actually too much protein in your urine is not a very good thing at all.   Some woman have something that can start as early as 20 weeks called preeclampsia. It can become a very serious condition depending on how far along you are.   It is usually characterized by headaches, sometimes severe edema in your extremities or your face, and most importantly a heightened blood pressure that can be pretty serious.   If you have it late enough then they may decide to induce you so that you do not run the risk of having complications from the high blood pressure including seizures.  I had this problem around 34 or 35 weeks and they induced me around 37 weeks. It just depends on how far along you are, how high your blood pressure is running (120/80 is average by the way although every one varies), and if the disease develops into Toxima which is more dangerous.
xif22nwoaa	I only bathed my babies about 3 times a week because they all have dry skin.  Babies really don't need more than that if you are taking care to clean them during diaper changes and after bottles/feedings (if they dribble).    But some people use a nightly bath as part of the bedtime routine to help calm the baby.|`|AA11920812	Depends on the baby. My first got a bath twice a week (ecezema) my youngest at least twice a day (GERD). I found this great stuff by Mustela  that is a soapless bath solution. Basically you use a wash rag and just apply this solution. It`s called PhiseoBebe. Wonderful stuff when you have a reflux baby that always smells like puke :)    And, a great solution when you are in a time crunch. It`s pricey but you will love it I promise!|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I think we gave our daughter a bath every other day or every other 3 days. At that age they don't get very messy unless they have a huge blowout diaper or spit-up a lot. I think I would put lotion on my baby every day|`|zLVZyfwUaa	I used to bathe my daughter every night as part of her bedtime ritual, after I would give her a massage with lotion.  I didn't use soap unless she really needed it.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I give my 10 week old a bath every 2-3 days, unless a specific spit up or extra stinky diaper dictates otherwise.|`|BsRMGbCDaa	i washed my baby when ever she she went on her self and it went up her back or something, but you should wash them every other day but if you dont feel they are clean wipe them down with a baby wipe in the evening and rub them down in lotion.|`|eu6UQElYaa	2 or 3 times a week so you don't dry out their skin.|`|Grmsgziaaa	My daughter is 6 weeks and gets one every single day. I dont like to but my MIL insists and my doctor tells me to. I dont really agree too much though. I was going to ask this today actually. Anyways I put ltion oon her everyday after a bath, if she didnt get her bath I dont put on lotion.
nCKdkYSyaa	Yes it can still be too soon, My period isnt due until the 10th and I also got negative readings, today, and the 2 days beforehand. lol and im soo ready to have my answer! But i just ran across my daughters pregnancy and baby book and it said the dates i took my tests with her and I took one 3 days before my period and it was negative and then 2 days AFTER and it was positive. So I would just wait a couple more days and not give up just yet :)|`|TcuL9XOWaa	It can be too soon.  I think you might just have to wait and take another test.|`|dZsihjoYaa	depends what type of test u dooo, most only show up on the day or one day before you period and then after that|`|AA11609300	Wait 2 more days and try again.  If it is still BFN, try on Wednesday.  I totally know the waiting is brutal.  Good luck and baby dust!|`|q4WtQvSZaa	You'd only get a positive on a test that early if you'd implanted early and it was a very sensitive test.  I know its hard but to be sure you'll have to wait until your period is due (this doesn't stop me testing early most months though!)|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Far too soon- wait until Tuesday and test again.
AA11380378	Hi Bubs,    They did mine at 8 weeks to confirm pregnancy and due date. They did the next one at 13 weeks for the fisrt trimester screening and they willeschedule me for the third one at 18 weeks, for the second trimester screening.    Good luck|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	ya they do a vaginal sonogram at around 6 weeks or a couple weeks later depending when u start going but they do to measure how the baby's developing, and then they do the ultrasound at around 20 weeks. i am going to a free clinic an that's when they did mine.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	For me it was 7 weeks, 17 weeks, and 20 weeks. I think there's one around 32 weeks or so, but I'm only 25w now.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Sometimes they do that to confirm pregnancy. It depends on the doctor and the clinic.
AA11380378	BEST ADVICE:    DO NOT SIGN THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE    Did I mention, do not sign the birth certtificate. In US law, if you sign the BC your are legally the father even if you are not the biological father, even if later DNA results prove the opposite, he is legally binded by that legal document. I know this sounds bizarre, but it's totally true.     He has the right to request a DNA test at birth. Insurance will not cover this, it will have to be paid out of pocket; unless he wants to sue on family court to determine wheher or not it's his child, in that case, and on most cases, it will be paid by the state. Nowadays they sell DNA kits on drugstores (can you believe it!) that you send in the mail and get the result via phone or mail.      Whatever the course of action, he had the right to refuse signing the birth certificate and request a DNA test. Better safe than sorry.    Good luck|`|AA10626484	you can have a dna test right when the baby is born. i don't think you can have one when the baby is still in the belly. i know for a fact the doctor can take blood from the umbilical cord though. so please tell this to your brother and don't let him forget!!! sounds like she wants him all to herself! that's not cool at all.|`|627pWyVkaa	tell him too take her court now, and they should order a paternity test (more then likely not to be done until the baby is born) because it can cause a miscarriage. And put all money owed on hold until proof comes back either way on the paternity. I would tell him not to pay for anything because she could be lying if she wont pee on a stick or let him go to appt with her, then why should he just pay for something that may not be real. And if shes not lying she should at least verify she is pregnant otherwise He will have to wait until the baby is born.|`|3g1y1Ahhaa	I think that he should break up with her because of the horrible things that she has done to him already. He cant really make her prove that she is pregnant, but if he saw the ultra sound then that should prove it. and yes he can get a paternity test done, but he might have to go to court to get it done. As far as child custody, he would need to prove that she is an unfit mother. My suggestion would be to let her have the baby for a short while to gain proof that she is unfit mother.|`|ba11762437a3276bc8acfec56128a271aa	Okay... there are a lot of questions here. He can't make her prove that she's pregnant. If I were him, I would not support her while she's pregnant, and then after the baby is born (if it ever is) I would get a paternity test.. then, if he's the father, he can take responsibility. He probably will not get full custody of the child unless he can somehow prove her unfit. BUT states these days are more and more giving joint custody because they believe its better for the child to have both parents in their lives. IF he gets joint custody of the baby, I don't think he will have to pay child support because he will have the baby half of the time. I hope things work out for him, but like I said if I were him, I would say hey... show me the positive test, or else let me come to an appointment with you so I know you're pregnant.. and even then, I would demand a paternity test at birth. He should just tell her if she can't prove she's pregnant, he's leaving.|`|nkEEQtmEaa	Let's just face facts here.  Your brother ought not to have had unprotected sex with her if he had not wanted a baby.  Young women are usually pretty fertile, and can easily become pregnant.      Men who don't want their impregnated females to have custody simply because they don't want to pay child support are a big problem in today's society.  No matter how much she may get from him in so-called child support, there's no amount of money that can truly compensate a mother for carrying the baby for nine months, then going through labor and delivery, and THEN having to raise the child alone.      Every child should be a wanted child!    I'm sure he IS freaking out, but it will be a long battle if he wants to have full custody.      In the meantime, your brother needs to have some counseling as to birth control.  If he had taken responsibility in the first place and used a condom, this would not have happened.    I doubt very much he used a condom.  If he had, he wouldn't be so frightened that his sister has to ask questions for him and defend him in a forum like Answers, which cannot change the facts.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	1. No, he can not make her prove the pregnancy.  2. No, in-vitro paternity tests are so dangerous that they would not do it in a case like this.  3. As soon as the child is born (about a week after) he can get a paternity test done, then he can file, but it is unlikely he will get full custody unless he can prove she is unfit to raise a child or she gives up her rights.    That being said, however, he is not obligated to pay for anything while she is still pregnant.|`|AA12062311	Most doctors wont do the first sonogram until at least 8 weeks. But to answer your questions First for all of them it depends on what your brother is willing to do because if he is being wishy washy on it and is not willing to go to court, then there is nothing he can do to make her do anything.  However if he is willing to take her to court here are the answers.  1. Yes he can take her to court and have the court mandate a pregnancy test if she is asking him to pay her medical expenses, which by the way if she is pregnant and she proves paternity in court she can claim (my husband owes back support due to all medical costs his ex incured during her pregnancy. I guess once pregnant a woman is no longer able to support herself and has no responsiblity to in any way).  2. He can try to go to the court and have them require an amnio, but I doubt he will get it. The risk to the mother and the fetus are high, but he can have paternity checked the moment the child is born, and I would highly recommend he have that done.  3. He can file for custody I believe as soon as the child is born. If she is planning to move to FL, he might speak to a lawyer to at least bar her from doing that while pregnant with his child until paternity and custody is settled. If he goes to court he can stop her from moving out of state with his child. It will be hard for him to get full custody unless he can prove her an unfit mother, but most courts tend to side with the mother over the father. He might have a chance for primary custody where the child spends most of the time with him. I think what he would need to prove for that is that he has a better support system to help with the child, has more stable income, and won't need state assistance, especially if she will.     Good luck to your brother. Too many men are getting screwed over in the family court system, I hope this one works out in his favor if she is as bad as you discribe.|`|dPULl5hjaa	so much drama - i quit reading|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Well as for DNA it has to be done AFTER the baby's born.   As for proving pregnancy best way : take her to a doctor for an ultrasound. He should go with her THE WHOLE TIME. HUsbands are allowed to be in there, or even boyfriends, significant others,etc. He should be there when the doctor gives her an ultrasound. And shwoing an ultrasound pic @ 6 weeks it could be anything!! The first few weeks it's really hard to tell if there's a baby or not. BUt now she's 9 weeks? She could have a 10 week ultrasound and if she's really pregnant the baby will be much bigger and be able to really see him and with a doctor there performing the ultrasound there's no lying....|`|AA10186411	First off, if he didn't really like her, then he had NO business sleeping with her, and deserves whatever he gets.  No he cannot make her prove pregnancy.  But he is entitled to a DNA test AFTER the baby is born.  He could only get full custody if he can prove her unfit, which is pretty hard to do.  He made his bed and now he has to lie in it.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Well is she pretending or not? You said she was pretending and then you said she showed the u/s pics to your mom. But to answer your questions..  1. No he can not make her prove anything  2. There is a test called an amniocentesis test where a needle is inserted into the uterus through the abdomen and amniotic fluid is taken out. Amniotic fluid contains fetal cells so they can determine DNA that way. But it does carry a risk of infection and miscarriage.   3. He can file for custody after the baby is born but he WON'T get it. It is VERY difficult to get custody of a child away from the mother, especially a newborn baby. He would have to PROVE extensively that she was unfit. And that is very very hard to do. Until your brother takes her to court he has NO rights to the baby at all. A court of law would have to establish paternity and then it will set support, custody and visitation. Until the child is 2 or 3 he won't even get it overnight. So he should try to get along with her as best he can and you should probably butt out.     If he didn't like her, he shouldn't have slept with her.|`|mxixfE3Raa	Paternity test after the birth.  And he does NOT have to pay ANY money to her and the baby until..  1.He knows she's pregnant.  2.Knows its his.    Therefore until the baby is born, it's in his best interests to refrain from giving them money. He doesn't have to.
d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I haven't heard anyone say this. It sounds like you are very young and uneducated about sex and pregnancy. Whoever is telling you this doesn't know what they are talking about. Most sexually educated people know that you need to ovulate (release an egg) to get pregnant and that usually happens 14 days after the first day of your period. (About a week after a period ends) But anyone that has sex should also know that it is possible to get pregnant at anytime during the cycle, even if it is a small chance. Every month your body produces a Corpus Luteum Cyst on your ovary when you ovulate. This Cyst produces the hormones to maintain a pregnancy should one occur when you ovulate. It gets the lining of your uterus ready for implantation. When no conception occurs, you have a period. This is your body shedding the Corpus Luteum and the lining of your uterus. If conception occurs, the corpus luteum stays and starts receiving HCG hormone and your body will not shed anything. Therefore you will have no period. It would be nice if we ovulated on that magical 14th day of our cycle, but mother nature isn't perfect and we sometimes ovulate late or early.|`|TTogBTYxaa	I Have heard that too so your not alone.. But Its not true.. Just have sex when ever you can and hopefully you'll become pregnant|`|Iqifd3SGaa	I have never heard what you are saying either. Yes it is possible to get pregnant if you have sex on your period but it is rare. You were getting info from the wrong sources. If you are trying, have sex in the middle of your cycle and maybe do some more legit research on how to conceive.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	the reason you have your peorid is because your body is getting rid of all the unused eggs...therefore getting pregnant during your peorid can happen but its incredibly rare.|`|MtC3CWZraa	I've never heard anyone say that.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	are the people saying this your 12 and 13 year old friends?

Your best bet would probably be to try the day after you get off your period, and keep trying every night that week. Your period is the end of the egg which is why the egg is no longer up for fertilization.

If I was her mother, I would run away and hide.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	She already had 6 children.  She's unmarried.  She is obsessed about having children.  She had artificial insemination.  She lives with her parents.  She's in her mid 30's.  What else do you want to know?|`|3dSCbIcEaa	i hear she already had six young kids, went to some type of clinic and had in vitro and voila, 8 babies were born. she was refused state aid bc it was in vitro. so i hear.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	shes a single mum of 6 living with her parents who works at an ivf clinic so a lot of talk about how she used sperm from the clinc she works at   NO wonder she doesnt wanna go public!|`|zwctZ812aa	Yes.  She had IVF for her 6 previous children, and then again for these 8.  Irresponsible!!!|`|7p2IknBOaa	She already had 6 kids, is single and living with her parents.  She's about 33, I think.|`|soet2Snhaa	my mum told me this, umm i think the couple knew they were gonna have 7 babies - up to baby G, but when she was giving birth, there was an 8th one too! so baby H also was born. They used that letter thing lol.|`|DNygQdmVaa	she had 6 kids already and is a single mother.  she lives in cali.      google it|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I think the story is that the women had eight babies (not naturally), when she already had six other children at home. She is not married, nor does she have a boyfriend, and she still lives with her parents. Apparently, according to her mother, she has been obsessed with having children from a young age.|`|ELeOcIsdaa	not be rude but why do you care.  it's not your life and if this Mother with the 8 children wanted you to know more she would go public and tell her story.  until then avoid Gossip|`|4ksa4lhWaa	She's crazy lady LOL, she has 6 kids already all done by invetro. NO BABY DADDIES WITH ANY OF THEM. She was married but now divorced but he did not have any of the kids.  She wanted more kids so she had 8.  She now has 14 kids and just lost her house in Bankruptcy.  Her mom said she is obsest with having kids since high school.  She tried to get pg in high school but she couldn't have kids.      My question is:  who is going to pay for all these kids.  And why did they implant her again.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	someone needs to tell that ***** that they cured Polio. No need to screw up traffic for the rest of us.|`|0VHolTVEaa	Shes a single mother who lives in california with her 6 kids. She had ivf with her boyfriend as she loved children. She knew she was having 7 babies but the 8th popped out while she was having a ceaserean operation.

pXSKSS3daa	LOL, too cute. I can see Reece doing this!    Noah "helps" by making plenty of messes for Mommy to clean up during the day, so I don't get bored. What a sweetie.... lol.    I think a toy dustpan and brush would be great for him! He may not know exactly what to do with it at this age but you can sure teach him.    (Can you believe our boys are ten months old already!?)|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Yeah my son cleans a lot, and I am NOT a tidy person.    Get some murphey's oil soap or castille soap for your floors.  Its non-toxic and very safe.  I've had them get it in their eyes and not complain, its vegetable oil based.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	:)  My 18 mos old will push a vacuum cleaner around ( its a tiny bagless space saver one, but looks like a real size one) I havent turned it on though because I think the noise might freak her out.. And my son wipes the floor with wipes when he spills his juice ( hes three though) and says something like , oh no I made a mess.. :)   My 5 year old actually vacuums and dusts etc and he asks me to.. He likes it :)|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	He "helps" me type sometimes when I have him on my lap and I am trying to type something. He actually banged up the keyboard pretty badly and knocked some keys off...so I don't really let him do it anymore. He also tries to help me feed him his bottle but almost always ends up pinching the nipple and spraying milk all over his face...what a mess that is! Maybe when he gets a little older he will try to help me clean up like your little one. That sounds too cute!|`|kQEnJpOvaa	Cade is doing the same thing now. So so cute. He will see me putting his toys away and will help me and then he will get a towel or napkin and pretend to wipe the coffee table. I would get a broom and dust pan, he will love it!|`|V6r4RPI5aa	i dont see why not, my son helps me with the dusting i pretend to spray polish on a clean duster and give it him, he loves helping mummy you can see it on his face!!|`|nYioXmnGaa	Lol so cute my little son   gets some stuff for me  when it falls but i have to  ask him like a million times because he wants to be  on boys in the family. He is not to fond of my pregnancy !|`|IngripgMaa	Our son has a broom and dust pan.  He also has a rag that he goes around and "Cleans" with.  He must see me doing it?  My husband always trys to get him to pick up the football.....but, he always goes for the dust-pan.  Thasss my boy!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Ohhhh... cute!     That's great that he is mimicking you, he just hit anther milestone.      My son loves the vacuum, I have to hide it from him, I am thinking that I am going to get him a toy vacuum.  The other day I was collecting toys in his toy bin, and he started picking up toys and putting them in there as well, it was adorable.  He just turned one.  As far as cleaning up the floor, he usually just shows me where I missed a spot, he will go up to a spec on the floor and point to it,  lol!  I always say he's my biggest cretic when it comes to house cleaning.
2HETgiwgaa	Your cycle length is the number of days starting with the day you have enough flow to need a pad or tampon, and ending the day before your next period.  Generally about the middle of the cycle is average for your most fertile time - but there are signs you can check to be sure (eg CM cervical mucous, and your temperature first thing in the morning before you get out of bed as soon as you wake up)    Try a charting website to keep track of your cycle and see when you are most likely to get pregnant.  You can take your charts to your doctor if you are concerned you aren't seeing a normal pattern or signs that you are ovulating.  I use fertilityfriend.com which also has lots of info which will help you understand your own fertility.  Good luck and BABY DUST|`|fNs20NZEaa	yes it sound like you need to have a poo|`|9B1FVdnPaa	Ask your doctor, its for the best|`|4on73VKSaa	hi, i had my little boy 7 wks ago and b4 that i was trying 4 2 yrs, you are most fertile half way through your cycle but as you have the implant as soon as you stop contraception you are highl fertile then, i found i fell pregnant as soon as i stopped trying! well hope that might help and gd luck! xxx|`|TcuL9XOWaa	Irregular periods make it very tricky to know when you are most fertile.  It's usually in the middle of your cycle for 3 days.  You start counting your cycle on the first day of your period and it ends the day before your next period starts.  One good way to know when you are most fertile is to check your cervical mucous everyday.  When it is the consistency of an egg white you are more likely to conceive.  I'm not sure if the implant is the same as other birth control but you should wait 3 cycles before trying to conceive.|`|jn3fXcM6aa	Umm... I would say ask your docotor. But hten iagain i m only 13!|`|kcdB6sswaa	Go look on babycenter.com... lots of info about this there.|`|44OH7Si6aa	Here read this, it should give you some tips on what to start doing once the implant is removed  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/how-to-...|`|NPmRmnG6aa	Just have sex all the time. No need to really plan it out. How romantic is it to 'say honey I'm ovulating so lets have sex.|`|dPmK83UYaa	you should try this...most of it's free and even if your cycle is irregular you can track it and get an idea of when you will ovulate and when you are most fertile..|`|28fNd725aa	When you go to have your implants taken out I would check with your dr at that time.. There are alot of ways to know that you are ovulating and so I definitly think that would be your best option.  Especially if you dont cycle regularly... your doctor would have the best options for you!!    Congrats on your TTC status!!|`|627pWyVkaa	well when your on birth control you don't get your period. If you got your actual menstrual period that would mean you have ovulated. You will have to get off your implant and wait until after you have gotten your first actual period (not counting a bleed withdrawl you may get after shortly being off your implant). After that point you may want to  mark down how long your cycles are to guess when you may ovulate. If you really want to get pregnant faster after you get your period, start testing with ovulation kits. and the only way you will conceive is too keep trying!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Usually 14 days after the first day of your period you are most fertile. Get a ovulation kit at the store. They're sold at most drugstores. You can get one for $20. Just follow the directions on the box.|`|e7b80e1d39247de6534e1736b54bed52aa	On a 28day cycle. you should try 2-3days b4 but say your period is on the 17th. give 2-3 days to let the guy recover and let sperm built up. then on the like 14th or 15th. Try then.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I have irregular periods, i would have one 64 days apart from the last on, one 14 days apart and 120 days sometimes longer. I am pregnant. I got the positive test the day before I was to go on an ovulation medication called clomid.  It will happen for you.  I was on Depo for only one shot (3 months of BC) and It took me one year to get my period, I dont know about the implant that you have or how long it will be for you I just know that you shouldn't give up and that you shouldn't lose hope. Don't stres and just let it go. It will happen!!!|`|jqYpMCXmaa	i dont really know much about what your asking, what i do no is when a woman is most fertile. during the month between one period to another, the beginning of the third week before your period is due is when your most fertile, this is the time when your ovulating is at its peak.
AA12057835	Give her the bottle first.  You can give her the 6oz, or 5...whichever you prefer.  Fir the first feeding you can use 1-2 Tbsp of cereal mixed with milk or water, but make it runny so she can get used to eating from a spoon.  Do this everyday, but you can gradually make the cereal thicker as she gets used to it.  After a couple of weeks you can start to introduce veggies and fruit....1/4 jar at a time to start with cereal.    I am a first time mom too and I could have pulled my hair out trying to figure all of this stuff out.  But after a couple of trys, you get the hang of it!|`|nKXTjqQWaa	When I feed my son solids I do it between feedings. For example, if he breastfeeds at 9 am then at 10 am I will feed him his solids and he may take a few drinks to wash it all down. Then he will breastfeed again at 11 am. (He BF every 2 hours) When I started him on cereal I started with one ounce breast milk and mixed cereal in until it was still runny but not liquefied.|`|t9S0dqfLaa	I felt the same way, reading and reading and reading everything on the subject, and really it just works itself out.  We give our son ( 8 months ) rice cereal first thing in the morning, I mix 2oz of formula with rice cereal, in the beginning I made it pretty soupy now it's thicker and I mix some fruit in there then I top him off with a 4 oz bottle, sometimes he wants it sometimes he doesn't.  What I've noticed with my son is that sometimes he's really hungry and then some days he hardly eats at all. His doc is not concerned|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	With mine i mixed some of her breastmilk in the rice cereal and then gave her breastmilk afterwards she didn't eat much rice cereal though at first so just give her some time|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I was there only 2 months ago. This is a really confusing thing and everyone has a different opinon. Since she will only be taking a little bit right now, probably a teaspoon or so really runny with the breastmilk, I would say give her a full milk feed before. Once she starts taking a little more, you could cut back by an ounce or so. Since I was worried about my little guy getting enough, I settled on giving him about 3/4 of a milk feed, then the food, then offering the bottle again.     You will just have to find a schedule that works for you, and this will change as you add more meals. The main thing is to keep her on a good amount of breastmilk/formula (your pediatrician will give you a minimum amount) and work your way slowly to 3 meals a day. my son is 8 months old and we just started adding his 3rd meal. Our schedule with milk feedings has changed so we are working on finding what works best (He like solids way more than breast milk so I have to work to get him to take enough). Good luck and don't hesitate to talk to your pediatrician about any questions you have.|`|2f7d753df622c9c42a37e136f0451cb6aa	lol. its all trial and error.  With my son i gave him rice ceral out of a ceral bottle. its a 4oz bottle that has a bigger nipple so that the ceral can go thru it.  After that 4oz  bottle i gave him another 4 of milk and put him to bed.  When using a spoon.  your daughter will let you know when she is full.  I started giving it to my son at night.  I always gave ceral and then about 2-3 hours later gave him a bottle to put him to sleep.  But I started my son on the rice ceral bottle at 8 weeks.  He was on Step 1 jar food by 6 months. Its what ever you feel comfortable with.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	It really doesn't matter. I've read offer solids first so baby is hungry, offer them afterwards so baby is NOT hungry, offer them in the middle so baby is hungry but not ravenous...    I wouldn't even mix an ounce of cereal first time - she's likely to only eat half a teaspoonful. I'd do a spoonful of milk and a little sprinkle of rice. If she loves it, you can always mix up a bit more.    And don't be surprised if she doesn't like it - taste it yourself. It's like wallpaper paste :) My daughter loathed the stuff, but adored mashed banana.|`|JP2h62qiaa	What you should do is give her the bottle when she wakes up in the morning and then after about an hour when she is playing( beforeshe is hungry for her next bottle) introduce the cereal. She may not like it. You do want to give her the bottle first though so she wont freak out about wanting a bottle when eating.  You can mix it with your breast milk. my son liked it thick.   Good luck.    I started off making 6 ounces and tehn using two for the cereal..Now I remember. Then Iwould give him the bottle a little bit and then sppon feed him and then give him the bottle again.  You will have to find something that works for her. She may take to it wonderfully of she may go bezerk!
kaqPSgTVaa	Yeah that sounds like a miscarriage. Did you tell your doctor that you had positives at home because that meant you were pregnant? I think you should go back to the doctor and get an exam for a miscarriage just to make sure everything was ejected and you are ok. You did miscarry.|`|7bTOY5vHaa	Change your doctor. I still believe its a misscarriage.|`|jNYEi0CTaa	Wow thats weird that she didnt tell you what it was.  Im thinking it was a mc...|`|BkOgWbg6aa	This is extremly odd the likes of which i have never even heard of... First off let me say please get yourself a new doctor she obviously doesnt care about her patients at all which could be dangerous to your health!! second off i would go get a new doctor and another opinion and let the doctor run the pregnacy test on you|`|weBWzGxKaa	yes it was!|`|0jo0cfkWaa	Then dats actually weard! to be honest i would make an investigation and you could conplain to the hospital and if the police needs to be involve its even better.|`|ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	Miscarriages are generally in the form of heavy, crampy bleeding for 1-3 weeks.  Also, I had a friend who had an abortion via pill, and when the "mass" came out (after hours of painful cramps and contractions, btw, not just "going pee"), it was mostly blood and red tissue, not shiny white.  Shiny white is not an embryo.  It was probably a mass of pus or discharge, possibly yeast, that was causing the odor.  If the doctor wasn't concerned, you shouldn't be either.
627pWyVkaa	No. You can try lotions like palmers coco butter for stretch marks, Or anything with vitamin e and coco butter, you cant ever get rid of stretch marks unless you physically remove that skin that has it, or have surgery (so the skin isnt being stretched) more then likely its because her breasts are large) or weigh enough that the skin is being pulled, Also try a more supportive bra> i have them on my breasts, but there fairly large as well DD's Trust me nothing will work unless you get a breast reduction, or augmentation, The lotions MAY decrease the visibility a little but, But im being honest it wont go away. sorry.|`|AA10186411	No, you cannot.  They will fade, but you cannot get rid of them unless you have plastic surgery.  Tell her to just accept them and move on.|`|3SIRKIBaaa	There isn't really a product that can get rid of stretch marks. Some of them can however lighten them up and fade a little but not completely take them away. Remember these are tears in your skin. What she can do is go to a dermatologist. They have a skin resurfacing procedure that they can do and that can remove the stretch marks from your skin. It can be a little expensive though.|`|P1E5AqQnaa	no.  it's sucks butt too!  Palmers 'stretch-mark' cream smooths things out a bit, but they're still there.  But don't spend money on the serums and stuff- it's all worthless...|`|9PmOWtLOaa	you can't get rid of them but there is a new product out called bio-oil and it works wonders it fades them so they are practically invisible. GOOD LUCK!!

And plain rice crispies with fresh strawberries or banana on top. So I am probably going to have a south beach meal although I kinda dont want that either.  I love the guy that said if you were his girlfriend he would not let you eat that.  What a great guy, knocks his girl up and doesnt marry her, but hey at least he cooks for her.|`|10mOwk0Taa	Haha, I'm having a hard time eating meat, but for some reason Taco Bell really hits the spot when I'm feeling nauseous.

By the time I was 30 weeks my husband just couldn't stand it anymore, he would eat PB&J sandwiches instead, LOL! With this pregnancy I do not have that urge. Weird!    I had a romaine lettuce salad with boiled egg, colby cheese cubes, ham cubes and shredded carrots, smothered in creamy french dressing. It was tasty!|`|PwhrTNZraa	Before I came down with this NASTY cold 2 weeks ago, I was having really bad McDonald's cravings.....now all I want is my sense of smell and taste back so I can enjoy food again!!!

NWa45ZDIaa	Because they're idiots!|`|67QVKHQ3aa	carelesness, unprotected sex, and girls that wanna be all grown up like us responsible women...its also a good way to get attention...|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Bad parents result in bad kids. More bad parents = more bad kids = harder to be a good parent because of all the bad influences.|`|DNygQdmVaa	they have unprotected sex.|`|IFqY2w1Paa	I agree with the first answer! =)  That's how I became pregnant with my son at 18.|`|bnQ7im8Caa	unprotected sex. and the influence they receive from other girls their age with babies.|`|AA10196172	First, is social breakdown. It used to be that kids were terrified about what their parents would do, or social disapproval. They wwould worry about getting kicked out of the house, and 50 years ago you couldn't go to high school while pregnant, even if you were married.     Part of the socila breakdown, too, may be that kids don't feel part of the family any more. They think with their own baby, they will get "love" and togetherness that many families don't provide enough of.    Bad things happened if they got pregnant, There were homes for unwed mothers, until they gave birth - or they were sent away. Welfare was not very supportive, most mothers were pressured into giving up their child for adoption, which was very painful too.    Religion used to be a bigger deal, so a lot more kids years ago were indoctrinated on how they would go to hell if they even thought about sex. Today, sex is everywher in our media.    Also, if you haven't got your sights set on being the doctor or lawyer or engineer, what's the reason to wait? Notice the ones who actually apply themselves and go through university, usually are not the ones side-tracked by having babies.    Today, it's almost like there's no consequences. Most teen mothers keep their kid, their parents babysit while the girl still goes to parties and clubbing. Kids go to school pregnant - a coworker once asked if I thought she was being mean by telling her daughter she could NOT go to a baby shower for her classmate - in Grade 8!!! She asked, "why should anyone be celebrating that?"    Evolution-wise, well - kids were getting married and starting familes as soon as they could hundreds of years ago. Of course, with poor nutrition, puberty was 14 or 15 not 11 or 12. But a girl was married and a mother at 15, with her hubby working the farm. We make girls (and boys) go to school until 18, sometimes up to 22 years old. So when they would be out farming or hunting centuries ago at that age, today they still have to act like kids, live at home, go to school. But deep down in their subconscious, they want to be reproducing.    Also, in the days before medicine, babies died at an alarming rate. no wonder we're conditioned to keep making more. For example, Henry VII had 6 wives. He had 3 children that made it past the first few months - Edward IV, "Bloody" Mary I, and Elizabeth I. His first divorce happened after the princess of Spain had only the one child (Mary) and over 10 miscarriages or still-births, or babies that died right away. Most of his other wives did no better.    So - we're programmed to start reproducing as soon as we can; but society says "wait", sometimes without giving us good alternatives or good reasons.|`|JMDQr0tqaa	Peer pressure, the stars having babies and having unprotected sex. I wonder sometimes if teens will ever listen.|`|s56Hv7BSaa	the same reason why they all start their period early. all the hormones in the meat. and curiosity and stupidity|`|HQXBP8Evaa	This is because their is too much pear pressure for these yong kids these days.|`|eya1WDS4aa	I was 17 when i got pregnant 18 when i had my son and we wore condoms and i was on birth control. And honestly i wouldnt have changed a thing because my son has been the best thing that has ever happend to me. And without my son or my husband i would probably we alot worse off.      Some get pregnant threw unprotected sex and some get pregnant while on protecting. bottom line if cant take care of a baby and handle the results of having sex you shouldnt be having sex.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Why is it matter how young you are (not saying like 13 or anything) but 18 and 19 year olds have been getting married and having kids for a long time, it is fine by me, it is the choice I made for my life, and I want a family and not too concerned about a professional career. I think that even though it is wonderful that more and more young women want to be professionals and not have a family, I don't see anything wrong with going the family route either. And, I can still juggle community college and a part time job, and taking care of my wonderful hubby! And I don't care how many thumbs down I get for doing so!  Now as far as like young teenagers like in high school, no I don't think it is a very good decision.|`|w0yDXiH9aa	Alot to do with society, we glorigy sexiness. It's everywhere, music, movies, magazines. The other is the lack of parenting, parents aren't involved in the lives of their children. The lack of education, most teeanger that are having sex are not being educated properly with what can happend and how to protect themselves and where to get it.  In today's society most teens are getting their information from other teens that are not fully educated on safe sex.  It's a sad epidemic, it's a hard cycle because a lot of the teen parents have parents that had them at/or around the same age.
VKgD1K3baa	It is actually not common for women to not produce enough milk, many women think that because their babies nurse frequently and many do not go 3-4 hours between feeds; it is more like 1-2. Colostrum is all your baby needs, the more times you put your baby to the breast, the quicker your milk will come in, mine came in on day 2! Whatever you do, try as hard as you can not to supplement, this will cause you delay in milk production.    Most hospitals have lactation consultants free of charge. They are wonderful! They can help you with the latch and answer any questions you have.    Best of luck to you!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	He/she will get enough.  One of the worst things you can do to fail at breastfeeding is to supplement w/ formula.  (There are some situations where this is needed but very rare.)  It is a supply and demand process.  Don't pump prior to your milk supply being established if you don't have to.  Also, try to avoid nipple confusion.  Educate yourself and work w/ a lactation consultant; you will do fine.  Good luck!!    (It's not a dumb question at all!!)|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	Good for you trying it the second time around! I went through the SAME thing as you. I had a tough time breastfeeding my daughter and gave up about two months in, but mostly I was feeding her formula. This is what I did with my son who is two months and is breastfeeding like a champ!    As SOON as he came out he breastfed. Try not to let them take the baby from you if he's healthy. It would help if its in your birth plan.   After that, do not let those nurses tell you that you need to give formula because you do not. My son had the colostrum and he was fine. No formula. This one nurse was giving me such a hassle I asked them not to send her back to my room. Needless to say, my milk came in while I was in the hospital (the pre-milk anyway) and all of his meconium was gone before we went home.     The best advice I could give is, do not panic. Do your research now. You may or may not find support, so educate yourself. I used youtube to see what a proper latch was and how to do it. The first two weeks were a little rough but it worked out. He's getting plenty of milk and I have more than enough.     So, don't supplement with formula and don't let the nurses intimidate you. Stick to your guns!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	The baby will get everything he or she needs from colostrum. The best thing you can do is nurse, nurse, nurse! The more your baby is at your breast, the faster your milk will come in. Don't be alarmed if your baby is nursing frequently - it's normal and it in no way means you aren't making enough to satisfy your child. One of the worst things you can do for your supply is to offer a bottle instead of offering the breast...just hang in there and know that after the first few weeks breastfeeding will get much easier!!|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	Actually colostrum is very good for your baby, they advise you to start feeding your baby right away in the hospital...it also has ALOT of nutrition. breastfeeding a great and its easy..it might be a little painful for the first week but dont give up, it WILL get better, i dont even feel a thing when my daughter is nursing...as long as your baby is latched properly, you will not get cracked nipples or sore ones...also to get your milk supply up, after each feeding, try pumping, good luck and you can do it! :]|`|eu6UQElYaa	The fact is, the vast majority of breastfed babies get plenty of nutrition. New moms just tend to worry because they can't see how much milk the baby is taking in.   As long as the baby is gaining weight then you know it's getting enough.   If not then a lactation consultant will guide you on your options but I wouldn't even worry about it unless the baby isn't gaining.       Yes they can live off of colustrum.  Colustrum is very nutrient rich and all the baby really needs in the first few days of life.    Congratulations on giving it a shot.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Have confidence in yourself and your body.  Do not supplement.  If a doctor advises you to supplement, demand a second opinion.  Be the fierce momma-tiger that some of us were not!|`|AA11476782	They get all the nutrition they need from the colostrum until your milk comes in.  That is how all breastfed babies do it.  In the hospital, you and the doctors will keep a chart of how often your baby has wet/dirty diapers.  They will tell you if s/he is not "voiding" enough and what to do if that is the case.|`|PYSMK0JBaa	This was the ONLY way to feed a baby for thousands of years. Your baby will not starve before your milk comes in. The more you nurse in those first few days, the quicker your milk will come in...so if you give formula, you can delay your milk coming in.     The way you know if your baby is getting enough is if 1. he/she is gaining weight 2.having lots of dirty/wet diapers    Breastfeeding is time consuming and some people think it is more work..but I found it to be one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and I'm very proud that I stuck through the rough spots. You can do it!|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	This sounds like something you really want to commit to this time, so why don't you consider purchasing a book on the topic and getting in touch with a lactation specialist, should you need one. Breastfeeding while totally natural and rewarding can be complex in the beginning, as you know. I used my books daily to help support me in what I was doing, and have had successful times breastfeeding
c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	My doc estimated my daughter to be at the higher end of 6lbs - the lower end of 7lbs.  She came out at 7lb 10oz in which we were all surprised!  I had a very tiny belly so I never thought she'd weigh that much lol....|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	The further along you are the more difficult it is to estimate an accurate weight for a baby. And while its more common to over estimate, it is easy to both under and over estimate the weight of the child. The day before I had my son an ultrasound estimated about his weight to be only 4.5lbs and he came into the world 36 hours later weighing a healthy 6lbs, 7oz.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	With me they were "sure" she would be 7.8 pounds...she came out 6.10...I TOLD them she'd be in the sixes, but they were like no, she's not that small...Mommy's normally know better than docs and ultrasounds...I wouldn't listen to them. They can be off either way.|`|ostF23Omaa	I went to the doc on a wed and they told me my son was 6.5 lbs I had him by c section that sun and he was almost 9 lbs. sometimes I don't think they know what there doing.|`|heDtLdz5aa	a week and a half before i had my son i had anultra-sound to estimate the weight..which was predicted to be 8 ibs 5 oz....my baby was born at 9 ibs 1 oz...i guess they were quite accurate with mine...but they are not always right...
YFPMcHCbaa	None of the people on here will be able to tell you if you're pregnant. All the symptoms you get during pregnancy can also be associated with something else.    Go to the doctor, take a test, or do some research. There are so many different places to get great information on the web.    babycenter.com  pregnancy.org  pregnancy.com  americanpregnancy.org  webmd.com/baby  pregnancy360.com  fitpregnancy.com  surebaby.com  pregnancytoday.com  pregnancy-calendars.org|`|i3pn4jNcaa	if your embaressed then g to planned parenthood and take a test there. its free|`|RzYePezkaa	No it is not normal for your period to be late you should buy a test to know for sure if test turns up negative then see your doctor something else could be going on.|`|2l7lbcJWaa	You have to take a test. You will know better than anyone on here whether or not you are pregnant. You know your body and if it's not normal for you to be late then something is up. The only way to know for sure is take a test. I think its embarrassing too, so anytime I've taken a test I had my sister go in and buy it for me. Its also less embarrassing if you go to a pharmacy and pay for the test at the pharmacy counter instead of the regular checkout line. They don't look at you funny or anything. But you could just send a friend or family member in! Or your boyfriend, if you can get him to lol.  Good luck!!|`|bwOPe5Jyaa	The only way you'll find out is a test.  You are 19 and extremely fertile.  I always had my boyfriend pull out but I got pregnant at 19.  You also had intercourse during your most fertile time of your cycle.  Go on the pill girl..you have your whole life ahead of you!  You are not mature enough to have a baby, it really changes your life.|`|LTMgLRWYaa	From personal experience my period was always late or screwed up after I had sex recently.     I would still of course by a test and the only way you can be completely positive is by seeing your most unloved OBGYN.
WbJPQM1naa	Jog around the block?   Just kidding!  Take a nice long walk and if weather is bad, go to the mall!      Have sex...there are hormones in sperm which can maybe help induce your labor.      Keep drinking lots of water and taking small, protein rich snacks every few hours to keep up your metabolism and blood sugar.  And try to rest a bit, though.  Because you'll be using all your strength soon!    You can have your baby naturally and enjoy it!  I sure did!  People think I'm crazy when I tell them that I LOVED giving birth!   I just did.  It was the most awesome, incredible moments of my life!      Soon you'll be having yours!  Good luck and take good care.  R|`|yB5go5wbaa	Have them sweep your membranes at your next appointment.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	You can go walking|`|m5WRne9Eaa	drink poop|`|3EhoJ42zaa	I am also 38 weeks.  I learned today that I am 4cm 80% and my doctor stripped my membranes.  She told me the more natural ways to help things along is to walk awlk walk walk walk walk and walk some more.

I think it was a coincidence! She also had sex. I would just do some hours of walking and anything else that won't give you diarrhea like castor oil will.|`|lqSMkDNkaa	Defenitely sex will do it, deep too.  Thats how it worked for me.|`|SPVt85Hyaa	Don't give into pressure to make this baby be born on anyone's time schedule except his/her own.  The statistics show that induction leads to problems for you and baby - baby's lungs might not be ready to breathe and thus he'll be in NICU - and you will become one of the 1 in 3 women that receive c sections.  Babies know when they're ready to come out; let nature do it's thing.    If you are in active labor and it slows down, one natural treatment to get things progressing is castor oil.  And movement - definitely helps too. There are herbs and homeopathic remedies as well.
bLuqWYSXaa	I would have take it away at least four months ago|`|h59Bc4wfaa	My son is also 14 months old....he still takes his pacy, but as he has only ever taken it at bed time, it's not a big deal.    Now that he's a little older, he only sucks on it for about 10 minutes, then takes it out to fall a sleep.    It's a comfort thing, and it's up to you when you take it from him.|`|DNygQdmVaa	my sonis 14 months too, hes been off the pacifer for months now.  if you think hes ready then go for it.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	It's up to yourself.  I plan on taking the dummy (pacifier) away during the day at a year old, and taking it away completely (i.e. naps and bedtime) at two years old at the latest - if he hasn't already given it up on his own.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	yes. It's advised that they they stop once they reach 12 months.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I am just going to go based off how my son is acting. He is 4 months now.. I can say it wont go past 2 years with the paci.    But I dont see any harm in 14 month old having a paci unless he seems ready to give it up|`|eya1WDS4aa	Yeap. i would have started when he turned a year.|`|Q2w7q73daa	yes!|`|YpgoGNuXaa	Yes.
q4WtQvSZaa	You could track your temperature and watch for a slight increase around the time of ovulation.  You need to take it at the same time every day but it should give you reliable results.    Another way is to watch the quality of your cervical mucus, when you're ovulating it gets much thinner and watery (to allow the sperm to move through it more easily) and once you know what you're looking for this is a big give away.    Good luck.|`|LiPoEBenaa	My best answer would be to get one of those at home ovulation tests. Since you're irregular, I wouldn't count on the ovulation calendars that they have online. If that doesn't work I would consult with another doctor to see if there is an underlying problem that is causing you to be so irregular :)|`|0oOquvruaa	idk
52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Often times hemorrhaging isn't genetic. It comes from a tear in the placenta or uterus. If you are concerned, talk to a doctor. In this day and age, it is rare to die giving birth. Don't be afraid.|`|uAEZeyAAaa	there should be no problems if present in the hospital at the right time.now with advanced medical knowledge and technology there is nothing to worry about.completely safe|`|gx4s68s8aa	Might depend on the reason for her bleeding.  But regardless, medicine is always advancing so I am sure they have better ways to stop excessive bleeding then when you were born.    For example I have a condition that makes miscarriages and stillbirth more likely (as well as other problems).  Ten years ago I would have a much harder time with pregnancy.  But now they have more advanced medicine and screening techniques that greatly reduce my risk.|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	OMG I HOPE NOT!!!!!!

AaXl3vcCaa	the one where i live have walk in hours on monday wednesday friday from 12-5  and they take appointments in the other time so just call and ask when the walk in times are, they have never asked me where i work or anything, and planned parenthood is not free, the health services place its free and they ask for a donation, you just say hi i would like to get some birth control|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Some clinics accept walk-ins, others require you to schedule before coming in. If you are unsure on your clinics policies, then just schedule ahead of time.|`|c4cafeb95e50c5fbcb03f6ef804f7e3caa	You need to speak to someone first.They will want to know where you live, work, ect.

lx5DnQLKaa	I think celebrity culture is a large influence.  Many celebrities and their babies are plastered over the front of popular teen magazines, and many teenagers are jealous as they think the babies are ''well cute'' in their mini-Chanel and mini-Dolce and Gabbana outfits.    I have, coincidentally, just finished watching a show about school age (under 16s) teens having children, and i was rather surprised by what was shown. Instead of showing the negative sides, such as painful childbirth, falling behind at school, financial issues etc, it focused more on the positives. These girls attended a small ''school'' when they had a laugh and did cheerleading and when one of the girls went into labour, there was barely any footage or information on childbirth. It was simply her all happy to be having a child and then 10 seconds of childbirrthl, followed by footage of everybody cooing over the baby.       Also, families are quite large nowadays, with many teenagers having baby cousins and neices/nephews. After spending a couple of hours with toddlers and babies. a lot of people believe they are ''well cute'' and decide that looking after children is an easy and fun profession, with no hard work at all, and no qualifications or hard work needed, just ''i babysitted my cousin well loads of times''.      Many soaps also glamourise teenage pregnancy, choosing the coolest characters in soaps such as eastenders and hollyoaks to fall pregnant, thus leading to the hundreds of copycat fans cooing over the baby and wanting one of their own.      This leads to my other point - it's cool. This is not my personal opinion, but seems to be a new, unwritten statement. Having a baby is now seen as ''cool'' in society as you get time off school, make other too-broody-too-soon teens jealous, and have a lot of attention. Oh yes, and the common reason - Getting a free house, benefits etc.     The lack of decent sexual education in schools is also to blame. People simply insinuate that teenagers know everything nowadays, but thats simply not true. Yes, they may now about the ''dirty'' stuff, but they have no idea about the statistics, the health issues etc. PSE lessons nowadays are mainly seen as a farce subject. Leaflets are chucked at teenagers, and the information is inside there, yes, but what percentage of teenagers will actually sit down and read it?     Now please understand these are not my personal opinion. I am not wishing to cause insult to anybody here, i am simply stating what I have seen and learnt. If i am incorrect in any of my words, please feel free to let me know.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	The problem isn't the media, it's the parents and the lack of sex ed in school. If sex education was made public and available, teenagers wouldn't make such stupid decisions.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Its not an epidemic its just more looked down on now days. Teens have been getting pregnant since the beging of time. i was 17 when i got pregnant 18 when i had my son and im a great mother im married to his father and we are exspecting another baby in june. Im 20 now.|`|NI3TtvPYaa	I would not call it an epidemic.  The amount of teen pregnancies has actually decreased over the past decades.   However, teen pregnancies are undoubtedly the result of a dearth of sexual education programs in our schools and communities.  Which of course results from a lack of social program funding in general.        ?Each year, almost 750,000 women aged 15-19 become pregnant. Overall, 75 pregnancies occur every year per 1,000 women aged 15-19; this rate has declined 36% since its peak in 1990.[25]    ?The majority of the decline in teen pregnancy rates is due to more consistent contraceptive use; the rest is due to higher proportions of teens choosing to delay sexual activity.[26]    *Response to additional details-  Moral decay is not even close to the right description for those statistics you posted.  A higher percentage of unwed mothers in 2008 as compared to 1950 has nothing to do with teen pregnancies, because being a teenager has no correlation with marriage.      I would definitely attribute the rise in unwed mothers to drastic changes in gender roles since the 1950's.  Obviously it is much more acceptable for a woman to succeed in the workplace now as opposed to then.  The resulting issue is that now women do not need to depend so much on a male for income.  Therefore, you have more women who are not pressured into a marriage that they do not feel is totally right.  Although there was a higher percentage of wedded couples in the 1950's, I seriously doubt that there was a higher percentage of "happy" marriages.      Of course, I do not purport that the statistics can be explained simply in terms changing gender roles.  This is a complex question with many different causes.  I would suggest picking up an anthropological or sociological study on the issue as I do not believe anyone can wholly answer your question given space and time constraints.
P37lIBr2aa	there is an excellent gaiam prenatal/postnatal yoga video at target. my bff who is an exercise science major bought it for me for my birthday and it's amazing! it's not too difficult and really helps with stretching and breathing plus it has different ladies at all stages of pregnancy so you know who to watch and it's revised for how far along you are. I've been doing it lately and it's made a HUGE difference. hope this helps! congratulations!|`|4Uj2SJP1aa	Eat healthy and drink lots of water.  That was my problem when i was pregnant i did not drink enough water and got very sick.   Also go see a doctor you might need to take vitamins too they will tell you exactly what.  Don't pick up anything that is too heavy.|`|2FUjIpZKaa	Prenatal Yoga.  Awesome!  It helps with circulation, relaxation, and strength.

AA11927140	I think you are maybe highly emotional, and that's a good thing!  Hormones!  :)  I have miscarried three times; unless you bled, you did not miscarry.  I'm sure the vomiting will come back- and then you'll wish it would go away again.  If it doesn't, as the other poster mentioned, every pregnancy is different.  I never vomited with mine!  (Sometimes I wanted to, but never did.)  Try and relax.  If you're really worried, take another pregnancy test!  But as I mentioned, you would have known if you miscarried.  It would have been like a "bad" period.  Best wishes!|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I would say that everything is just fine. Each time around will be different and just because you are not losing your food every were doesn't mean you lost your baby. I do believe that you would have had bleeding and pain if you would have miscarried. Best wishes to you and your family|`|627pWyVkaa	You DO NOT STOP ANTI depressants COLD turkey EVER! and IF you were already ON THEM before you became pregnant you CONTINUE TO stay on them!!!!!!!! You will cause your body to go into withdrawl. IT IS SAFE To be on antidepressants while pregnant. And as i said if you were already on them pre-pregnancy you continue on them! IF you need an antidepressant and you are pregnant and were not on them beforehand then they will not start you on them until you are over 12 weeks pregnant.    PLease go back on your medication, as this will cause some of your symptoms. There are only SOME antidepressants NOT safe to be on, However your doctor will know which ones these are, And if they said TO STOP cold turkey get another doctor because that is very dangerous advise and NOT accurate. I am currently on antidepressants and have a very smart and up-to date doctor! A lot of people are ignorant to the fact that new studies are done, and doctors know what is best. PLEASE GO now and ask if yours is on the safe list if not you will need to be put on another one!          Second, You are having morning sickness which does not mean you are having a miscarriage Most likley what you are experiencing is wihtdrawl from your Anti depressant get back on it!!!!!!!!!|`|X0xHXDcTaa	It doesn't sound like you miscarried. Just sounds like jump in your hormone level made you sick for a few days and now your body has adjusted. Don't get to used to it! You may start getting sick again. Every pregnancy is different, with my first i was sick for the first month and then not anymore. The second I wasn't sick at all. My last 2 pregnancies and my previous I have random naseau. If you are really worried you can always go to the ER and tell them something doesn't feel right and ask for an u/s. No guarantees they will give you one, but hey it's worth a shot!|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I understand your concern and your fears are warranted. If you have miscarried and that is the cause of your lack of pregnancy symptoms then you will not have enough progesterone to have a positive pregnancy test. If you want to know just take another test. if the positive result comes up right away you know your hormone levels are fine and you're just getting lucky on the symptoms. If the test is negative or you start bleeding then you should make an appointment with your doctor who can schedule an ultrasound to see if baby is ok.|`|UaL28atDaa	First thing....take a deep breath...Stop stressing yourself out until you know there is something to worry about. It's not good for either of you. Its still early days so its going to be very up and down. This video will explain a lot about what you should be feeling I think you will find it useful. I know it must be hard when you feel like you are going crazy but try to just take a step back and calm down, don't forget being off the anti-anxiety stuff cold turkey is having an affect too.     http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...|`|AR683Nz6aa	a positive is a positive! and next the fact that your two pregnanys are different it does happen and is very very common... could be the oppisite sex to your other child! dont stress because this could cause problems.. i thought i had lost my baby and which made it worse for me when i had to go tho some tests to comfirm i was fine. i kno its easier to say then do.. just try and relax for your babies sake. good luck xx|`|b8f5bc89c528383d165158426b57b42faa	Each pregnancy is different. Don't panic, I think you would know if you had miscarriage(cramping, bleeding). Your hormones is probably running wild, that's why you want to cry and having all the anxiety.  Good Luck|`|1qnbvUYPaa	Theres nothing wrong with you or the baby. Many women don't get morning sickness (myself included). Women get it because it's their body reacting to the hormones your producing rapidly. Just relax, stress isnt good for the baby. Start taking prenatal vitamins and make an apt. for when your 8-10 weeks along. Congrats on your pregnancy and good luck!|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Hey. I know that your worried. Im pregnant too and I worry all the time also. but I think your probably ok. Every pregnancy is different. Just cuz you were sick alot with your last baby, doesn't mean this one will be exactly the same. It is common for sickness to come and go. its just the hormones changing and everything. I wouldn't worry, as long as you havn't seen any blood your probably fine. missed miscarriages do happen sometimes, but it is more common to see blood and cramp alot during a  miscarriage. Its also quite normal for some women early on not to have alot of pregnancy symptoms. Everyone's different. Talk to your doctor soon but I think you'll be fine good luck.

But you could also put the mothers, fathers, and babies name if they've already chosen one, and are certain of the sex.|`|MqFeJiukaa	Just get the invitations.  You can make your own if you like.  Most of the time people expect baby showers to be for the baby.
NbJbZXtGaa	It is normal for BF babies to go several days without pooping at that age. It is only considered constipation of the poop is hard when it comes out. Is it hard or just infrequent? If it is just in frequent, there is no need to worry. If it is hard, consult your pediatrician.|`|hGqQIusSaa	It's probably not constipation, breastfed babies rarely become constipated.    Is she uncomfortable and fussy or showing signs that her tummy hurts? Or is she just not having a movement? If she does go, is it still seedy and grainy?  Like the others said, bf babies can go up to a week with no movements.  It's so easily absorbed that there is little to no waste to remove from their bodies!|`|zZH8Uizwaa	breast milk is the ideal food for your baby and leaves virtually no residue.  pediatricians usually say that a bf baby can go 5-7 days without pooping and that it's okay. salads may make your baby pretty gassy though. no way to get around it. sorry.|`|YKvT9Jhtaa	Breastfed babies do that.  My baby is 5 months and sometimes goes a day without pooping.  And then sometimes she poops several times a day.  It is not constipation unless she is uncomfortable and the poop is hard.  As long as she isn't uncomfortable then she is fine.  Some babies go over a week without pooping and that is normal.

PkWX9Ouwaa	The qualifying child exception for new babies states that they qualify if they were born during the previous year (2008) and have lived with you the entire time. So as long as your child lives with you you can claim it on your taxes.    http://lifeofanewdad.blogspot.com|`|aJLx0nhNaa	You can claim the whole year.  That's why some people call December babies "tax refund babies."  ;)|`|EHY3FnAmaa	You can claim him!    AS long as he was born before the end of the year.

You can claim him.  Your baby could be born 2 seconds before the stroke of midnight on December 31st and you could still claim him. As long as he was born in 2008, you can claim him for the whole year.  You wouldn't believe how many women talk their doctors into inductions or c-sections right at the end of the year to make sure their baby is born before the New Year for that reason. I had my son on Dec. 29th one year and the labor and delivery department was so full. Everyone wanted their little tax deduction before the year ended.|`|XeVecc65aa	As long as he was born in 2008 you can claim him.|`|4ztXoIDKaa	You can claim him when you do taxes this year.

AA12174925	hay un error en tupregunta pues no existe hedroencefalia sino "hidrocefalia"  Aca te dejo la definicion y fijate si coincide con los sintomas de tu nieta.    Definicin         La hidrocefalia es un cuadro clnico que involucra a un grupo de trastornos que producen una alteracin a nivel de la circulacin y reabsorcin normal de lquido cefaloraqudeo del sistema nervioso central.     El lquido cefaloraqudeo es producido a nivel del sistema nervioso a razn de 20 mililitros por hora en los ni?os. Circula por los denominados ventrculos laterales, tercero y cuarto ventrculos, luego por encima del cerebelo y los hemisferios cerebrales, para finalmente ser reabsorbido pasando a la circulacin venosa del sistema nervioso. En la hidrocefalia hay un trastorno que lleva a la acumulacin de este lquido con la consiguiente dilatacin de dichos ventrculos y compresin de las estructuras nerviosas.     Alrededor del 45% de los ni?os con hidrocefalia presenta algn tipo de malformacin cerebral asociada.     En la mitad de los casos, se observa un hemorragia secundaria a un traumatismo o un meningitis, como causa responsable de la hidrocefalia.    Se deben hacer la consulta a diferentes medicos especialistas (ellos son los unicos que pueden dar una solucion si se puede o no curar)  Se deben realizar vairos estudios donde se deben especificar en que grado esta el hidrocefalia y si esta se puede curar.|`|0f07c1ec0d4da4bbf610f0f7536f28e3aa	?No ser hidrocefalia? se controla.

7rCeCVl2aa	Oh God I bet your parents would freak out if they knew what you just did!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...    This is NOT safe hun. You can not post on the internet like this. Do you have any idea what kind of freaks there is online???|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Why not try offering to neighbors and friends and family.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Please do not respond to any emails you get from this message. If you want to baby sit, talk to your parent's friends or people you know from your neighborhood, church, school, etc.    Seriously, the internet is full of some weird people.  This is not a good way to get a bay sitting gig.|`|8KZ7HKgvaa	Oh! You mean BabySITTER|`|AA11348933	I'm sure that you mean baby sitter and not "sister".      This is not a good idea to get baby sitting jobs here.  Maybe you could try posting an ad at the local community center and have your parents go with you while your customers interview you.
9OsjdsrZaa	First you need to think of your babies immediate needs.  Food, Clothing, Diapers, Wipes, Diaper Rash lotion, a place to wash, car seat, and a place to sleep.  Then expound on these things.    Food - Do you nurse, or do you need formula.  How many bottles will you need?  Will you have a good supply of clean water to make formula?  Do you have burp rags...etc.    Clothing - Temp. of where you are going?  How many outfits does your baby need in one day, then through in an extra for each day...traveling can be messy.  Do you need extra layers...or less.  Will you have access to a Washing Machine...(do you need to bring Dreft?)    Diapers - How many does your baby go through in one day?  Bring extra!  Or can you buy them when you get there?    Wipes - Expect the messes.  Extra is always best.  Can you buy the brand you like where you are going?    Diaper Rash Lotion - Traveling is stressful for Mom's and babies.  Diaper rashes can crop up suddenly and take over before you know it.  Be prepared.    A place to wash - Are you planning on bathing your baby while you are gone?  If so, the Huggies pre-soaped wash clothes are great for travel.    Car Seat - Are you traveling by plane?  When you get to your destination, will you need a car seat?  Can you rent one?  Do you even WANT to rent one?    A place to sleep - Do you need to bring a port-a-crib?  Do you have their bed-time routine items?  Blankets?  Pajamas?  etc.    For each location you go, you may need different items.  Sit down and think of your babies routines and build on them.  That is my best advice.  Good Luck!|`|X2G8EHBlaa	well number one a car seat!  diapers, wipes, formula if your not breast feeding, bottles with water in them, blankets, two extra pairs of clothes just in case something happens...more if you are going out for a long time, toys he or she can play with, teething gel just in case, medicine..infant motrin and tylenol, bibs, diaper rash ointment, teething ring just in case, baby cereal and baby food because your baby is four months old he or she should be to that stage...spoons..hats for the cold...mittens....snow suit or buddle them up very well if you hve to make a check list just to make sure you dont leave anything.|`|kLYoRiFeaa	u got it easy!!! i jsut flew from mass to az with my one year old....hahaha i wanted to kill myself!!!! he was so rotten...and cranky and wanted to walk everywhere and went up to strangers and talked to them.....allu really need is the diaper bag filled with more than enough diapers to last, formula- not mixed, bring bottles filled with water  so u can jsut mix it when he need one. they test it if its mixed. also a blanket, sum toys, magazine for u and his car seat incase u can get him a seat or u can gate check it ( i am assuming u are flying u didnt say wat kind of travel) also a small stroller to push him until u get to the entrance of the plane then gate check it and u will get it back when landing right at the gate....also u can call the airline and ask them also bring his birth certificate...babies under 2 can fly free on ur lap.|`|MthIvBZ3aa	you will definitely need:    *pretty much every bottle he/she has so you won't have to keep washing them out, it's easier just to take all of them, or at least 8 depending on the length of your trip  *formula  *bibs  *onesies and pajamas  *teething rings/tablets  *a few toys that make noise  *blankets  *coat or jacket  *diapers and wipes  *diaper rash cream (you never know what may happen)  *overnight diaper bag and going out diaper bag  *washcloth and soap/shampoo  *books for night time reading    uhhh...i think that's about it! hope this helps! :o)
gZ0NPuleaa	Get your doctor to refer you to a specialist. Pronto.|`|bqehqlFHaa	You feed him whatever he will eat.  His miserable because he's hungry! I don't care what the doc. said......feed that baby!!|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I have an almost 3 year old niece who is just now getting to 25lbs. It didn't slow her down developmentally any. If he likes table food and is still eating formula or breast milk then let him. He's old enough for most of it and it won't hurt him.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Breast or Bottle?   What is his intake in a day?   He NEEDS solids and as much as he is willing to eat!|`|hieQHR0daa	You really need to look at his diet. At his age there is no good reason why he shouldn't be eating alongside his family as long as there is no added salt or sugar in his food. I think you should ask for a Pediatric opinion as he should have doubled his birth weight by now. He could have a metabolic disorder and this needs to be checked out.  If he wasn't gaining weight but was very active then he would require more calories and a dietary review would help.  General family doctors are not specialists, when it comes to children someone with more experience is more valuable. Either see a Pediatrician or ask a Health Visitor for a feeding assessment.|`|hTQg5tgPaa	I would definitely go to a specialist as soon as possible, should have at least doubled weight by now (every child is different, but I think that this is a little on the extreme side).  Better to be safe than sorry, there could be an undetected problem.  I don't want to freak you out but that just does not sound healthy, especially since he has no energy.  I have a friend and hers has gone to a specialist cause hers is so small, but her child is very active and the doctors say that the baby is just a small petit child and everything is ok - but even she got hers checked out by a specialist (& at that point hers weighed more than that).    Breastfeeding won't cause a child to not gain weight, mine gained all too well - was nursed strictly for first 6 months (weighed almost 19 lb at the time), she really didn't want food until 8 months.  I just don't think that he's getting enough milk... if you are breastfeeding... they say that there is enough neutition in your milk to sustain a baby solely for a year (except iron) as long as you are eating enough to sustain you and the child and healthy.  I wouldn't suggest it, I think that it is just for theory.  They told my friend the same thing with her breastfeeding, cause her's is so small - to still breastfeed on demand along with food & hers is over a year.|`|AA10949064	This may sound crazy - but is he getting enough fluids?  It is very common for children that age to become dehydrated.  If he's not getting enough fluids, he can become very weak, therefore, not eating as much as needed and not gaining the correct amount of weight.    He should definitely be eating table food at 7 months!!!  I wouldn't see that doctor anymore.  You can't give a 7 month old only formula/breast milk and expect him to gain weight.     Just keep feeding him whatever foods he likes to eat.  As long as he eats and get the correct amount of fluids, he should eventually fill out.|`|OZ474DMYaa	breast fed? if so then make sure that you are taking in enough calories. I did this with my son the first month, i didnt take in enough and he didnt gain well at all (due to a medical issue with myself).     bottle fed? make sure he is getting enough during the day. my almost 6 month old is eating one solid meal a day and about 6 oz of formula every 2-2 1/2 hours.     also make sure he is getting plenty of tummy time and work with him holding things and sitting up. that should help with the strength. if you dont see any improvement soon then I would take him to the doctor. I would actually take him anyway in case there is an underlying problem. good luck.
4YfehneDaa	Some people spot throughout their 1st trimester, dont give up hope yet!!  Ill be pulling for you to get a positive!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	19 days of spotting would indicate you are not pregnant, I'm sorry.  Some light spotting for a day or two happens to many women in early pregnancy due to implantation or irritation of the cervix, but certainly not 19 days of it.|`|3sGtibk5aa	Hmmm i suggest you just wait until you get your results.    I ovulated on the 24th of January, also had sex on that day too.   I am 2 days late for my Period, which never happens, having mild cramping, and alot of discharge. I'll be taking a test in a few days!  I hope i get a Positive!    good luck for you too :-)  xx|`|e3mf7sw6aa	Well, when I was still unaware that I was pregnant, about 4/6wks into it...I had spotting for 21 days straight.    So, it is possible. Lots of women have spotting and such during their 1st trimester. Just be sure to keep an eye on it and contact your Dr. if you have any concerns.    Good Luck =)|`|gD2Jm3z6aa	Hi,not sure you might be most like it you are.
9m2opi6xaa	peekaboo!!!  its a major one and babies love to play   also using her hands to clap out pat a cake    talk to her when you do things such as changing her clothes tell her what your doing as you go through the motions my little man loves that    and always when your leaving a room tell her bye bye     she'll love it|`|Z76lgdrDaa	In some cities you can get a free parent educator that comes to your home and meets with you and baby, gives you handouts and suggestions on develpmental activities you can do to stimulate your baby's growth etc in the major 5 areas of development. This is available in some cities across the US through Parents as Teachers. Their concept is that parents are the first teachers and I think that is very true. It's a good program that I had experience with personally when I had the first of my several children. It's really good for a first time mom or if you're especially concerned about your baby's developmental delays. You get ideas and support when you really can use it. Also, even if this is not available in your city, you can still go to their website and you can sign up for their newsletters which they say will give suggested developmental activities that will address the different areas of development. Also, they list some recommended books/resources by baby's month of age range that you can buy or check out from a library to read to your baby and help their language and visual development.
e1fb375e8479e5154875d80338c91e3aaa	He is telling you like it is and then lying when things calm down.  Especially if it ALWAYS is said.|`|kQC4HX6vaa	Stop the games and name-calling.  This gets you no where but back to square one.    This is your button, and he knows how to push it.    But honestly - if you guys aren't married, there's no reason for him to stay committed to you.  He can admire the baby from a distance, but men just don't bond with babies like women do.  It's sad, but true.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	well if he doesnt mean it he shouldnt say it. does he not realise how upset that could make you hearing that while pregnant with his child. you should really talk about it with him and just let him know that even if its something to say to hurt your feelings while fighting that he shouldnt because the more he says it the more your gonna start believing it.
3XFZHhWgaa	Its totally normal to get cramping and dizzy like then when you argue, because when you argue and bickering, sometimes yelling, you are straining your muscles. It like when a pregnant woman sneezes she sometimes gets cramping from it. I dont think this is gonna hurt your baby as long as their is no bleeding invloved...but then again, try to stay happy so baby is happy!|`|nzgZR6onaa	This stress will harm your babies little nervous system. Seek counseling. Or you will have a crying baby when it is born.When you are emotionally upset so is your baby.It's a proven scientific fact and there has been many studies to substantiate this.|`|xq8Kn7Phaa	ITS YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE RISING   IT CAN HARM YOUR BABY AND SEND YOU INTO EARLY LABOR   DRINK SOME JUICE WHEN THIS HAPPENS SIT DOWN COOL DOWN I UNDERSTAND UR STILL MAD AND YOU HAVE ALL THE RIGHT IN THE WORLD TO BE MAD ABOUT ANYTHING WHILE UR PREGNANT AND BLOW ANYTHING UP IF UR PARTNER IS ANYTHING LIKE MY HUSBAND HE DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE ABOUT HORMONES OR UNDERSTAND THE WORD SHUT UP OR QUIT LET ME WIN AND STOP STRESSING ME     GOOD LUCK
fL6jNee5aa	Take a deep breath, im sure you're family, especially your mother will be disappointed however the damage is done.  Im sure once your child is here, just like with your daughter they will fall in love with him or her.  Just be honest with your family, make sure you let them have their say but inform them that ultimately it is your decision.   I wish you luck.  and not to be cruel, but maybe you should be thinking about birth control.|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	Use protection  tell her right away|`|FLOjzbKEaa	tell her same way you told before, as this is not new for her anymore.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	you're just going to have to be confident in your decisions and stick to it.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	just tell her the same way you did the first time|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	I have two kids whom are 14 months apart( found out I was pregnant when my son was 5 months old) Just say it. Its not like it is your 1st so they already got the news. So what about what people say or think. You keeping the baby. Hell don't say anything and wait until your belly is huge and just walk in like "HEY Y'ALL" that would be funny. Just say I have already made my decision on this so the only reason for me to bring this up is to let you know. Im not asking for your opinion but I am pregnant again. Im not sure if you can be blunt like that but that's how I did it.|`|X40Ww89qaa	tell her you are gay and pregnant, then say just kidding...but you are really pregnant|`|DNygQdmVaa	just do it.  get it overwith, theyll have to get over it and they will|`|hat60KYXaa	Yeah use a condom next time.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	Its a baby, not a terminal illness, and the quicker you figure that out and stop acting like you're 'breaking the news' to people the better.

Good luck with that and congratulations on your blessings!!! remember, everything happens for a reason!!!|`|3SIRKIBaaa	I'm in the same situation. My son is still a baby and I'm pregnant right now. I just came out and told my parents. To me it's best because they can help you if you need it. I'm still scared about my husband and I raising two children that are going to be around the same age but look at it this way, you made a VERY unselfish and brave decision to keep your baby. With that alone I'm sure God will send you MANY blessings to you and your new family. Don't worry, it'll all work out for the best. Congratulations!|`|029366e443f706114f76140b91711233aa	I think a great reassurance for her would be to hear "We are getting married...and we are expecting another precious miracle!"    You need to have a committed, stable relationship if you want to have a chance to successfully raise your babies in a nurturing and positive environment.    Believe me, I'm not judging....been there, done that.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	Tell her that grandmother looked so good on her the first time that you wanted to bless her again. :)     Seriously, don't worry.

BE RESPONSABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|mFYBg5BKaa	Wow, 18, and 2 kids by 2 different guys... you sound like my son's mom except she now has 3 kids by 3 different guys and she is 22!     You are and an adult, they should be ok with it. Are you still living at home? If so, it might be time for you to get your own place or move in with the boyfriend. Good luck.|`|AA12361841	be honest. say you have decided that the father of ur first child is not what u have chosen for ur path in life. You are of age. live life on ur own terms*|`|3d0512a158369fd82c304a8c1f4e0dc1aa	You and your, uh, boyfriend need to discuss a financial plan to raise two children, where you plan to live, work, etc. Come up with a solid plan on what your going to do, and present it to your family. That way they can be happy about knowing that the child can grow up in a good, healthy environment. If youi have any doubt that you will not be able to afford things that the baby needs, or you might neglect the child in anyway, I would consider adoption. If I had a child that I couldn't support, I would want it to grow up with a family that could love it and give it the life it needs.  but as far as breaking the news to your family, I would talk to my boyfriend about it, and come up with a finance plan.  Good luck, and God bless! :)|`|5JbARGHraa	The second time will be easier. Just tell her you know what you've done and you're ready to take on you responsibilities. Make sure this new guy is in it for the long run. Think about your child and your unborn child|`|cDjWONryaa	Take an asprin and put in between your knees and hold it there with only your knees.  (next time you think your going to have sex)    18 you should be more focused on life and establishing your identity in the world not worrying about raising 2 kids.  I mean look at the first one you not even with  (The baby daddy) no more.  You young kids need to wake up.  Its a child not a puppy!!!|`|DrrycTYGaa	You know what i think you should get it over with. She might be mad at first but she will get over it and might be really glad that the babys dad still wants to be there and help you take care of the baby. Just be honest with her and dont hide it because it will only make it worse and she will be more mad.|`|LiPoEBenaa	Don't listen to the negative comments on here. I have to commend you for actually keeping the baby. A lot of girls in your position would run to the nearest abortion clinic and never think twice. I would just be open and honest in your decision when you tell your mom. You are obviously doing the best thing! She may be mad at first, or even disapprove and want you to not keep the baby. In the end it's her grandchild, and if she wants a good relationship with it, she will have to come to terms with everything. At least you have a responsible man who cares about you and your new addition to your family!  Congrats and Good Luck sweetie!|`|74QEDymVaa	be like hey guess what...im adding another disater to this worlds population!|`|onOZ76esaa	i say if you can handle it and afford it..go for it.. otherwise, i think you know what should happen. be careful and best of luck.|`|fktK0xOVaa	my sister is 16 and got pregnant. What she did was emailed my mom when she was at school and whren both of them got home..they talking about it. it turned out ok.|`|WWCJejnYaa	You are 18 so you are an adult and should make the decision that is best for you and your children. It is nice to have the support of family but you have to do what is best for you. I am not a fan of abortion but think adoption is respectable if you cant provide for your child. I would suggest some form of birth control after the pregnancy until you are ready, if at all, for another child. Children should always be wanted and loved. Good luck.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	wow, people are sure being mean to you about it. Dont listen to them! It can be stressful having to tell your parents about this but remember that even if they're upset at first, once they realize you guys are serious about it, they'll come around and be happy for you. It is their grandchild after all.
excWX9bnaa	By not technically being on the pill do you mean that you were on the pills in the pack which do not contain hormone? If so, that shouldn't make a difference.  If you have been consistently taking your pills and not skipping days for 5 months, then it is probably 98% that you are NOT pregnant. Although if you are really concerned and you have not been consistent in taking your pills, then you can call your doctor for the morning after pill.|`|YFPMcHCbaa	None of the people on here will be able to tell you if you're pregnant. All the symptoms you get during pregnancy can also be associated with something else.    Go to the doctor, take a test, or do some research.

DRb4Qlypaa	They have to hold your position for 6 weeks if you are in the U.S. under the Family Medical Leave Act.  I can't tell you about keeping your job. If it is stressing you out then the obvious choice for your health would be to leave. But then again, you have a family to think about. Would your family suffer if you left your job? Those are questions to ask yourself before you chose, ultimately it is your decision but I do want to add that if I was financially sound enough to quit, I would do so immediately.  Good luck!|`|o8xNTVWTaa	i would be gone in a second|`|9vgZNLP8aa	If you can afford it then quit. It's so not worth it! When I was around 3 months pregnant with my first I quit my job because the stress was not good for my baby at all.      At one point my manager was being so mean to me because I asked him to pick up a really heavy box that when I got home that night I sat down and just cried. Thats when I decided that me and my baby deserved so much better than that crap hole. I talked it over with my husband and we decided I should just quit. We had to make a few financial sacrifices but it was worth it.|`|fVpRVofLaa	Find another job & quit!|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	Can you afford to quit this job? If yes then quit. Or wait until u find a better job then quit so you will have a back up.
ZNhP3mpUaa	Nope... urine tests at the Doc are generally 99.999999999 accurate... if you are pregnant.. play the lottery... sorry... good luck for the next try though!|`|3XFZHhWgaa	If you missed your period 3 months, then you would have a definite pregnancy test that is a YES! I dont think you are pregnant, maybe something is going on with your period...go to the doc to see why your not getting your period. If the doctor only did a urine test, maybe ask for a blood test because even doctors urine test could be false...Mine was as the doctors and my blood test came out positive.|`|jNYEi0CTaa	3 months?  Have you talked to your doctor about this?  You're not pregnant.  But you shouldn't be missing that many periods|`|NLxCpn8iaa	I think the only way to tell for sure is to have a quantitative Hcg level drawn at your doctor's office.|`|7IHMjy2caa	Unlikely but possible.    I took two hpt's (negative), a planned parenthood urine test (negative) and then a few months later found out I was pregnant with my daughter the whole time.     Explain your concerns to your doctor and ask for further tests to find out why you have missed so many periods.|`|6yy0jtzDaa	Nope must be some other health problem  when your pregnant your hormones skyrocket which is what is dectected on pregnancy tests! like 10 times after your 6th week so by 3 months its should very simple to see if you are|`|s56Hv7BSaa	no. you probably have to get you period induced

veO1RXrCaa	Are you a simpleton?  Have you never heard of the birth control pill/patch/shot?  Why take a chance like that?  This makes me mad bc its EMERGENCY contraception.  Not for whatever we want it for contraception.|`|0wTzlG2haa	How about having her go on the pill and wait to have condomless sex for a period of time until her system has time to adjust to the pill? Honestly I think that is a better idea than relying on Plan B as a contraceptive...which it's not.|`|bnQ7im8Caa	plan b is not to be use as birth control. if you want to try having sex with out a condom she needs to be on birth control. but even with that its not 100%. so if your not ready to be parents. stick with the condom and be safe.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	Plan B is really just for "accidents'.  You can try spermicidal film or supositories.  They are sold next to condoms and lube.  She can put a peice of film (looks like seran wrap) inside of her and then it kind of melts and provides the protection.  The supository is the same.  It goes inside her and melts into a spermidice.  If you are in the USA, she can go to Planned Parenthood and get on the regular pill for pretty cheap and that offers the best protection.  If you don't go on the regular pill but just use the film or supository, then I would advise that you pull out before you climax since you want as little sperm as possible inside of her so that nobody sneaks thru and makes it to the finish line.  If you keep using Plan B every time, it will mess up her cycle and won't be good for her body since the high dose of hormones will shock her system each time.|`|IllWKAUGaa	dude, she should use birth control, its the same thing as plan b. but it's preventative, not for the case of emergencies. plan b. isn't always effective either, it works 77% of the time, which is the same as the pullout method (and might i add how many pull out babies there are out there....tooo many)...the pill is 96-98% effective when taken perfectly. it is just as easy to get as plan b. dont rely on plan b. if she already ovulated before taking it she will get pregnant. and theres no way to pinpoint the exact moment of ovulation. dont be stupid, use protection because even when people use birth control they still get pregnant.....nothing is 100%, if you dont want a baby don't be stupid.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	Well, first your girlfriend should get on birth control. There are still possibilities though so maybe some spermicidal lube.    And trust me, once you try sex once without a common you are opening a whole can of worms... once will turn into twice, which will turn into three times and wel....you get the point. so I would talk to your gf about birth control and keep in mind that even on the pill, there are still risks.    But coming from somone who has taken Plan B before in the case of an emergency, depending on your views about abortion and emergency contraceptives and what not, a lot of guilt can be tied up with taking that pill. It was an emotional rollercoaster for me after taking it. so I would say no, do not use it unless you MUST.|`|e8HCEZDpaa	Umm ever heard of birth control? Plan B is not birth control and should not be used as such. Tell her to get on the pill or some other form if you are going to be stupid enough to have sex without a condom.|`|jNYEi0CTaa	That and you could get spermacide. Check in with places like Planned Parenthood, they can give you tips and ideas.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	No its not. Try the pills or shot or something like that.|`|dRo89MsYaa	tell her to try the depo=provera shot or mirena. they're better than the pill because you don't have to remember them every day.|`|n9BgxcPcaa	Sure bithcontrol helps a lot but some people are allergic to it. EEk.|`|HpCmmlMFaa	There are many different types of contraceptives out there. If your girlfriend does like the idea of going on the pill then she could get a contraceptive implant this can stay in up to 10 years i think and can  be taken out anytime by a doctor. This is great if you and your girlfriend don't want to have any children any time soon. There is also a new contraceptive called the patch. It's just like a patch a smoker would wear while trying to quite. Its skin coloured so it is very noticeable and can be stuck anywhere on the body. You would have to ask your doctor about this method as well. Your doctor would also be able to give you more methods and opinions.  Hope this helped :)|`|5xmH6HDeaa	plan B is not able to prevent pregnacy and is not a birth control use birth control and and   1.how do you know for SURE that your partner hasn't done it   2. are you a responsable adult that can take care of a child if somthing goes wrong?  3. last but NOT least --  do you know that you can be born with STD\STI's??? have you both been tested .....im not an adult im a teenager but i know what im talking about....and im not aginst sex....im just sayin|`|NLj70oJIaa	Just do it! ONE time wont hurt!! Consider birth control. Condomless sex is the best, You wont stop i Promise.
WPI0Z47saa	You cannot take advil while pregnant! Nothng with asprin. Tylenol is safe and so is tylenol pm. Here are a list of meds that are FDA approved for Pregnancy.|`|6857hnxjaa	read the labels on the bottles.  most of those 'pm' medications have the same drug as benedryl which is what makes you feel tired.  it's not a very good drug, a hold over from the 80s which is why it is sold over the counter.    there is probably something better and safer you can take, so ask your doctor.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	Tylenol PM is fine to take while pregnant... the other two medications, are not... so if you have back pain or cramps, until you find out if you are pregnant or not, only take tylenol!!! Good luck and as long as you have stopped taking the other medications everything should be fine!!!
LiPoEBenaa	Your baby probably dropped. It can happen anywhere from 2-4weeks before the onset of labor for 1st time mommies! I know when it happened to me I had those same exact symptoms! If it continues to really bother you though, I would call the doctor just in case. He/She may want to do a cervical exam to make sure you aren't dilating or anything like that! I still have a lot of pressure in my pelvis, but the really sharp pain in my back went away. I can also breathe better! Anyways, you're almost there! Good luck and Congrats!|`|VUss5AfAaa	you droped hun..im 38 weeks and 5 days today..and im still having pelvic pain and back pain and uterous pressure..especially when i go to the restroom.    its normal.  onless you expirience a bloody show or you are leaking fluid call your doctor..but other than that your safe.    good luck.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	Possibly, all I know is that I am 22 weeks pregnant and I was having the same pelvic pain and pressure. My doctor did a sono and said that my little girl loves to sit really low and that is what causes the pelvic pressure. I can only assume if that is the case for you and your baby is bigger than mine that it is also pressing on your back which is why you have both back and pelvic pain!! :) Good luck!
Wc3Vge9taa	my guess is the november 11...|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Around the 12, maybe the 14th.|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	nov 12/13|`|TCGLe8sdaa	google due date calculator... go into one of the links and put in da date of ur last period and ur due date and conception date will *** up...|`|eb9Mptu3aa	November 11 OR 12 would be most likely, because most women ovulate about 14 days after the first day of their period. Don't discount November 8 either.|`|5WYeHh0paa	go to amazingpregnancy.com and enter your LMP and it will tell you when you conceived along with many other interesting dates!
52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Yes. I end my placebo pills every Saturday and I usually don't start my period until at least Tuesday or Wednesday (it last for 4 or 5 days).    So yes, this is normal. Stress will push your period back regardless of whether or not you're on birth control.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Yup, it's normal,,, I was on birth control for about 2 years when I would always get my period a little earlier than the placebos... example, if my first day of placebos was the 15th, i would get my period around the 10th or 11th....   After awhile, it evened out and now I get my period 4  to 5 days into the placebos... (aka if 15th was the last day, i'd get it around the 20th)... And i found as soon as that happened, my periods also got much shorter.. went from around 8 days down to 4. It was a really sudden change but it's great :D.... I don't think you have anything to worry about :)|`|yjVcK52Zaa	yeah its normal
OU9xnW86aa	Clearly, at least 18 weeks. But the gender can be seen as early as 16 weeks.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	It's best to wait until about 20 weeks- anything sooner than that might be too soon to tell.|`|0850e5b6b05b382346ca9aedac686538aa	I got to know mine in 22weeks.But i think u can know it as soon as 18 weeks.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	everybody's different but they usually do an ultrasound when you're 20 weeks and try to tell you then.

AA11920812	YES.    Mine got wider and longer.    I used to be a 7 or 7 1/2 and now am a full size bigger. Even after pregnancy. You can still buy the cute pointy toed shoes and boots just a bigger size. I went to Penneys when they had a buy one get one for a penny sale.

cYRZpGkqaa	The skull bones aren't fused together so that the head will fit through the birth canal. If a baby's head is engaged for a few days before the birth it may take a little longer to reshape. However, most infant's head take on a more natural, rounded shape within the first few days of life. Hope this helps!|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	It had to pass through a hole that's only 10 cm wide.  Babies born by c-section don't have funny looking heads like babies born vaginally.|`|4MjSgjAAaa	bacause it gets pushed through the birth canal|`|PBI3tCKaaa	Well, it had to be soft at first so it could fit through the mothers vagina.|`|PYSMK0JBaa	newborns heads are not hard bones like an adults head. They have to be able to manipulate so they can fit through the birth canal.|`|0VHolTVEaa	Because when it comes through the birth canal its squashed and needs molding. The best way to shape it again is buy a head pillow especially designed for new borns to reshape the head. This also helps when they have flat heads after lying in one position for a long period of time|`|2cstdEkIaa	it became odd shaped while passing through the birth canal|`|AA11297232	Because their skull has not formed properly yet. I presume.|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	there are kindo triangle because they have been pushed through a small hole and there skull over laps at the top.and they are flat at the back because they spend so much time lieing on it.   x|`|7cbnFfIdaa	if a baby is born vaginally the head looks weird because it had to squeeze through the birth canal and may look cone shaped. my daughter was a c-section and her head looked normal.|`|NSBL9bDFaa	the bones in a babys skull are not fused together yet, they are like puzzle pieces, and they push together to fit the baby through the birth canal and then they go back to normal a few days or a few hours later, (the reason for the soft spot on babys head)|`|AA10371609	The bones in the skull are nice and soft so that the baby can pass through the birth canal. They usually slide into place and begin to harden within a few days after birth.|`|B7PPM92caa	Because when the baby come out its pressing against the pelvic bone to get here, so the baby head is soft it can be shaped if the mother take the time everyday, but she needs to do it softly the shape should come to look normal.
OU9xnW86aa	She might pee her pants a little. I suggest she wear a pad. Pregnant women are a little incontinent. Other than that I don't see any problem. Have fun!|`|AA10371609	She might wet herself a little, but she'll be fine.  There are no side effects from laughter that I know of other than having a wonderful time.    Stop worrying!!  Go be silly at the show and enjoy yourselves!|`|44OH7Si6aa	she should wear a pad, or at least a pantyliner since she is at the stage where urine leakage becomes an issue especially when laughing or coughing. Other than that, she'll be fine.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	............    She's fine. Laughing doesn't hurt anything. If it did our bodies wouldn't allow us to laugh during pregnancy.|`|AA11220327	tell her to maybe wear a pad, a lot of laughter durring pregnancy can make you have little accidents! lol, along with sneezing, coughing etc, lol|`|akB0gV20aa	She'll be fine.  It will probably be good for her!|`|xif22nwoaa	There is no danger in laughing a lot.|`|bNA5BuKCaa	No, she will be ok.
IAM1O7Hlaa	are thinking keeping the baby? well I guess is going to be hard but, if your question is how to know who is the dad? you need DNA test, and I am sorry but is going to be difficult to stop those 3 guys to not think you are slut like you say, so just be strong and face this is you are deciding to be a mom, just talk with each man, and tell that you are pregnant and need a DNA test, and dont expect they are going to react with flowers and chocolates, they are going to freak out and not be very excited about it.    good luck.    and i am not calling you slut ok? everybody is the own writer of his/her life.|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	OH my,  well  firstly you can find out the day you concevied by searching the "date of conception"on google.  secondly at the birth if the baby is mixed race you'll no and if its white then you can exclude the black guy and have a DNA test.  what ever you do not be embaressed, dont tell them all that they are the dads tell them they could be but theres 2 others aswell.  Dont panic theres far worse people out there!  good luck x|`|a7ciEFgvaa	Call me rude but how big are the chances that the baby's father is black?  If you don't think so, then go for the odds that the kid is white (mothers have a special instinct, try your mothers gut) and if it's white, then do this.  Nobody really knows (if your a man) if their child is really theres, because half the time a child belongs to another man but the husband ends up raising that child (really, google it, there are crazy stories out there) tell the guy you love it's his.  That's what I'd do, but lukily that would never happen to me.|`|g2dFUkvbaa	apparently you can pay to have a DNA test done in the early stages of pregnancy, so you can have an abortion if its not the daddy you want.    use a rubber next time!!!!!!|`|u9KvmkaJaa	when the baby comes out, you will be able to scratch at least one off your list, maybe two if the baby is black. have the other guy you do not love take a test to determine if he is the father. than u will have your answer.|`|J3TRJPIwaa	Everyone is right.

Periods are sometimes late. Periods are sometimes skipped. Hell, I even skipped on while on birth control pills. As for the symptoms, you may just be experiencing them because you are looking for them. This is very common. Planned parenthood doesn't do blood tests to diagnos pregnancy, they just use test strips that you could do at home.    If you miss another period, go back and find out what is wrong. Missing multiple periods in a row could be a sign of a problem.|`|iyL6dyMyaa	Go down to your DFS office and get on Medicaid, then pick one of the 4 insurance they offer you, I have HealthCare USA, and then get it checked out.

hVVALFAPaa	OK Michael, you are a guy and probably never had an epidural.    Yes, the epidural hurts a little bit but not even as much as getting blood drawn.     Most doctors will spray your back with a cool anesthetic that is more of a shock than pain. The needle stick is just that, a stick. It hurts no more or worse than a blood draw. There are some weird feelings along your spine but they do not hurt--they just feel odd.    The worst part about the epidural is that you have to try to curl into a ball so that your spine stretches out. It is HARD to curl into a ball when you have a 7 or 8 pound baby in front of you!    The epidural is the least uncomfortable thing that you are going to have to deal with during labor.    Good luck! And congratulations!!!|`|uxwSd0KLaa	Don't worry you want feel nothing|`|44OH7Si6aa	It really depends on the person and your reaction to pain and needles. It isn't fun, it's very uncomfortable when they do it but afterward you are fine. Getting it is scary but I think it is more of a mental thing for most people, the best thing you can do is focus on something else and don't move.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	the epidural is an injection into your spinal fluid, done correctly as with any injection it will NOT hurt, don't worry and congratulations|`|28fNd725aa	Dont listen to all that ..... It hurts like getting any other shot.. but what you feel is when they numb your skin you dont feel the actual eppi'.    I had a c-section with my last pregnancy and I was way freaking out to... but really not all that bad!!    Good luck and congrats!!|`|7ES4xMloaa	no they numb it first, it isnt comforable but not painfull either|`|Icwz678Qaa	Well, it doesn't hurt like having a C-Section without it.    But, don't worry my sisters, daughter as well as my husband have had epidurals and they have never had any kind of pain while getting one or after.    Be Blessed:-)|`|LpJ9TLNBaa	No, but sticking a blunt instrument such as a spoon into your urethra certainly does!!   Trust me, i have been there...|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	You know, I don't really remember.  I had epidurals with my first two deliveries (and actually with the first delivery, they had to put it back in b/c it fell out), but because the labor pains were so bad, I didn't notice the epidural at all.    Is this your first baby?  Is there a reason you're having a c-section rather than a vaginal delivery?|`|okp0CMc3aa	my epidural with my first was fine, didnt feel a thing, then with the second it was a nightmare, the anesthesiologist kept missing & didnt put enough freezing in. it really depends. i would speak to your doctor about your concerns, he or she can put your mind at ease.|`|bK5f2p38aa	I had the epidural with my first and was natural birth, im having it again, with all the pain i was having, it didn't hurt at all, everything went smooth, Good luck, but why are you having a c-section?|`|dPmK83UYaa	not really...it's like anyother shot....it feels wierd and may make you feel queasy if it's not done right, but doctors are pretty good at it now. they have to put it in when ur having contractions so the contractions actually hurt way more than the shot so...for the split second the shot hurts- it is WAY worth it.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	No. It felt like a cold pin prick to numb you and then the rest you can't feel. The worst part was the catheter. It hurt every time I moved an inch until they took it out.|`|nbSp469Waa	I don't know about all these other people, but I have had 3 babies and NOT ONE of my epidurals hurt.  I had all 3 put in on the first try too.  I have many friends that have had them too, and only one of them had problems with hers.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	That depends.  With my first c-section, I'd been in labor for 36 hours.  They could have pounded nails into my spine and I wouldn't  have noticed or cared--so, that one didn't hurt at all.  My second c-section was scheduled.  That epidural wasn't too pleasant--but it was a different anesthesiologist and I thought he was a jerk.  And it wasn't really pain when they did it--just kind of a creepy feeling like something was touching my spinal cord and it shouldn't be touching it.  That's what I remember, anyway; this was 23 years ago.  No matter what, don't be terrified.  It won't be as bad as whatever you're imagining.|`|vmnOzqJraa	Some people experience pain with an epidural. I personally did not have any. The anesthesiologist numbs the site before placing the epidural catheter.    Everyone's different, but I did feel it. My anesthesiologist didn't numb the area beforehand, though. They had me sit on the edge of the bed, bend over (as much as is possible at this point!) and during the height of a contraction, inserted the needle quickly. Someone held me in a full nelson, so I couldn't move, even if I wanted to. With this technique, you are experiencing pain in a different area already, and since your brain can't fully focus on one pain only, the new pain, which is the epidural, isn't really felt because you are already focusing on the contraction, so both pains seem to be dulled. Kind of a sensory overload. If you are asking this question because you are afraid of what pain will come with child birth, fear not! Usually by the time they give you the epidural, your contractions are so painful that you will actually beg for the epidural. Not to scare you, but anesthesiologists seem to be in very high demand, so if you want one, I would ask slightly before you feel you need it. You might find you won't need it-- every woman's different. As soon as you get that piece of heaven, also known as an epidural, ALL pain is gone, and you can rest before you need to push. If you opt not to have the epidural, it has been my experience that the pain goes away entirely when you begin to push. Maybe it's the endorphins; I don't know. But I DO know that I am a big crybaby when it comes to pain, and the epidural sounds scarier than it really is. I have had a few kids, and with my second, contractions never got painful at all, and even though I ended up needing a c-section, when they gave my the epidural, it didn't hurt, only a quick pinch. If you have ever had a needle from the dentist, then you've gone through worse! Oh, and after, make sure they remove the tape and the catheter slowly so they don't pull off a layer of skin. The adhesive tends to be a little strong! You'll have enough to deal with after the baby is born; you don't need a scraped up back on top of it. Good luck, you will do great, and you won't even remember it after.|`|jvLsrtBNaa	YES! like a mother! i don't think i've ever experienced anything more painful....sorry|`|jeYL4S5Zaa	My wife says yes. But just for a second or so then it all goes numb.|`|GOvZ1wi0aa	YESS!!!!!!!!!! But your so scared about the baby you dont really think about it!|`|zFqWCOmaaa	I haven't had one but my cousin did and she said it didn't hurt it was just uncomfortable. The pain of contractions were worse|`|MH7LT9beaa	I think it depends on your anesthesiologist with both my kids it did not hurt at all just pressure. they usually numb you with a tiny needle before they put the big one in your spine. u will be fine|`|SBJNJEBBaa	you know it does hurt, but its worht it and it doesnt hurt the whole time just when they put it in, i was going to say that the contractions hurt so bad that the epidural is nothing when it comes to contractions but since you are having a c section it will be different, it only is a minute or two of pain but so worth it in the end|`|W0gMQVoDaa	difficult for me to answer because i have had epidurals when i was in labour and no it didnt hurt at all compared to the contractions xx|`|0NCXfwKbaa	the epidural was the scariest thing for me going into my labor. I was really scared of having the needle. My nurse held me in her arms and my anistiologist numbed the skin first and let it soak in then it only took her like 1 minute to get the epidural in and then the medicine instantly started numbing me. It really wasnt that bad.|`|uCD0cKttaa	my wife sed it does but not as bad as having a kid the old fashion way|`|DCPKWwh6aa	I had 3 c-sections, 3 breech babies, I thought that it stings more, than it hurts, and it is not actually an epidural, it is spinal, because it numbs you more than an epidural, if you have the right person you should be okay, if you have a weak stomach or have any problems with medicine tell them you want something for when you are feeling sick , and make sure that you get up and walk when they want you to, because the more you walk, the better you will be when you go home, after having 3 c-sections I feel like I am a pro at this, my youngest is 16 months old.|`|578d3fb2ddadd63f9be866329b168f56aa	i've had an epidural for each of my pregnancies....i didn't even think twice about it.   it didn't hurt me at all, just felt a little pressure. with my 2nd one i had a bad contraction while they were putting it in, and you have to stay very still..that part stunk a little...but the epidural itself was painless for me. everybody is different and have different pain thresholds, just like some feel nauseaus from it and others don't.
vue9NOhYaa	Babies can be sensitive to anything.  Either her little belly isn't quite ready for any solids yet, or she's just reacting badly to the oatmeal.    So... try something else.  You could offer rice, or a fruit or vegetable. If she does well on that, fine.  If she continues to react badly, I'd hold off on solids for a few more weeks, to give her system a chance to mature a bit more.    EDIT:  Gluten issues aren't an allergy.  It's an intolerence.  And it's far too early to be worrying about this.  A bit of gas/diarrhea in a 5 month old just starting solids is FAR more likely to mean that she just isn't ready for solids (or that particular food), then any sort of life-long dietary limitations.|`|HvALvdc7aa	I give my daughter rice cereal in her formula in the morning and at lunch and I can definitely tell she is gassier than normal. Doesn't seem to bother her though. She is 2 months but it really helps with her reflux symptoms.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	I just called my doctor about my 7 & half month old baby's loose stool. She started solid food from 6 month & her stool got hard since then. Before she always had that breastfed baby watery poop which is normal. Recently, I added oatmeal to her diet because I always mixed rice cereal to her veggies or fruit & I thought she needed some change.     I don't know if it's the oatmeal or her teething... so many things are new to babies that we can't figure out what cause the problem. She has loose stool since last week - she had oatmeal from last week too. I stopped giving her oatmeal from yesterday so I'll see in few days.     My doctor will call me back in a day to let me know about the issue. I'll let you know.
vue9NOhYaa	I'm not clear on one thing -- why are you pumping?  The best solution to your problem would be to work with an LC to get baby to latch so you can stop pumping (which I recognize IS an amazing hassle), and just nurse your baby. At 2 weeks, it's not too late to solve whatever problems you've been having.     As for his reaction to the formula, yes, it could be making him fussy.  He might be allergic to it, or just reacting badly to some ingredient in the formula. (Are you giving one with DHA/ARA?  Many babies are upset by the DHA in formula.) Also, most formulas just plain don't taste very good.  If baby is used to breastmilk (which is very sweet), he may not want to drink the formula.    If you feel you must wean to formula, then try different formulas until you find one he can tolerate and likes.    EDIT: I'm still not entirely sure I understand your situation.  If you are pumping so you can monitor his intake -- you don't have to do that.  The way to monitor intake is to monitor output.  If he's wetting diapers and gaining weight (he should be about back to his birthweight now) then he's getting enough. And if you're able to pump 3 ounces at a time, your supply is obviously copious, so there's no reason at all to be concerned about him not getting enough.     If you're finding pumping a hassle, I would still STRONGLY recommend just nursing him rather than switching to formula.  Yes, breastfeeding is a bit time consuming in the beginning.  But once you and baby get into the swing of things, you'll probably find it very convenient --- far MORE convenient than messing with bottles and mixing and measuring.  (And much more convenient than pumping every few hours.)  You can nurse any time, any place.    But again, if you're sure you want to wean, and understand the health  implications of your choice -- then do what works for you.|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	Formula is much thicker and heavier. If you can do one just do one, their little bellies need to get used to the formula, but its hard if you keep switching back and forth, I started formula at one month because I count keep up with my son, and it took him about a week before he was used to it.|`|zwctZ812aa	He may not like the taste of the formula and that is why he won't take as much.  We tried switching my 3 month old to formula due to restrictions on my diet because I had to cut out all citrus, citric acid, and milk products, but he won't do it. We tried for 2 months and finally just gave up  If he is fussier, there could be several explanations.  First off, it is possible he is developing colic.  It usually starts between 2 and 4 weeks.  For your sake, I hope that's not it because it is so miserable.   Maybe he is having problems with the formula you switched him to.  Ask the doctor and see what he/she says.|`|rjVALevtaa	Babies know what is best for them, so of course he's going to take breast milk over formula. His fussiness is probably caused by the switch to formula. Formula is not as easy on a baby's tummy as breast milk is.     My suggestion to you is to much as much as you can for as long as you can. If you don't pump enough milk for a full bottle then mix the rest will formula. That should help him transition.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Formula isn't "thicker" than breastmilk.  Nor does it contain more calories (it contains less) nor does it contain more fat.  The sole reason that babies eat less often on formula is that it is less digestible so it stays in the stomach longer and takes more energy to digest it so they have less energy to spend on anything other than sleep.  The "average" breastfed baby over 2 months takes 25oz, the "average" formula fed baby takes 32 oz -so babies do "need" more formula.      Its easy to monitor whether a breastfed baby is getting enough.  No matter whether your baby is breastfed, bottle fed expressed milk, or bottlefed formula the oz mean NOTHING.  The question is whether the baby is peeing (ie hydrated), gaining weight, physically thriving, and not having adverse side effects (particularly from formula, but allergies to certain proteins in mom's diet can happen to breastfed babies in rare cases)    Formula fed babies take between 2-3oz per lbs of body weight per day to a maximum of 32oz, as a rule.  So a 10lbs baby takes between 20-30oz.  Some 10lbs babies thrive with 20 oz, and some would be starving and potentially even end up failure-to-thrive.  The oz mean nothing.    Formula fed babies tend to be fussier.  Formula is far more likely to cause allergies.  Formula fed babies are more likely to suffer GERD because formula is not a natural antacid, it stays in the stomach longer giving it more chance to come back, formula fed babies take more at a time and bottlefed babies are more likely to be overfed (even if it is breastmilk in the bottle).  Bottle fed babies are more likely to swallow excess gas.      Your baby won't starve.  If you are really determined to get him to drink formula instead of breastmilk he will eventually take it despite its different taste and smell.  You just have to be persistent.|`|iOSEVRPPaa	Why pump?  You can give him your breast, you know?|`|t9S0dqfLaa	It will take a while for his tummy to adjust, then he'll be fine. At least my son was and I went through pretty much the same thing you did. When does the worrying stop? ummm....never.  Welcome to motherhood, it's a great ride.|`|7XuzRloXaa	All babies adjust to things differently, obviously. I breastfed my daughter for 3 months, and then started giving her formula. She did just fine, really no "complications." I pretty much just did it cold turkey, although I did offer her the breast once a day, until I just lost my supply. She transitioned quite well.|`|AA10949064	Breast milk is specifically made for babies - so yes, it is much easier to digest.  Odds are you baby is getting gassy from the formula.  Similac does have special formulas out right now for gassy babies and fussy babies.  You could try those if you haven't already.    He's eating more breast milk because that's what tastes best to him.  After all your body is making it especially for him.    Are you trying to stop breast feeding all together?  I'm confused about why you are pumping instead of just giving him the breast and why you are giving him formula to begin with if you are breastfeeding.  You don't need to know how much he's eating - as long as he's gaining weight, he's getting enough - period.  It doesn't make any sense to feed him formula right now.  If you are breastfeeding - he should just be drinking that.|`|AA10207874	he is eating less formula because breast milk is thinner, so he will need more and need to eat more often. He may not like the Similiac also try another formula.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	it could, any time you change your babies diet it could make them fussy.

I would try again but do whatever makes you feel comfortable.  It is more important to take care of your three children!  Good luck!|`|vue9NOhYaa	I would definitely try to breastfeed again. And, before you start, line up a good lactation consultant.  She can check  your breasts now to see if there are any physical issues that might have led to such severe pain. (Usually, if there's pain, it doesn't start for a few days.) And if there are, she can offer tips in advance. (For example, if you have flat or inverted nipples that can make it hard for baby to latch, she may recommend breast shells or exercises to draw the nipple out.)    Then, when baby is born, call her right away.  She will come over and help you get started and help baby latch.  A good start is VERY important in preventing soreness. (Many hospitals have LCs on staff, but be careful. Some are good, and are board certified. Others are just nurses with (maybe) a little extra interest in breastfeeding or (maybe) have been assigned to do the job.  Nurses may or may not give good help and advice.  So, if your hospital has an LC, take advantage of her services.  But if you start having pain anyway, call that outside LC for help.)    If you do find that, despite your best efforts, you have pain that can't be prevented or treated, exclusive pumping is certainly an option. It's a lot of work and takes some dedication, but if you're able to do it, you will give your baby MOST of the benefits she'd get from nursing directly.|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	Try breastfeeding, mine also hurt lol, I think it is normal. Maybe you had a bit of blocked colostrum that needed to come out.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Agony from what? Engorgement? Bad latch?|`|AA10976444	You need to keep trying after the 24 hours.  Start using lanisoh on your nipples now to soften them up (use a breast pad to cover as it is greasy) Make sure that baby has a good latch on, and it won't hurt.|`|5793e96405109506ce7e9f6a4ff6ce46aa	aww...i think that ur babies weren't latching on properly! go to a breastfeeding support group so they can help (there should be someone at hospital especially for this) . its normal for boobs to hurt for the first 2 weeks or so (mine used to bleed..ouuuuchh!!) BUT it does get better after! my baby is now 12 weeks and i love nursing her, i don't think i want to stop ! lol  also get the lanolin cream it helps a great deal with sore nipples :)  Good luck!!|`|qStmw7qgaa	Try pumping and see if that is better.  Breast feeding really is not comfortable.  Using a warm wash cloth on them will help relieve the pain, and lanolin on the nipples is a life saver.|`|Mt5du1y1aa	Were you in agony from the start?  I never had a huge problem,except if the baby was not latched on properly. Maybe you are just very sensitive??|`|2NX67BdWaa	Ask your midwife to check you have the baby latched on properly.  the first 24 hours can be a bit painful as your milk comes in and your boobs swell to big proportions ( I fell asleep on my side and woke up with one huge boob and one normal - thought I was stuck that way but they soon evened out after 1 feed) .    Best thing to do is not to worry about it, the baby will pick up on this too - try to relax and enjoy the time - also try to go a few days, the milk does not come in at first and you may find everything changes.  good luck & enjoy being a mum.|`|F6jUJUoOaa	its very normal for your breasts to be sore when you first breast feed but after a few weeks they should be fine, i expressed milk for my son, and did that for 5 months. its doesnt matter if you decide to express it, either way he/she will be breast fed, try it, you can use some cream (around the nipple area) if its that sore. If your breasts are very sore try to massage them in warm water with soap that helps to relaive the pain, plus it helps the milk flow (for the milk to come out of breasts easier)  Most women who choose to breast feed go through that, its normal. but just do what you feel is right.  goodluck hun x|`|GYrnb7Xcaa	First of all and most importantly, don't worry or get worked up about this. It sounds like the problem you had with your first two children could have been mastitis which is when your breasts become sore and swollen often making it impossible to feed. It's not your fault and happens to many women. You can try breast feeding again but I'd have a chat to your midwife about it too. She'll be able to offer some good advice. Expressing your milk may help but could also be painful if your breast become sore again.   Your midwife is the best option, she can advise you and put you in touch with breast feeding support groups and advisers. Good luck with whatever you do!|`|AA10207874	You should take a breastfeeding class. I did and learned alot of things I didn't know. It helped a whole lot. And also in the hospital they have lactation consultants that can help you.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Definitely try breastfeeding first as this will help get your milk to come in (pumps aren't as efficient and you won't get as much milk). Start talking with a lactation consultant now and go to a local breast feeding support group before the baby comes to get an idea of how other moms have gotten through it and where you can go for support once your little one is here.     I breastfed my son exculsively for almost 2 months and then I switched to pumping and giving him bottles (I was having a really hard time with it, saw several consultants and had postpartum depression). Atleast this way my supply was established and I only recently have had to supplement with formula. Good luck and find lots of people who are supportive of breastfeeding to get you off to a good start.|`|8f87b5f3f42409172cc2b7ee984891a2aa	I'm breast feeding and it hurt me at the start, there were lots of different reasons, not being latched on properly, engorgement (a couple of savoy cabbage leaves in your bra really helps)! ,My baby is now 6 weeks old and sometimes now my nipples can get sore but i won't give up!... Just don't give up too early on, your midwife or health visitor are there for you i was constantly pestering them for breastfeeding advice, they will show you where you might be going wrong. remember it's best for you and your baby and it beats getting up and heating up a bottle in the night and also at night you can feed your baby lying on your side which s great... anyway don't give up. i understand that some women can't breastfeed but try at least a week it will hopefully get easier  GOOD LUCK xx
SaRDq9iLaa	The hospital I was at gave me a bag with a hairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, pads, those mesh underwear things, and socks.  I packed comfy pjs, slipper socks, a robe, my hairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, hair ties, a pillow, my ipod, a book of puzzles, clothes to leave in, baby clothes and socks to leave in, a hat for her, a blanket for her, and her car seat.  The hospital also let me take a bunch of diapers, soothies, and a few receiving blankets home with me.  Good luck to you!|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Here is my list     two pairs of comfypants/shirts  sweater   camera with plenty of batteries (or disposable)  shampoo/conditioner  toothbrush/paste  deoderant  make up   pads (incase you don't like the one the hospital gives you)  plenty of underwear (I take about 5 pairs of undies, the hospital does provide net underwear)  socks  pillow  chapstick (this is a must!)   things for your spouse (clothes and such)     for baby: a going home outfit, big blanket to go home in, carseat (the hospital provides diapers wipes, pacifiers, plenty of recieving blankets, caps,bottles/formula if you choose not to breastfeed.)|`|mc6YtaRbaa	http://www.squidoo.com/hospital-bag    http://www.cafemom.com/dailybuzz/pregnan...|`|W0gMQVoDaa	for you....  loads of knickers  a few pairs of pj's  slippers  dressing gown  sanitary towels  deodorant  sensitive wash  hairbrush  toothbrush and toothpaste  flannel or sponge    for baby......  nappies  wipes  cotton wool  baby lotion sometimes baby's are born with dry skin  a pack of vests  pack of sleep suits  dummies? pacifier?  hats  scratch mits  baby blanket   congratulations and good luck xx|`|hGqQIusSaa	I learned that you don't need as much as you think!  For the baby I brought an outfit for her to have her pictures taken in and to come home in, that was it! If you're breastfeeding you'll already have that with you, if you're formula feeding the hospital will supply you with some.    I needed:  camera!  Chapstick after labor, phew!  shampoo/conditioner along with my brush and dryer  crosswords/entertainment  comfy clothes to come home in.    That's it!    They supplied everything else for me.|`|F6jUJUoOaa	well firstly get your bag prepared nice and early dont do what i did, coz my son was born 3 days early and i just packed my bag the night before.    BABY:  Nappies  Baby Wipes  Cotton wool Balls  Baby Sleepsuit (I'd get about 3-4 of them coz newborn babies CAN do a wee whilst changing nappy or vomit)  Vests (again 3-4 of them)  Little hat  Little Gloves  Blanket (maybe even a jacket - if your having the baby sometime nowish)  Baby Powder  Baby Lotion   DEFINITELY a car seat- but obviously you dont need to bring that inside the hospital but whoevers picking you up from hospital will need to have that.    YOU:  Nightie  Knickers (get some old ones about 4-5 of them)  Slippers  Hairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, shampoo any other toiletries you may need etc  Strong Pads  Towel  Outdoor clothing (to go home in - DONT get your best jeans or skirt etc coz trust me you wont fit in to them straight away, just get some baggy clothes)  IMPORTANT - Get some open FLAT sandals to go home in coz trust me if you end up with swollen ankles you will not be able to wear your shoes i ended up goin homeinmy slippers lol.    If theres anything your unsure of the best person to ask would be your midwife, she can even give you a proper list of what you need. IF your baby has dry skin the best thing to use would be Olive oil - its great for newborn skin    Goodluck hun x|`|jkDawQVNaa	everything, bring your own pads, undies ,pj's, going home clothes for you and baby, lip gloss cause after giving birth your lips look like toasted bread! lol also carrie slippers and your favorite pillows, a few bucks just in case you need anything while you are there. enjoy!|`|AA10207874	Yhe hospital bag is mainly for you. The hospital has everything the baby needs except for their going home outfit. So pack things that will make you comfy and don't forget your camera.|`|pTBhq0rHaa	Take a few changes of clothes, (big and baggy), take a few night-shirts, those like really big T-shirts. Undergarments. Tooth-brush/tooth paste, soap/shampoo, socks, and whatever else you need to take that you need to keep clean. Hair brush, make-up. Pack all the things you would if you were going on a trip, except make it comfortable clothes.    And for the baby, make sure you pack 5-6 outfits for him/her, in case of accidents, or if you get the hospital pictures. The hospital will provide all formula/diapers/wipes etc. for the baby while your there.    and CONGRATULATIONS. What a blessing.|`|0437a9a5ca16bc09f111190dcbc55384aa	I had an entire suitcase of crap that baby center suggested I bring, and I didn't use really any of it... with my second... I know now what I will need... CHAPSTICK!!! slippers, bathrobe, pillow, pj's(or whatever you want to go home in) baby clothes for him/her to go home in, camera, (if you care, makeup, for when visitors come to see you.) batteries for the camera... and I think thats it... Good luck!|`|heqVgZhsaa	All of these answers are correct, depending on what country you are in and what hospital you are going to... Also how long you are planning on staying. I am in Australia and at book in for the hospital they tell you what you need. They supply the clothing (ugly little mini hospital gowns!) aswell as nappies whilst you are there. They also supply baby wash and lotions etc. I am taking a couple of cute outfits, for piccies aswell as some nice snuggle blankets to wrap her in for when family come... don't want the first impression to be hospital get-up! I also recommend that you take a bottle and formula incase the breastfeeding does not happen (I successfully breastfed 3 out of my 4 so far but the last one had a funny little mouth and could not attach!) Also I felt comfy in some nice satin pjs, so you don't feel like a total dag when you get visitors! Make sure they have buttons all the way for feeding. A little bit of makeup, lipgloss (for photos!) and breast pads and maternity pads. A few good maternity bras. A few magazines or a good book! Can get boring when bubs is asleep!

OY8Z5vG9aa	if the condom didn't rip or anything then you really don't have anything to worry about.  you could've just gotten your period 2 days after if:  -you've recently became sexually active  -old blood in your vagina either from a previous period or from the sex itself  -your periods may not be regular yet  -sometimes they just come early (or late) for no apparently reason    just relax.  you only have to worry if your period doesn't come next month.  in that case take a pregnancy test.  but don't stress cause stress can cause you to miss your period or for it to be late.|`|AR683Nz6aa	no, your having a period and the condom didnt spilt. common sense really|`|v3LnJycKaa	no it just means you started your period 2 days after having sex...

4a2b1a81a9c8031e2a999ddf51108881aa	Medela is generally considered the top of the line when it comes to anything breastfeeding.    The LCs at my hospital say they would never recommend a manual pump, only automatic.  I was told the manual pumps are...well, crap.  I have NO personal experience, though.  So keep that in mind! :-)    Also (at least in Massachusetts) most major insurance companies will cover the automatic pump.  You need to wait until you've given birth and have your doctor write out a script.|`|4YfehneDaa	The electric ones are sooo much better than a hand pump.  your hand will get very tired and it takes a lot longer.  The electric ones are more expensive but i don't think you need to buy a really expensive one.  it depends on how much you are pumping.  The best brand is Medela. they make all different pumps based on how much you will use it.  If you are going to be going back to work, you will probably want a double electric for faster pumping.  i stay at home so i have a Medela single electric for occasional use (around $75 i think)  you can pick up cheaper electric ones at the drug store or walmart.  ive heard other people say they like the Avent Isis.      One thing to remember however, is wait until you are sure you are going to continue breastfeeding before buying one.  you wont need it right after delivery so you'll have time to get one after.  YOu could also ask for one for a shower gift, just check with the store on the return policy where you register.  the store i got mine from lets you return it as long as the box isn't opened.  good luck!    Visit www.medela.com|`|F6lZHRkVaa	How much pumping do you plan to do? If you're going back to work and plan to pump there, an expensive electrical pump with a great system for milk storage would be your best bet. You can rent these from hospitals too so look into that.    If you plan to pump just to store milk on occasion, a manual one will do the trick. Some pumps you just plug in, squeeze the trigger a few times, and then it will pump on its own depending on the rhythm you used when you squeezed. My pump was like that and ran around $120.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Wait until you have the baby to decide what is right for your needs!    I have a Medela Pump N' Style!|`|AA11220327	with both of my older kids, I used the Avent manual pump, and it was great. very easy to use, and very easy to clean. Also very easy to find, it is carried at all major drug stores and department stores
vue9NOhYaa	There is no one 'right' weight or legnth.  The 'right' size is the size your baby is meant to be.    According to the standard growth charts, your baby is slightly above the 95th percentile. So he's a big boy, but that's fine.  As long as he's eating foods appropriate for his age (breastmilk or formula only -- no cereal or juice), and eating what he wants/when he wants it) he will gain as he is supposed to.     Many babies gain VERY fast during the first 4-6 months, and then slow down a lot later on.  So being big now doesn't mean he'll always be big.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Ryan was 14.9 lbs at around 3 months!  I dont believe there is a right or wrong weight|`|NroZQN5vaa	There is no "right'" weight and length for babies just like there isn't one for adults. When you take him to the doctor for a well baby check up, ask the doctor. They'll let you know since they know your baby's history.|`|s8SnVmXvaa	There is no right answer.  What they always told me is at that age, as long as they're gaining weight steadily and having regular poops that they're doing okay.  Some babies are just going to be smaller, others bigger.  So don't worry about it so much :)|`|qKnE08Rxaa	There's no right weight but you can find out where your baby compare to other babies. Check the chart from here.     http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/gro...
zIPLhbozaa	Wow, there are so many things that it will be good to have. You really need to get these things soon too because you will be pretty busy once you deliver, especially if you are expecting twins. Congrats!!      Things I got: Changing Table, Power Swing, crib, crib seats, bassinet, *Car Seat*, High Chair, clothes up to 6 month size, Can of formula in case breastfeeding ends up not working for you, receiving blankets, bibs, wash clothes, swaddle blankets, boppy pillow, baby monitor, pack n play, stroller, baby bath products, daipers, wipes, diaper genie, diaper rash cream.    I'm probably forgetting some things. But I hope this helps.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	First of all car seats, you can not leave the hospital without them. You will also need diapers, wipes, outfits, receiving blankets, socks, butt cream, bottles, formula(if you aren't Bfeeding), burp cloths, diaper bag, crib/bassinet, first aid kit, etc. It's a good idea to stock up your fridge and pantry too. If you go to whattoexpect.com, it will give you a very detailed list of all the muct-have items.|`|xeS8pUfbaa	car seats   diaper genie  hats and socks  2 seat stroller  formula  idk go to targets website and look in the baby section. they show you the basics i just registered on there|`|7EzmV1t8aa	Burp Cloths......you can never have enough burp cloths!  A boppy was heaven with my little one and the book Baby Wise, will make your life easier if you can follow it from the minute they are born.  It's a short read so go buy it now!
QXSFpMzDaa	Every baby is different.  It might be time to try pureed baby food.  My daughter never ate the store bought jarred food.  I usually pureed everything for her.  I think it is definitely time to start him on a breakfast, lunch, and dinner, of pureed whatever.  Enjoy it they are so much fun to feed at this age!!|`|f5yUbagpaa	At 6months I fed my daughter table food. So that might be something you would want to start to do. things like mashed potato's, grits, collard greens juice, that will get him full and give him a cute fat face.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Our son was like this! Starting around five months, he was eating softer table foods - and once he tasted them, he didn't exactly want to go on to junior jarred foods. At six months, he was eating full table food - pretty much everything we were - adapted, of course, for his age. He was six months his first Easter, and he ate everything at the holiday meal, including ham and sausage! And, he was happier and totally healthy for it all!. Also, went off formula, and on to homogenized milk.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Have you tried making your own food for him?  Steaming or boiling your own veggies and pureeing is really easy and much cheaper than baby food jars.|`|NroZQN5vaa	Our daughter was eating rice cereal, sweet potatoes, carrots, peas, green beans, bananas and apple sauce at 6 months, under a dr's recommendation.
oXzHvsBpaa	Yes that is enough. My son drank about 2.5 ounces every 2-3 hours. You know to start feeding more when the time in between feedsings is less then 2 hours. Thats how we did it anyway.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Is that what he wants?  Babies this age should be fed on demand -- as much as he wants, as often as he wants. If he's 'asking' every 3 hours, and taking 3 ounces, then that's right for him.      (I do have to ask -- is there any particular reason you are pumping?  While it's a great thing to do IF you have to [baby can't or wont' nurse for some reason], if it's just your choice, it's going to get VERY tiring over the next few months, and  you'd be better served to focus on getting baby onto the breast.  A nursing baby will always take just the right amount, so you dont' have to fret about ounces or schedules.)|`|wphLaVs6aa	That sounds about right. Your baby needs about 25 oz of milk every 24 hours. You can read some great info about this here:    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milkc...|`|ZdeJCdCbaa	as long as she is eating every 2-3 hrs...at least 2oz per feeding its good!|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Why are you using a bottle?  If you want breastfeeding to work and your supply to keep up you need to nurse your baby directly.  Pumping exclusively will not keep up your supply.  Generally a 2 week old baby will eat much more frequently than every three hours.  My 10 month old breastfed baby eats every 2 hours or so during the day.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Does he/she cry after feeding or act like they want more? If not then yes your baby is getting enough. If the baby is being fussy after a feeding then no he/she is probably not getting enough.    People take a chill pill. Its none of your Business why she isn't breastfeeding. The baby is getting breast milk so whats it matter. Answer the question instead of preaching about how she should be breastfeeding, its not your child or your concern.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	yes  my daughter only had  2 oz every 3 hours untill she was 2 months.    shes 4  months now and has 3 oz every 2 hrs
1z3C0R2Vaa	no because i know of athletes that got pregnant theirs first trying .|`|X5TNlI3Raa	i was an athlete until i was 25 got married and got pregnant [i played college cheerleading and basketball] i had no trouble getting pregnant it took me about 2 months of trying to get pregnant.. now look at me!  i have 3 beautiful children and twins on the way.|`|Mx2hzWgTaa	i was an athlete until i was 25 got married and got pregnant [i played college soccer] i had no trouble getting pregnant it took me about 3 months of trying to get pregnant.. now look at me! i have 4 beautiful kids and twins on the way!|`|PGeAFKYZaa	Nothing unusual as long diet and exercise are devoid of drugs, hormones etc., etc.|`|JWEZ4PMKaa	some would say that it is harder because if you are highly athletic then chances are that you have a very low body fat percentage, which makes it harder for a fertilized egg to become nourished enough in the uterus to where it will either not implant on the uterine lining or it will end in a miscarriage due to the fact that there is not enough fatty lining and nourishment in the womb.|`|NhzrO6NKaa	Baby Names at babynames.visitthebest.com | Baby Boy Names | Baby Girl Names | Top Most Popular Names|World's Largest Database Of Baby Names|baby fun videos on http://www.babynames.visitthebest.com/
WlU3NFu6aa	abstinence|`|zSABr7praa	Abstinence eliminates the possibility.  But birth control AND condoms together are very effective.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Abstinence  Its the only way to "be sure" of not getting pregnant|`|H74F8jxuaa	I agree with the previous answerers.  The only sure fire way is abstinence.  No contraceptive is 100% effective.  People get pregnant off bc all the time and condoms break (one broke on me).|`|AA10908541	yea you can never be too sure about it.. i mean a few of them say 99.9% accurate but you can't be positive. My boyfriend and I got pregnant easily and really quickly, we were going to get on the Depo shot (which worked for me for 2 years a few years ago) and we stopped using condoms for a week.. the dr. told me he wouldnt give me the shot until I got my cycle going and I was supposed to get it any day and it never came. It only took a week! So if you cant handle a baby right now, be very careful.|`|P37lIBr2aa	it's true that only abstinence is the only SURE way to not get pregnant. I'm sure if you google it though it will tell you the effectivness of each kind. If i remember right condoms are about 75% effective and the mirena IUD is 97% effective. There are many options but different bodies take it into their systems differently so be extra careful while you're ovulating!
qStmw7qgaa	You'll have to deal with a cranky baby for a while.  My daughter was the same way at first.  Just keep her up as long as you can during the day...make sure she gets lots of stimulation.  And then she will want to sleep at night.  It make take a week...it may only take a few days...but eventually her time clock will switch.|`|PuJd9SNlaa	You are going to have to try to keep her awake during the day.  Keep the house noisy, play with her a lot.  It will be rough for a couple of days, but once you get her switched back...sweet dreams for both of you!
dbafItLvaa	First, say a prayer.  Second, find out for sure if she's pregnant.  Lots of things could cause her period to be late.  Have her take the test, then if it is positive, approach this like a man.  Sit down with her dad and be honest.  Express to him everything that you did in your question. These things happen, and life will go on.  The most important thing is this little life that you may have created.  Keep that as your focus and you might be surprised that you live through this and are stronger for it!  Good luck.|`|nXrAkx8Iaa	best thing to do is support is to be there with her every step of the way go to her doc. visits so you both can talk about her depression together because if she had it before she is most likely to have it again while pregnant and also it makes a world of difference having a loving caring boyfriend around.....oh and just a little fyi mood swings are HORRIBLE so when she yells at you dont get offended it will all be over soon: )|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Just be there for her and tell her dad straight out that you got her pregnant but that you are going to be there for her whether he likes it or not. Promise him that you will help take care of that child and love it no matter what.|`|DpQPsTVfaa	omg baby sit so you can start making money and baby practice :)|`|jiSbR2w7aa	Wait to find out what the pregnancy test says.. if it says positive then.. well, just be supportive and always be there for her no matter what, make sure she doesn't try to get an abortion or anything.. You sound like you want to keep the baby, but maybe you should discuss with your girlfriend about giving the baby up for adoption. Do whatever you think is best. Good luck.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	the sister cant take the baby because then you can call the police because it is your child.. did the test say positive? tell her dad and be supportive.. good luck :).. if ya need to talk then just shoot me an email|`|0VFKldieaa	just support her and her sister can't take the baby away from you guys. that is illegal its called kidnapping. you will probably need help with the baby being so young and probably not having jobs so don't be afraid to ask your family and her dad for help. i wish you the best.|`|1qnbvUYPaa	All I can say is maybe it's not the best idea to bring a baby into your lives because they seem pretty broken..it's not fair to the baby nor for you guys. You are VERY young. I'm 20 and 29 weeks with my first baby. My fiance is 22 and his parents were very upset when they found out, and he's an adult. I'd think twice before commiting yourself because this is a life long choice. Good Luck and don't let anyone talk you out of early fetal abortion.|`|lqSMkDNkaa	Oh honey :(  Well be rest assured that you have legal rights to that baby as a father.  No one can keep the baby away from you.  When the baby is born go down to the court house and file for a paternity test.  Once it is proven through that test that you are the father you will have custody so long as you are a fit parent for the baby and aren't into anything illegas like drugs or crime.  Good luck sweet pea!  Wish there were more dads out there like you who have love to give to their children.|`|ff32225b284101d05a2982908b6b5febaa	If you actually love her and want to have the baby you guys could be emancipated and you would both need to work and take care of your kid, Work opposite shifts so you don't ahve to hire a sitter (if she even can at her age tho). It's VERY hard to be a parent...so...you may want to consider other options ...adoption. Especially if you both have really screwed up lives. It's so easy to mess up a kid if you bring them in a toxic environment. A true parent does whats best for their baby. IF that means her sister..so be it.|`|AA10908541	You need to use protection and try to prevent this from happening if it hasnt happened already. And if it has, it isnt the end of the world, its entirely possible to take care of it and the other person is right, she cant take your baby away from you guys. It will be hard, but you can get help and you can make it through this. And I am SOOOO happy that you're so supportive of your girlfriend. That is beautiful to me. But periods are also missed from being stressed out, and if shes been stressed out she could have missed it from that as well. Go to a doctor and see for sure. good luck.|`|xMy0QEvFaa	is she pregnant or not? Explain?  If she is pregnant you NEED to talk to your parents and her dad.  And if she's not pregnant she needs to get on birth control or you guys need to stop having sex.    That's great your going to be supportive, but how are you going to buy her maternity clothes, what shes craving, baby clothes, diapers, formula, bottles, binkies, toys, a car seat, a crib, bouncers, diaper bags and that's only half of what the baby needs.    What does being a semi-pro paintballer have to do with raising a kid?  You are not ready for the responsibility of a baby.
eya1WDS4aa	Its normal. I had a c section as well. Its harder to get back down to size when you had a c section. It took me 9 months and the only reason i lost the rest of the weight was because i had the stomach flu. Dont worrie to much. Trust me if your baby is 8 months old you will be dropping the weight in no time.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Exercise.  8 months postpartum, your uterus is back to normal size.  What you have is belly fat.
9OsjdsrZaa	Good Question.  It is never easy to know how many bottles our little ones need.  Your best rule of thumb is to let him tell you when he has enough, or when he needs more.  A babies appetite never stays the same.  At times they want more, at other times less.  They go through a lot of growth spurts, which can cause them to eat(drink) a lot more than usual.      Your 2 solids a day are good.  If he wants more, that is fine as well.  Solids help keep their tummies satisfied.  Sometimes, they may just refuse them all together.  All 3 of my children went through stages where they just wanted to nurse and refused all solids.  Your best bet is to let him tell you in his own little way what he wants and or needs.    Good Luck!  It is never easy trying to figure out what is best for our babies...all we have sometimes is our instinct.  So don't doubt yours and jump in with both feet!|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Don't take any.  He still needs lots of milk even though he's eating solids.|`|vue9NOhYaa	At 6 months his milk is still the great bulk of his diet. Solids are just for fun. There's no rule as to how much formula he 'should' be getting -- but a minimum of 24 ounces, and a maximum of around 40-45.      If he's having 5 bottles, that sounds pretty sensible to me.  There's no reason to cut one out.  Continue to offer his usual bottles, and offer solids after 2 of those solid meals.  That way you can be sure he's getting all the nutrients he needs (from his milk), and the fun of learning to eat solids.|`|I3CNklLKaa	I'd worry more about his education than "taking bottles of him" (whatever that means) if I were you.|`|u1ap1Ni2aa	I would leave him with the 5 bottles he will let you know when he is ready for less milk, by not drinking one of the bottles when fed, By giving him one less now you are running the risk of him getting up more frequent in the night and no-one likes getting up for those night feeds!|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Food shouldn't replace any milk feeds, starting solids should be in addition to all usual milk feeds, this is where babies are supposed to get the majority of their nutrition from.  What makes you want to cut down his milk?

pnL5WTXMaa	no that should not happen. if so go to doctor and have it checked out.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	the most common reason for leaking breasts when not breast feeding is a pituitary gland tumor.    Thumbs down huh?|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Cuz thats where the milk glands are lol. really though     It can happen if she receives medicine for it or if another woman takes the place of a mother by letting the baby latch on (not sure how long). Its called Induced Lactation. But usually no a woman won't just leak milk unless something is wrong.     "...In the event that no already-nursing mother was available, anthropological reports from several continents describe efforts by non-lactating woman to induce lactation by putting the baby to breast..."
dbafItLvaa	Well I believe you could, but if you are on medication for it, be sure it is not harmful to a fetus.  You will want to see a doctor whether or not you are currently under treatment for it, and tell him/her you are trying to get pregnant. Hopefully they can treat you with something that will not be harmful to a developing baby.  Good luck!
AA11503678	I am not expert but I have bought an electronic device for my nephew's baby that is capable of identifying the reasons why a baby is crying. If you solve your baby's problem it feels good and sleeps better imho.    http://www.showeryourbaby.com/whycrbacra...|`|qdLdcR8Maa	you could start feeding him food now maybe at 5 months! my hv told me not to untill he was 6 months but i knew my son was hungry so i gave him food and he loved it and he slept well anyway but he sleeps more now (although wev had a few rough nights!) but he eats 3 meals a day now with snacks and juice and 1bottle of 6oz milk in morning and one at night for bed! he is now 9 months old and has ben eating food since 5 months and hes perfectly fine.     Only a mother knows the child best and if you are having problems with him waking up at night maybe hes just not full!    If its the rolling over cant you buy one of those long pillows and put it by his bk so he cant roll over and wake up!|`|AA10976444	Give him a tablespoon of rice cereal at bedtime...it will help fill him up.

He was strictly breastfed also.|`|hqogf9oGaa	I would suggest trying a "sleep positioner"    Here's a link to one I found through a google search.    http://www.cleverlittlethings.co.uk/Prod...

But my daughter was 11 months and still woke up 2 to 3 times a night. I finally let her cry back to sleep for a couple nights and now she will sleep from 8pm to 5am. I believe they wake up because they get in the habit of eating every few hours.|`|q3nK221eaa	this has just happened to me. my son is now 6 months and on 3 little meals a day plus 3 bottles and on the day he ate 3 meals he slept for 12 houyrs and has done since. maybe breast milk alone is not satisfying him enough anymore which is perfectly normal.

Nonetheless I use 7th generation because it doesn't have chlorine, bleach, dyes or perfumes. It's great and it's good for the environment.|`|FRwxXGynaa	Anything that says "free and clear". I am using the Purex kind right now and it works great!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Honestly?  Baby laundry soap is a big scam.  Just use the regular stuff.

I love the polka dot idea, very cute.    I'd really try to find polka dots that are a little bit more on the pastel side... the lavendar is so soft and the dots are pretty bright.  Or you could always for the bright dots and find a comforter to go with it.      http://www.rosenberryrooms.com/219-dotti...  Something like this would go fabulously with her bedding!

But I don't think they'll match the color of the set.  I didn't notice if you could get different colors, but the ones they use in the room on the ad are to bold for the purple of the set.  If you could work with the colors, and make them match better, then it would be really cute!    ADD*  I just don't think the lavender's gonna go, even if you do add more.  It's just not in the right color group, or even a good contrast.  The purple is pretty, it's just not right!  I think if you can afford it the best thing would be to get a new set!|`|IkkYOehSaa	that's awesome!!!!! and she is sooooo precious.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Super Cute!

BILIAKSOaa	I would say going to bed around 9 p.m. Don't eat any type of junk food four hours before you go to bed. If your thirsty drink water. Try reading a book before bed and try not to be too stressed. When I'm stressed I can't stop thinking about things. It takes me like 45 minutes to fall asleep. Also, keep your room dark and not full of light. Light makes me stay awake longer.  Hope I helped. (:|`|f7qVtYfaaa	try doing a light workout in the early evening, it will pump you up a bit and then you won't need to nap.|`|dkYuUl5oaa	I don't get it|`|VWO9tW5eaa	read a book before you go to bed, dont watch tv and dont eat after 8|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	OK, there are several possibilities.    First, you could be anemic, or have an underactive thyroid.  Both of these can disrupt sleep patterns.  See a doctor just to make sure.    Second, you may be getting too much sleep!  You say you don't go to bed late.  So how early do you go to bed?  Recent studies indicate most teenagers need 9 hours of sleep.  If you're getting more than that, you are disrupting your own sleep patterns.  Try to cut out the afternoon snooze, and go to be 9 hours before 6:00 a.m.    Third, you might not be getting enough exercise.  Try upping your physical activity and see if that gives you more energy.    Fourth, you might be eating things that actually make you drowsy.  Foods with high levels of tryptophan will actually make you feel sleepy.  Milk, corn, brown rice, legumes and turkey all have high levels of this substance.  Sugars and high fat foods will also slow you down, contrary to the popular opinion that sugar energizes you.    Change your habits, buy a nightlight, and sleep well!    Good luck!|`|33h5R8nTaa	ok first off this new born and babys.... but i had this problem actually after adjucting to my daughters birth and normal up all night feedings. i took melatonin 3 mg and i feel asleep and stayed asleep  and i did that for maybe 2 weeks and then stoped taking it and now i fall asleep just fine.

If you're not experienceing a whole lot of stress, it's most likely just your body asking for a little attention. Make sure you eat healthy food, not too much junk food or fast food. Drink LOTS of water. You may also be dehydrated.    A warm shower before bed usually helps. Sleep with light clothing. And don't eat a heavy meal right before bed.    H20: When someone talks about dehydration, it doesn't mean that you have to be gasping for air or feeling awful to be dehydrated. In fact, even feeling a little thirsty already means your body is lacking water.  Instead of drinking soda or juices, drink water.    NAPPING: Your mom has a point too. Usually sleeping too long in the afternoon keeps you up 'til late. But this doesn't necessarily mean that you won't sleep well if you napped earlier.    Oh, btw, when you wake up in the middle of the night, try not to stay up and do things, like going to the computer or fiddling with your phone, or switching the light on 'cause it's dark ;)    Because as soon as you do this, your brain will know that at this time, you have to be active and it will turn into a habit. So stay in bed.    Try switching sides. Let's say you sleep with your head towards the headboard, try the othery way.    Sometimes, it's a matter of making it a habit. You have to tell your body that it's time to shut off and rest. Otherwise, you'll be up in the wee hours of the morning and you'll feel tired during the day. I know how that feels.    I hope this helps. Good luck!
LMkj8D8eaa	Holy Moley!...         Well, you know what they say... never ever start a baby out in your bed... but.. i'm not here to lecture you!!!! i'm here to helP! :-)    maybe you could start it out slowly... put her crib in your room, let her sleep in there.. play with her in her room daily, so she is familiar with the room, and then after she sleeps in the crib for a few nights in your room, move it on over to hers.. make sure you have a night light, so she can see a little bit    good luck.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	My son is almost 20 months, and he sleeps in his crib, and never slept in my bed, but I still had trouble getting him to learn to fall asleep on his own! My doctor told me that it's perfectly fine to let them cry themselves to sleep for up to about 20 minutes, as long as you're positive there's nothing else wrong, like they are sick, hungry, wet, etc. He's doing a lot better, but for a while I had trouble with him waking up a few times a night SCREAMING. Like something was terribly wrong with him. One of the books I had told me that it was a very common sign of teething, especially with their molars, which is the teeth he was getting at the time. So Tylenol and Motrin helped us through that patch, and now he's fine again. Hope this helped a little!|`|c0c40778eea0e912057682e422a03b41aa	The person who says put a tv in her room, well, I really agree with her. If I had a child, I think I would be heartbroken to make them cry themselves to sleep, but putting a tv there may take her attention away. Also, another person said do it slowly, like let her be comfortable and everything. I think you should use both ways, because I really think making your child cry herself to sleep is heartbreaking.|`|EI1NT6NSaa	I had the same problem with my little girl.  I put my daughters cot next to my bed, i put her in it, tucked her in and laid on my bed next to hers, holding her hand through the bars.  Having her cot next to your bed makes her feel close to you and that's what she likes about sleeping in your bed.  The first few night i did this i stayed there,holding her hand, till she went to sleep, she cried for about half an hour but this was alot less then normal.  The following week i stayed just till she was sleepy then left the room, she cried for about 10 mins.  Over the next few weeks i gradually decreased the time i laid beside her and now she sleeps on her own.  It will take time if she been with you for that long so just be patient with her.    Also it helps to have something in her cot/bed that she recognises is a bed time thing. My little girl has a lullaby sheep that plays music. i play it every time she goes to bed so now she knows when it plays its time for bed.    i still enjoy cuddles with my princess in bed but now i do it in the morning so she doesn't fell left out.    hope this helps|`|wHVx9HZVaa	I co-slept with both of mine.  We started the process of getting them out because they just got too big and fidgeted too much. Sex was not a problem as that just took place at other times of the day! Why wait until bed time?  Anyway, start with her bed next to yours and make a point of congratulating her for getting in it. Make a big fuss about it. How wonderful it is for her to have her own bed, how she is big enough for her own bed. Introduce a snuggle partner, a soft toy that will always be with her in bed.  Once she is two she should be able to understand that being in her own room is a good thing and a sign of growing up. Both of ours would sneak into our bed in the night at first but eventually they settled in their own and just came in for a cuddle in the morning.|`|JYOfGBwqaa	I think it is wrong to let her get used to sleeping in your bed & then all of a sudden expect her to soothe herself to sleep alone. I personally dont agree with letting a baby cry it out. She is too young to understand why you wont let her sleep in her bed.    Get this book its called The No cry Sleep solution.     Good luck|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	We put a tv in my daughters room in order to get her to sleep in her own room and bed. Me and my husband wouldn't go to bed till she fell asleep. After she got comfortable being in her room by herself we cut off on the tv and now she sleeps in her bed without a problem.|`|UZKg2odzaa	You just gotta put her in there and let her cry. If you don't do it now then it will never happen. And you can't risk hurting your marriage. You must find a way to make her stay in her own bed and do not listen to her when she cries.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	not too late. never too late.. just start making her do it and she'll eventually be on her own. thats how old our son was when we switched him to his own bed.    when you put her in her own bed, stay with her for the first few nights. and then slowly go out of the room. she is way to old (in my opinion) for the cry it out method.|`|EeGgovyCaa	I'm totally in the same boat, trying to break my DD of co-sleeping. But she wakes up instantly when I put her in her crib or pack n play. We can't do the CIO because she wakes her brother up, then I have two crying babies at 1 am, plus I have neighbors.     we have a white noise machine that seems to help. So far she's gone four straight hours in her crib. Baby steps I guess, this will be a tough one to break. Good luck|`|33h5R8nTaa	honestly you just have to let her cry it out. your not going to sleep the first few nights but it will get better as time goes on...Tonight tell her she is going to sleep in her big girl bed tonght and give her a exciting tour of her room and tell her all the great things in it and finish with the crib and then place her in it and say something like my what a big girl in her own bed. Then say its night night time. let her cry it out till she falls asleeo=p and then if she wakes up just keep letting her cry all night maybe go in once or twice and telling her its ok your fine.|`|0VHolTVEaa	No its not too late. What you should do is move her bed or cot next to you so she feels at ease your near by. Slowly she will get used to sleeping on her own then you can move it in her own room. Just take one day at a time and if she cries let her at first then she will finally calm down.

Thus, my son got a good helping of the works of Brahms (specifically, his German Requiem) and a lot of madrigals (fun pieces from the Renaissance), thanks to those rehearsals.  He also heard a lot of Aerosmith, Tom Waits, and The Doors.    Edit:  Kind of a funny story.  I took my son up to school when he was a week old, so I could show him off to my friends and professors in the music department.

S8a0wC9iaa	I would ask your midwife/health visitor for advice. I wouldn't go trying any foods/drinks except milk/boiled water unless under the advice of a health professional as she is very young. What is okay for someone elses baby may not be okay for yours.|`|33h5R8nTaa	give her diluted prune juice lust 1/2 oz water and 1/2 oz juice. room temp so it goes through faster. she should be pooping soon.|`|0VHolTVEaa	You can give her cooled boiled water as this will help clear her system. Also try gripe water as this helps gas. When i had mine i used 2 home remedies which helped mine, one was rub a small amount of oil around your babies belly button and use a finger to gently go around that should remove the gas, also turn baby on her stomach and gently massage her back. Secondly i added a little brown sugar to his milk as this relieves gas and really helped him. Hope my advice works|`|hXoUFWL1aa	Same thing happened to my baby boy. My doctor had me give him 1 oz of baby apple juice with 1 oz of purified water. He has been great ever since.|`|ubf26k2Oaa	I wouldnt give a baby this young any kind of laxative.  You dont say if you are breastfeeding, but if you are, its quite common for a baby to only do a poo once a week...the breastmilk is so perfect, nutrient-wise, that there isnt a lot of waste produced.  I wouldnt worry about it too much, unless she seems distressed or in discomfort, then take her to the doctor.|`|Lzt1eIZFaa	My daughter had this problem and it was heartbreaking seeing her in pain.  I think my daughter was about a month old.      I rang the midwife and was told to boil water and let it cool a bit, it needs to be warm.  Then she told me to lie my daughter down on her changing mat and lift her legs up, holding on with one hand, leaving her knees bent back,  (it looks uncomfortable, but babies are flexible) then cover her anus with vaseline.    Then I was told to dip a cotton wool ball into the water and squeeze the water out onto her anus.  Then wipe with the cotton wool and repeat again with a clean cotton wool ball.  I was told to carry on doing this along with pushing her legs back.  She then started to push her legs against my hand, I kept a firm grip (not too firm of course) and kept pushing her legs back and she pooed. Bear in mind you have to keep a bit of pressure on the legs.    Don't get me wrong it was hard to see her trying to strain but it did work and it's better to get the poo out than let it fester in her body, that is more damaging.    Another thing the midwife said was, put a bit of brown sugar in cooled boiled water, and let her drink it.  I was quite dubious about that one but  you'll try anything when you see your baby in pain and she was a midwife.    Hope she goes for you soon.|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	After this many days, if she still can't "do", give her an infant-size glycerine suppository - or, if desperate, put a sliver of plain soap up her butthole (with vaseline).  Either one should help her do a smelly in under 20 minutes.|`|LMkj8D8eaa	awe man i used to hate when this happened to my son.    do not let the doctor give her a suppository, you'll bawl your eyes out.. it'll make her poop when she doesn't have anything to poop out, and it'll hurt!...      mix a teaspoon of prune juice in with her formula. Adult Prune Juice, not the infant stuff.    or..... LIGHT Karo Syrup, mix a teaspoon of that in.. and do not listen to what they say about botulism with that.. .you're giving her such a small dose, it isn't even going to affect nothing.      but anyway, thats what we did with my son, and a bit later... he pooed, and hasn't stopped since! lol|`|XflZjhaXaa	She might be a little too young for juice. If she's breastfed there's no need to worry unless it's been 5 days and/or you see her straining.     Here's a tip if she isn't breastfed.... When my son was constipated the nurse said to put vaseline on the end of a thermometer and insert it in his bum. I know it sounds uncomfortable but it stimulates the anal glands making it easier for him to go.|`|PPbC3RJYaa	The advice i recieved when my daughter was constipated (she was 8 weeks,now 16 weeks) was brown sugar in boiling water then cooled (obviously!!) Did the trick with in a couple of hours!! and now anytime i feel shes straining i add the sugar to her water an have had results everytime?  hope this helps!|`|4mamQ68Daa	My baby was constipated at that age and we found it was the formula he was on. Powdered formula blocks up babies but ready made formula has a mild laxative in it. We changed to that and it worked. SMA blocked my little boy but Aptamil ready made worked wonders. Good luck
5Xz6lcGOaa	alot of babies get this, i could be either from dribbling if she is teething  or could also be from her milk..my son used 2 havev this and it was nothing to worry about, but if u are concerned just take her 2 ur GP and they can tell u excatly what it is   :)|`|hqogf9oGaa	It could be teething related but it could also be a yeast imbalance - babies can get this from milk.      Take her to the doctor just to be on the safe side.    Good luck!    Indigo    xxx|`|sw2R5A9iaa	it's most likely caused by the drool & slobber -put a nice coating of aquaphor on her mouth.  pat dry the mouth area periodically.|`|NQQaoG8Oaa	if she has a dummy it could be that, usually when they have a dummy and they are teething and dribble quite a lot this rash appears. try putting vaseline on to stop any more saliva making it worse|`|ubf26k2Oaa	If she is dribbling a lot, because of the teething, that could be causing the rash.  Try keeping an absorbent bib on her and dabbing (not rubbing) the dribble up regularly to keep her skin dry.|`|d55f9fa303ffed7693f24381e6799502aa	Take her to the doctor, she might need antibiotics, it could also be Thrush|`|758cDKEFaa	my 16 month old has the same thing.  ive been putting vaseline on it for the past week and its done nothing.  tomorrow im booking a doctors appointment it hopes they will give me some special cream to clear it up.
3NyM1cq5aa	Have you been giving her Baby Tylenol?  That may help her feel better.  Ask your doctor for the proper dosage.  It is normal for them to sleep more than usual after their shots, and they can feel pretty crummy for a couple of days too.  I know it's hard to watch, but she should be her usual self soon!|`|GDobAMQ8aa	Did the doctor give you or tell you to get infant tylenol?  If you have it, make sure you're giving it to her as directed; it really helps with fever and if she's feeling icky.|`|jYPeis3Saa	she probably isnt feeling too good from the shots.  its normal.    if she is running a fever try some infant tylenol|`|ZKVIW4Apaa	My daughter goes for her check up tomorrow, i was told to give her tempera before by the MD a half hour ahead of time and to give her another dose a half hour after, to reduce the chance of fever, as well a temped bath. He did say they will sleep alot after the needles...Poor things i feel horrible.. :(
