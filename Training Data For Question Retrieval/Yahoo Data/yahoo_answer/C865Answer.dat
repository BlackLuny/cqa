Bw1h5xAcaa	It's different in all areas of the country. Some places are experiencing layoffs and others are still in a big shortage.     Generally speaking nursing is still a very stable career choice. There WILL be an increase to the shortage as the older nurses retire (fewer new nurses are coming into the profession than there are old ones retiring and leaving the profession). You also have to consider our nation's population and the state of health. . . with an increasing Baby Boomer population comes an increased burden on the healthcare system. A nation of obsese people brings an increase in heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions.     I would say stick with it. People that are having trouble finding jobs are probably too picky and holding out for their ideal job. You might have to work for awhile in a nursing home or doing home health or something that wasn't your first choice, just to get some experience to get started. The economy will improve (although it might get worse before it gets better), and you WILL have a job.|`|UnlqJgXIaa	There will be a shortage of nurse --we are already serious shortage  of nurses here     As the baby boomers retire in large numbers there will be more of a demand than can be met   --The "Silver Tsunami" is only two to three years away|`|VR0h4L32aa	if you have the passion for it, just do it, there is always need for nurses because old nurses retire, some burn outs, etc etc.|`|VOccyg7daa	No, absolutely not. The government estimates that the US will be short 500,000 nurses by the year 2020. There is a pretty high rate of burnout in nursing and there are always nurses retiring. It's a safe bet that nurses will be in demand for years to come.|`|JiUwpYSXaa	I don't think so due to the aging baby boomers,  They are living into their 70s and 80s.  With that increase, there will be a more demand for geriatric care at hospitals, nursing homes, home health care.  These are places where the demand for nurses is going to increase.
X8iNQRnYaa	redit repair workd fine to fix my credit. They disputed and removed lots of bad items from my credit report. I used this service - creditreport.imess.net|`|qBCGH52haa	You can purchase your credit score from the credit bureaus (only your credit history is free, the scores cost money).    The "good" score varies somewhat among the bureaus because they have different methodologies, and different lenders and observers have different criteria for good, but figure level good is about 650.    Improve by paying on time consistently over time.  Also, more time on one job helps, increase the available credit ratio (defined as the amount of credit card debt divided by the total limits on the cards), decrease your debt to income ratio (pay off some debts).|`|gOyLBe1laa	well here is a link to how lenders see you base on your score, scroll to the bottom of the page when there so you can see. http://www.myfico.com/products/ficoone/s...

As soon as you buy something with credit, pay back the credit immediately. Pay all of your loan payments on time. That's all.|`|GMWJgn2Iaa	You sound like you are on right path with payments.  To get score up,    contact student loan company about sending bill to wrong address to see if they would remove from history    Don't move - frequent moves are not good.  Owning versus renting gets more pts, but you are a ways from that.    Unfortunately, to get credit score up, you need a credit card (get one with low credit limit $2000 or less) and make payments. Get one with a benefit (airline miles or other pts) and use it for groceries or gas only and pay off completely every month.  This will also take time as average age of credit is used in score, so the card you get should be one you plan to keep forever (Continental miles, United miles, Capital One pts,...).    Keep paying off student loans on time.    Good luck|`|Vmim6dv0aa	First make sure you pay your loans on time, at least the minimum.  You should take out a credit card and just put a small amount on it, no more then 30% of what your limit is.  You can use it for groceries or things you need, pay it each month on time.  The things they look at on your credit is delinquent accounts, late payments, how close you are to your credit limit on cards and how long you have been paying on things.  Your best bet is to first see your credit report to know exactly what is going on, then go from there.
G3P5htn7aa	If you mean your 2008 tax refund then.....  The Treasury won't send out separate economic stimulus payments for 2009. Instead, those eligible will claim the rebate credit on their 2008 returns. Credits generally increase the amount of a refund or reduce the amount of taxes owed.
0u6qy9Uuaa	try and get a high deductible plan ($1000) to protect yourself - even one trip to the emergency room can cost you $1000's - the monthly premium will still probably be $250-300/mo - it will be more expensive than a group plan because of the risk|`|y2ZukikXaa	There is no rule of thumb for that.

And if you banked it Saturday, it takes three working days to clear, so wouldn't expect it to reflect in your account until tomorrow.     Double check your balance - have you spent anything recently that isn't showing, but could account for your balance being out?     Failing that, give it 24hrs and then re-check your account.

3ME7sBxjaa	Definately not payday centers.  Because their loans are for such short terms, their rates can be around 100% apr.  Credit card company is about your only choice if you don't have something to provide as security.  And since it is only $200 you wouldn't want to tie a house or a car to it anyway.  Just be careful, credit card debt is a bad road to go down.|`|16vMIGPiaa	$200 can be saved up in a short time by eliminating smokes/beer/burgers.  Seriously!    And, yes, a credit card could float this amount for a month.  But you'll want to pay it off right away because the interest that CCs charge is high.  If you don't have the money now, you won't have it at the end of the month, so a CC is probably not a good idea.    DO NOT use payday or online anything!!  These people are either outright thieves or at very best they do not operate by the Truth In Lending laws.  That means you will get stuck with fees and interest that has you paying back two or three times what you borrowed, and not know it until the bill comes in.
16vMIGPiaa	The problem here is you let guilt and obligation get in the way and you signed a legal contract chaining you to an insane loan.  What can you do now?  Read your mortgage contract carefully.  As much money as you have lost, you will probably be better off to refinance NOW and get away from the insane payments.  Remember - all you have to pay off is the outstanding principal.  Hopefully you're not 'upside down'.  And if you've been really misled, you can get the Better Business Bureau involved; and possible the consumer advocacy people at the DA's office.
e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	I doubt you can afford the coverage.  Seriously.     Those types of policies START at $10,000 a year.  What you do with your hands, is like typeing - it's not exactly the same, as a violin virutosom, whose ONLY skill is playing the violin - or  a hand model, who makes $250,000 a year.      If you came to me, I'd get you the quote, but I'd CHARGE you a brokers fee - which would be refunded, IF you bought the policy from me.  The fee would cover my cost, and time, in getting the quote.  This type of coverage is HARD to place, and I don't think you'd end up buying it in the long run.    You would probably be better off, buying an accidental death and dismemberment policy.  Yep, they're generally a ripoff - because you're not very likely to ever cash it in - and it won't cover something like Carpel Tunnel (which, btw, would be covered under your WORKERS COMP coverage through your employer).  But it would be a heck of a lot cheaper than $10,000 a year.  Even a short and long term disabiltiy policy, would likely do better by you - but you'd need an agent to explain the difference, and the shortcomings, of both those policies - AND compare it to the "goal" of what you'd want them to ACHEIVE.|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	This is very common.

You will now owe less.|`|XR03jIndaa	yes, they will take it to help satisfy your tax debt|`|XbIoIUclaa	Until the tax debt is paid they will keep any tax refund you are entitled to. Last year they even kept my $1200 stimulus payment.|`|2nEBgHBEaa	I agree, even if you are on a payment plan they can still take your money to put toward the debt, if there is any money left over you will get that after the debt is paid in full that is. sorry I know it sucks!
qBCGH52haa	That would be correct, but the entire $800 billion does not go directly to job creation.  The goal of the entire thing is to solidify the financial portion of the economy, rebuild the infrastructure, create jobs, and alleviate certain other negative impacts of the current recession.    For example, if the auto companies got $20 billion, they could possibly save a few hundred thousand jobs.  This would not show up in the "job creation" category.  Similarly, pumping a few hundred billion into tax credits for businesses would probably allow many businesses to compete better, saving but maybe not creating jobs.    So, in this case, you just cannot divide the size of the stimulus bill by the estimated jobs created to get a "dollars for every job created" number.|`|wcDy86xuaa	the money isn't used for salary. it's used to provide the infrastructure to facilitate those new jobs.

b0d24bddcaaa43ed3a96f65bad4ed681aa	Hi,You can claim as many exemptions as you want. It`s like putting money in a Bank but not getting any interest back. You are putting your self in a higher tax bracket to get  a larger return at end of year. Good Luck|`|AA11284831	OK, lets clear up some terminology first.    A tax return is the papers you file with the IRS.  Form 1040, 1040-A, 1040-EZ, etc.  If you get money back after you file your tax return, that's called a REFUND.    You claim exemptions on your tax return.  You are entitled to one personal exemption only.    You claim withholding allowances on Form W-4 at your job.  That tells them how much tax to withhold from your pay.  The more allowances you claim, the less tax will be withheld.    In your case you could probably safely claim 2 withholding allowances.  You'd just about break even at filing time though there's a chance that you'd have a small bill to pay.  That should be less than $100 though.  If you want to be SURE that you don't have to pay next year, hold off until June and then make the change to 2.  That should net you a refund of about $250 or so next year.|`|dm6K4xRGaa	If you have less taken out because of changing to 2 exemptions you  will get less back on your return normally. It also depends on the amount you make and the new tax breaks  the IRS is now giving. If you make the same amount last year as the year before,and the IRS didnt chane the income brackets you would definitely get less back on your return. The amount you can make to receive the same return changed this year, so it is dependent on the bracket your in,since you can have made more last year and receive the same back on thie return, due to changes in the tax brackets.

mNzgWFkGaa	hey instead of asking on the Internet and getting a load of crappy and just downright wrong and idiotic  answers why don't you get the proper answer just by calling them to ask? That's part of their job at student loans it's not like if you ask "what if i never earn enough to start paying off this loan? " that they'll say "Ah right got  you! We're sending the heavy mob round to your door in the next 20 minutes to turn you upside down and empty that money out of your trouser pockets ya bass!   Honestly!    All i can tell you is that for a Scottish Student loan with the student loans company in Glasgow  If you never earn enough to start repaying your loan then the debt is written off when you turn 50 years of age.  ( that's if you took out a loan before you where 40 years old)  Of course you will have to supply all the relevant prove of earnings etc.. every year and always keep them informed of change of address.    Don't be afraid to just call them and ask all you want about repayments, they are not allowed to come round to your door with hammers honest!

He he.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	ask the loan company-it's probably different for each person|`|yNbGq4viaa	So, basically, what you're asking is...how long do I have to withhold payment on my loan before they stop hassling me about it and just write it off...correct?      You know, there are tons of kids out there applying for financial aid right now so that they can go to school and better themselves and you're sitting around trying to get out of paying back a debt.  Perfect...sounds like whatever minimal education you received was wasted on you anyway.      To answer your question though, once they "write off" your debt as uncollectable, it will have already gone into collections and will be reported on your credit.  If you ever go to apply for a car loan, home loan, etc. it will show up.  Also, they could and probably will issue a judgment against you because, really, it's the government you owe the money to if you applied for financial aid to a public university or if you got a Pell grant.  They don't mess around.  Not only could you suffer legal repercussions due to your failure to pay, you will have this on your credit for 7 years.  Even if you pay if off after that (which does look better on your credit report) you will still have damaged credit.  Not a good way to start out in life...especially in this economy.  Any job you apply for in the financial sector, etc. is going to check your credit.  Just as a side note, they can revoke your degree for failure to pay.  So four years of your time wasted all due to being a dead beat and not paying your bills.  They can also attach any tax refunds you may have coming to satisfy your debt.  They can also continue to renew your judgment for as long as they want until it is paid off.  So, really...they don't ever "write off" your debt.  Doesn't sound worth it to me.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Student loans are never "written off"     If you choose the income contingent repayment plan, you will have low payments for a while if your income stays low, but not forever.

Most lenders will allow you a certain amount of time to defer your payments, but eventually, the man will be knocking on your door.      You would need to check the terms of your loan to find out how long they will give you to find a decent paying job and start making your payments.  I've found that if you're honest with them, they tend to work with you if you have problems paying.  The only situation I can see where you might get out of it is if you die.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	You have to earn 15k per year before you have to start paying it off.

4Pk6VNftaa	The computer field is only going to expand by leaps and bounds in the coming years, as the technology continues to expand into different aspects of our life.<br>  <br>  What is it you want to actually do, though?  You may not need a masters degree.  Then again, you may end up getting a doctorate.  Personally I wouldn't worry that far into the future. <br>  <br>  Right now, load up on the math and science classes and get into a good university.  Then just work on getting your bachelor's degree. <br>  <br>  More importantly, I would recommend trying to get some work experience in the form of an internship or co-op.  Even in high school, see about going to an office to see what it's like to work in the field.  This will also make it much easier to actually find a job when you graduate from college. <br>  <br>  I would recommend working in the field for awhile before going back for your master's.  This will help you better determine what you want to study, and many companies will help pay for your education - even for a doctorate degree.

That could only be done if you went straight from one job to another.<br>  If you contact tax office with your form P45 details, staff may be able to calculate how much of your tax allowance you didn't use there and at hostel. Divide the amount of tax paid by 20, take that answer away from total pay, also homeless hostel earnings, and the answer should be the amount available. Then Tesco can make any repayment due. Do it asap, because we are nearly in March, and I don't know when Tesco run last payroll before the end of the tax year on 5th April. <br>  Make sure the correct code number is issued to Tesco for next year, probably 647L, less estimated hostel earnings.

There were some great ideas given already for your local market and you definitely need to go with those and get out there and meet all of the vets and even the pet sitters in your area.  People get pet sitters because they have animals with unique needs and you fill that need.<br>  <br>     I would also recommend working on your website.  People really need to be able to buy from your site.  Get an ecommerce site so you can ship it to them, I'm looking into cheap ones too, and am considering www.shopify.com or a store through Yahoo.<br>  <br>     After you get a store where people can buy you need to go find your buyers.

What if you offered to have a "tasting" at the pet shops?

Develop a three strategy approach with one end game - to be the expert.<br>  <br>  My advice is spend your time and money on:<br>  1. A web site that works for you, not against you<br>  - design, seo, and online marketing<br>  2. Jump into social networking<br>  - do your research first and pick 3 so you don't overwhelm yourself<br>  3. Network locally<br>  - chamber, network groups, doggie groups<br>  - start your own local meet up<br>  <br>  Focus on your end game. Yes you want to help people and their animals but you're not going to do it by selling your product alone unless you have deep pockets.

Review the tax return filing instructions including the recovery rebate credit worksheet. You need to know the amount of the payment you received in 2008, which can be found on your Economic Stimulus Payment Notice (Notice 1378). <br>  <br>  Two online tools on IRS.gov are available — the Recovery Rebate Credit Calculator will help taxpayers figure the amount they should claim on their 2008 tax return, and How Much Was My 2008 Stimulus Payment?

Enter  your recovery rebate credit on line 9 of Form 1040EZ, line 42 of Form 1040A and Line 70 of Form 1040. Do not report the stimulus rebate you have received on these lines. <br>  <br>  IRS made 115 million stimulus payments last year, so for most users the recovery rebate credit line will be blank or zero.

Net credit sales means credit sales minus related sales discounts minus related sales returns and allowances.<br>  <br>  Make sure you don't take credit sales minus sales returns which are related to cash sales. That will mess it up.|`|8J7ehCmiaa	Net credit sales are our total sales on account after the sales Returns and allowances and sales sidcounts have been subtracted out.

jw72N1moaa	Hiya, I live in Luton. There are worse towns than Luton, so ignore what others say.<br>  <br>  I would avoid Bury Park area. White are the minority, and you will often have abuse shouted at you if you go there. Also try and avoid Marsh Farm, it's quite rough around there. And also avoid High Town, again there are a lot of rough people living here, a few Polish and travellers.<br>  <br>  Barton area is a nice place, a lot of new build houses, but it is a little further out from the town centre, it's near the A6 on the way to bedford. Wigmore would be another option, they are all quite modern houses/new builds and it's quite nice, but you do get rough areas also.<br>  <br>  I live near Stopsley which has a nice village, not too far from the town centre by car. My area is Round Green It's quite a nice area in Luton, not a lot of trouble around, 25 min walk to town, 5 min car drive. Close to the airport and motorway, so it's quite an idyllic location. If I were you I would look into these areas, as they are quite central. Our postcode would be LU2.<br>  <br>  Look on www.rightmove.co.uk and type in the areas I've mentioned and see what you think.|`|L475HEEBaa	lol now that's a question I thought i would never hear!

12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	Have you written out a budget?  My biggest advice is to record all your expenses for each month.  Then esitmate how much money you can spend on food, entertainment, ect.  Keep all recipts and check your bank statement.<br>  <br>  My next advice is to think of some financial goals...and start an emergency fund.  So, think...hmm... well my mom's b-day is in 2 MONTHS and I want to buy her a flower membership which is $200.<br>  <br>  In the above you set the GOAL then TIME FRAME and the AMMOUNT.  Now you need the plan..."I will set aside $100 every month so I can afford it".  Or I will set aside $50 every month for 6 months for this goal....Just be specific in your goal, time, ammount, and plan...make sure you have guidlines that you can achieve and check yourself on.<br>  <br>  Open a savings account if you don't have one!!<br>  <br>  Next...I recommend talking to your bank about setting up a direct deposit to your savings account.  Like if you recieve your pay check on Fridays then ask your bank if you can do a "transfer of funds from checking to savings" automatically every Monday (after your paycheck..).  Make this a small ammount and be careful not to overdraft.  It will involve you watching your checking account a little more closely.  I like to use online banking for double checking my account before writing my bills.  So, have them transfer $10 or $20 (or a reasonable ammount) to your savings account.  Gradually, it will build.  (Although, slowly at a $10 or $20 rate but, save a reasonable ammount for your income you don't have to take money out unless it's an emergency (hence emergency fund).<br>  <br>  Later you should have enough money to invest in other accounts.  You could put in a good chunk for an IRA and then begin making small contributions to it.  Very inaccessable.<br>  <br>  I'd also suggest if use cash for groceries, spending, ect.  Only keep a small ammount in your purse.  Litterally, put the rest of your cash in a "piggy bank" or lock box...then when you have time (if you can't that day) run the money to the bank.  Don't use your debit card unless you have to...just write checks for your bills.  You will see the cash (only take a small ammount when you go out) and you'll be budgeting before you know it.<br>  <br>  Also, when you shop it's important to ask this question<br>  <br>  "What am I giving up by buying this thing...?"  "How will this impact my financial goals and future savings...?"  "Do I really need this??"<br>  <br>  Other tips for savings.....<br>  <br>  1) Cut trips to resturants...if you go only order water it saves a lot<br>  2) Rent a movie in instead of going to the theater all the time<br>  3) Invite friends over for dinner or your speciality dinner and have game night...it's fun and less expesnisve then going out<br>  4) Acutally, don't go shoping as much...I read about people just staying out of the mall right now b/c they can't afford the trips<br>  5) List some of your unwanted idems in storage on ebay or have a garage sale and then put that money in savings account<br>  6) Make shopping lists before you leave and try to stay out of the middle asiles...they usually contain all the junk you don't need or speciality items which you rarely need.<br>  7) Look over shopping adds before you leave and look at several stores..try to find the store that has the most items on sale that's on your list.  Circle the idems from the add and take it with you.<br>  8) Buy non-perishable or frozen items on sale in bulk.  If you have the space it will save you money.  Plan your meals around the sales.<br>  <br>  Talk w/ a financial advisor or your banker about savings and how it will beneift you.  Discuss setting up an account w/ acess but, making it more diffcult to get to your funds but, easy to but money in so can save more efficently.<br>  <br>  Bascially, if you write a budget and expenses and GOALS you'll learn why you don't want to buy that thing b/c you're saving for your future.  COMPOUNDING INTEREST! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kA4fWsR7aa	open up a bank account in which you can withdraw for a certain amount of time or you can always buy a piggy bank that you have to smash to get the money from, finally give it to a trusted family member and ask them to keep it safe for you|`|hdnI8ARiaa	set a goal to save, say 20 a week, and put 80 a month into a saving account to eventuallt get 1000 which you can then put into a locked CD for 6 months.|`|ieDarpkVaa	Go to walmart =D|`|MbzyriZ4aa	Have your bank set up a direct deposit from your checking account into a Money market account.<br>  <br>  Even if you just transfer $25 a month into the other account... you are saving and you don't even need to do anything about it.

It depends on your local labour law, but in some countries there is something known as 'constructive dismissal,' i.e. when someone makes your job hell so as to make you quit. In the UK it's quite hard to prove, but there are many successful cases as this is a common way for employers to try to avoid paying compensation for laying off.

MCCNJf5gaa	You must find out a variety of things><br>  1. How much is the assessed value of the home?<br>  2. How much is the fair market price for the home?<br>  3. Which mortgage did they default on, is it the first one or the second one, and is there a second one at all?<br>  4. Are there any other liens on the property?<br>  5. What year was the home built in?<br>  6.Are there any major problems with the home like plumbing, roof, foundation?<br>  7. How much time do they have left until the home goes up for auction?<br>  8. What is their ultimate goal bu selling the home? Is it to salvage their credit? Which usually is the case.<br>  But you will be able to find that out based on the price that is give to you anyway.<br>  You can go to www.zillow.com to find out what the fair market price is, based on the comparable homes, and then research the tax assessors office for the county that the property is in, and it should give you the info there on how much the house is assessed for.<br>  <br>  If you would like to buy the house, make sure you have an inspection done, because the house may look cosmetically in tact, but you cannot see the underlying problems in plumbing etc. So get an inspection done, very important.<br>  Also go to a Title Company and do a Title Research, to make sure that there are no other liens on the property, as you will buy those with the house.<br>  I suggest you also getting the support of a Real Estate Lawyer , in case something was to go ugly.

Was this a friend or someone that just called you out of the blue?<br>  <br>  First things first I would ask when the Notice of Default or NOD was listed. This will tell you when the foreclosure proceedings were started by the lender and it will also give you some sort of time frame as to how quickly you would need to move to possibly purchase the property.  If the owner calls the lender they will usually give a forebearance and an extension (usually 60-90 days)  Also check your county recorders website and confirm this information.<br>  <br>  2.  How much?  Sometimes you can get a great deal because the owner only wants out of the house and will sell it for what they owe to avoid a foreclosure..so look into this a little more. <br>  <br>  What state are you in?  If you are in Nevada, California, or Arizona you can email me and we can discuss further options for you.

Lo que te hace ganar un ascenso son varios factores mucho mas importantes, lo primero es que tus pares hoy, te vean como referente, digamos que eso te eleva por si mismo; tu actitud hacia el trabajo, tu flexibilidad y adaptacion a los cambios, la energía que le pongas al aprender cada dias algo nuevo.<br>  Porsupuesto que muchas personas por el solo hecho de tener mas antigüedad pueden conocer muchas mas cosas de la empresa que vos, pero tambien tené en cuenta que muchas veces, antigüedad solo es sinónimo de permanencia, hay muchos "antiguos" que no tienen compromiso con su empresa, ni son su trabajo, solo les interesa cobrar un sueldo haciendo el menor esfuerzo posible, y eso se nota.<br>  Y hay algo, que esta relacionado directamente con la antigüedad  en un puesto de trabajo, pero que es muy nocivo, y son los vicios propios del trabajo, vos al tener menos antigüedad no estas contaminado con cosas, que forman el circulo vicioso de toda empresa, y por tu actitud y tus ganas de crecimiento sos miembro del circulo virtuoso. No te dejes "chapear" por aquel que lo unico que tiene para lucir es su antigüedad en el empleo, por algo no muestra otras habilidades, hay que ver en el fondo, como utilizó todos esos a?os, y porque no fue seleccionado para un crecimiento anterior, ya que no creo sea esta la primera posibilidad de ascenso.<br>  Actitud positiva, y mucha suerte!!!!!!!!|`|9xRganhjaa	POLI PON TU CAPACIDAD COMO CARTA GANADORA!!!!DEMUESTRALES LO QUE HAS ECHO,MERECER ES SABER HACERLO QUIZAS TENGAN MAS ANIGUEDAD PERO TU TE DESAROLLLES MEJOR...SUERTE Y NO TE ACHIQUES QUE NO HAY GUERRA SIN PELEA PERO SIEMPRE CON ARMAS JUSTAS Y SANAS.....SUERTE MUCHAaaaaaaaaaaaaa|`|qRmztwdlaa	con seguridad y conocimientos, sin quererte ver por encima de todos por que esas actitudes caen mal|`|AA10492394	solo con hechos, demuestra que eres capaz de enfrentar los retos que se pongan enfrente|`|26046a9347bf7c4cfaa19492e8b6dad3aa	seguridad,tolerancia,no ser individualista,saber trabajar en equipo,escuchar,saber que tienes 1 función y no ocupar la d otros y por sobre todo no pisarle la cabeza a nadie para llegar a ese ascenso,conseguir todo por vos mismo y no te imaginas lo bien que te sentirás yo lo he experimentado y es bonísimo.y otra aprender a querer tu trabajo y no sentirlo como 1 obligación a cumplir,veras como consigues tu ascenso.Mucha suerte.|`|4ade908588ffad1f8e8604d9904d0486aa	primero SEGURIDADen ti misma, en tu forma de vestir, mas formal, de acuerdo a tu trabajo, en tu forma de caminar y hablar con los demas.<br>  <br>  AMABILIDADse muy atenta con el resto de tus compa?eros con todos mas aun con los que estan compitiendo contigo.<br>  esto te da puntos a tu favor.<br>  <br>  date cuenta que no tienes que demostrar superioridad, mas bien simpleza y mucho profesionalismo y responsabilidad en lo que haces, generalmente cae muy mal la gente nefasta que intenta llevarse bien con todos, o prepotentes que sienten que el mundo no los merece.<br>  <br>  no caigas en estos errores, se tu misma tratando de mejorar en estos aspectos, mucha suerte, ojala te den el puesto!!!|`|AA11586229	Ah, pues primero tienes que aprender a escribír y las reglas básicas de ortografía, convenser se escríbe en realidad "convencer", además te comíste toooodos los acentos, de lo demás, pues ya después hablamos, pero esto que te digo ahora es importantísimo...|`|KsOzMGzgaa	Simplemente debes mostrar seguridad...<br>  <br>  Mi blog es:<br>  <a href="http://soloelmundoyyo.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://soloelmundoyyo.blogspot.com</a>

kL41a5Bnaa	From hellodollar.com<br>  <br>  Eliminating Credit Card debt: Snowballing<br>  <br>  There are a bunch of systems that people use to get out of credit card debt. From talking to people who've successfully conquered credit cards, the system called "snowballing" debt seems to work well.<br>  <br>  The snowball system works like this:<br>  <br>  Say you have multiple sources of credit card debt. Each one has a different balance, interest rate, and minimum payment. You already know (from using Hello, Dollar's credit card payment calculator!) that only paying the minimum payment on each bill will take years and cost thousands in interest. So you work out a budget that includes some extra money for paying down those debts a little faster.<br>  <br>  So, how do you decide which to pay off first? Do you split up the extra money across all the bills? Do you apply all of it to the credit card with the highest ineterest rate?<br>  <br>  The snowball system says that you should ignore interest rates, and simply put all of your extra money into the debt with the smallest balance. This way you can get one of your credit cards paid off more quickly.<br>  <br>  Once the card with the lowest balance is paid off completely, take the extra money, plus the minimum payment for that card, and start applying it to the new lowest balance debt. Lather, rise, and repeat.<br>  <br>  This way, every card you pay off means that much more money paid on the next one. Your total monthly payment never changes until you're out of debt, but the amount on any given card gets bigger and bigger, hence the snowball.<br>  <br>  That's all there is to it! Pretty simple, right?<br>  Why it Works<br>  The biggest advantage to snowballing is mostly psychological. It feels great, and keeps you motivated, to see real progress so quickly.<br>  <br>  It's also simple to figure out -- it doesn't require you to worry about interest rates. If you did pay off your highest interest debt first, you might save more money than by snowballing. But that's moot if you get discouraged by the apparent lack of progress, or by the complexity, and give up.<br>  <br>  The other advantage is that the snowball system eliminates any temptation to start paying a smaller amount as you near your goals, stretching out the time (and interest money!) it takes to get you debt free.<br>  <br>  Like any other debt elimination plan, snowballing debt only works if you stop charging! Put the credit cards in a drawer, cut them up, whatever it takes to keep you from getting back into debt! Sure, it might take some frugal living, but that, my friends, is the secret of wealth.|`|USzpMWs6aa	I have an example of this on my blog at <a href="http://www.josephsangl.com/?p=20" rel="nofollow">http://www.josephsangl.com/?p=20</a><br>  <br>  You can use the Debt Freedom Date Calculator on my "Tools" page as well to calculate the number of months until you become debt-free!

There is little room for manouverability on the accused part.<br>  <br>  If its an employee accusing another employee, then its back to proof again, and is much more difficult. This is because the employer may not want to do anything unless they have actually <br>  witnessed/ or proved it themselves, <br>  I say this because its easy for one employee to put company property in another empoyees coat/bag etc, and then report it, thus framing the 3rd person.

What this is is a card that you actually purchase from your local credit union for however much you desire and they in turn report the activity on it to the credit bureau. How it works is if you purchase a $500 card and use it during the month and then refill it at the end of each month then it will be reported as a card in good standings. It is the fastest safest and easiest way to establish good credit.

On the high end, you could make basically an unlimited amount, however; all people I know, which means if I know them, they are not big time, have second and third jobs. They need this because when their modeling, dancing, singing does pay, it is only a few thousand dollars and generally this only happens a few times a year. So if you can make it on like $9,000 to $12,000 a year, then you will be set, but otherwise, expect to wait tables, be an "assistant", or do other "non-cool" jobs (like telemarketing) while you wait to make it big, if that ever happens, and of course the odds are against you, so it probably won't. But this is America so anything can happen, if you think you got it, then stick to it, otherwise... be prepared for disaster.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)

AA10464818	You stand a greater chance of getting a government-guaranteed loan through the Small Business Administration <a href="http://www.sba.gov/financing" rel="nofollow">http://www.sba.gov/financing</a> than a government grant. Read the SBA Financing page to learn about criteria needed for borrowing <br>  <br>  It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) <a href="http://www.cfda.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfda.gov</a> and Grants.gov <a href="http://www.grants.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.grants.gov</a> - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.<br>  <br>  <br>  Even SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website <a href="http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html</a><br>  <br>  "The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See <a href="http://www.sba.gov/financing" rel="nofollow">http://www.sba.gov/financing</a> for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance.

It is then processed and packaged. weight and dimensions are calculated and your product is then labeled to ship by whatever shipping company the warehouse chooses to use. There is also blind shipping, where the origin company is hidden from the recipient.

If you give into it at this stage of your life, you are setting yourself up for disappointment down the road.  <br>  <br>  Because your friend has a big beautiful house doesn't mean she's happy.   She probably does take it for granted.  Ever watch the Real Kids of the OC?  Ridiculous  - the sense of entitlement they have, and no appreciation for all their parents have done to get them that lifestyle.  <br>  <br>  Because you live in a smaller house doesn't mean you should be depressed.  Some of the happiest people I know create that themselves, it doesn't come from money, houses or things, it comes from inside.  Find something that makes you happy and do it.  Whether it is a hobby, a sport, getting a part time job to help get your family that new house, find your joy and go for it.  <br>  <br>  Now, pick yourself up and start living.  There is no time like the present.  Hiding in your room will not make good things suddenly happen.

Ways to help her out are to cook dinner a couple of nights a week so that you guys don't waste money on meals out.  Babysit any younger siblings for free so that she can work extra hours.  Get a job yourself (even 13-14 year olds can babysit) and start to buy your own clothing, movies etc.  Be the household energy miser making sure nobody is wasting electricity or heat!  Just by helping out around the house you can help her confidence and give her the extra energy that housebuilding and financing takes!<br>  <br>  Good Luck.  Sitting around in your room depresses everybody and makes your Mom spend needless time worrying about you!<br>  <br>  If you want to make your friend know how lucky she is then invite her over to spend the weekend with you!

bdfa59d7b07a9f8d87b377a23b2a1873aa	The following are accepted standards in the job market. Follow them if you want to make a positive first impression.<br>  <br>  Women:<br>  · Don't wear your skirts too short or too tight, heels to high, or blouses too low and too sheer.<br>  · Skip the loud nail colors and long nails. Keep your makeup subtle.<br>  · Carry an extra pair of stockings just in case and wear them, even in the summer.<br>  · Don't wear too much jewelry; keep it simple. Don't wear lots of earrings. <br>  · Conservative blouse and suit, with skirt not too short, sensible heels, subtle make up and jewelry. Fill only one hole with earrings if you have many. Never wear large hoop earrings. (This will vary from country to country and the type of job being applied for).<br>  <br>  Men<br>  · Don't wear an earring.<br>  · Keep your nails clean and trimmed and remember to shave.<br>  · Wear knee length socks that match your pants to avoid "the sock gap."<br>  · A dark suit, white shirt, tie and dark oxford shoes. (This will vary from country to country and the type of job being applied for).<br>  <br>  Everyone<br>  · If you think you need a haircut, get one.<br>  · Don't splash on too much perfume or aftershave. Many people are allergic to scents.<br>  · Don't wear a nose ring.<br>  · Take a shower that morning and wear a deodorant.<br>  · Polish your shoes and press your clothes the night before.<br>  · Absolutely don't chew gum or smoke.<br>  · If you suffer from sweaty palms, keep a handkerchief with a little baby powder or cornstarch in it. Before your interview, go into the restroom and dry your hands with it.<br>  · Go to the interview alone. Don't bring a friend or relative.<br>  · Get a good night's sleep the night before.<br>  <br>  <br>  Peace and every blessing!|`|f2c7823e19d5de30bfdb8c04bf2deaf0aa	Avoid heavy makeup, low-cut necklines (in fact, any tank top is just wrong for work).  No T-shirts with sayings or logos on them. No naked belly strip. No flip-flops.  Hair pulled back from the face.  Cover up tattoos. Wear a clean, ironed shirt with buttons and a collar, and plain pants that are not jeans. <br>  Be on time for an interview.  Know what your resume says, and have it be true. Look them in the eye and shake hands when you introduce yourself.<br>  Don't be someone who might bring personal problems to work - have reliable transportation, don't talk about partying roommates or unpaid bills.  For instance, loss of your driver's license because of unpaid fines will look like major flakiness to a manager. So is sleeping on a friend's couch.  If you're between homes, don't volunteer it.  Never gossip about other staff, or talk loudly about your personal dating adventures while at work.<br>  Also, make an appointment to see the manager, he or she is busy,so don't just arrive and expect their attention.. Stop in but be dressed for an interview (first impressions are everything), ask if they have a minute just to meet you so you can leave an application or resume, and then set an appointment for when the manager has time to interview you. <br>  Ask a lot of questions to show you are interested in the job, and try to find out something about the company ahead of time, and share that in the interview.  Be pleasant and thank them for their time.  Then ask when you can call back to find out their decision, and do it.  <br>  Mostly, we want someone who looks tidy, is polite, won't scare grandma with obvious piercings or tattoos, and will show up reliably on time and be pleasant.  And you have to work - merely being present at work is not enough to collect your pay - know what you're expected to do and get it done!<br>  Best of luck in your job search.
AA10138626	Well first of all if you have a good job don't quit that to look for something new. If you already have a new job lined out it could work. Going to college definitely increases your chances of getting more and different kinds of jobs, but is by no means necessary to be successful.

You can talk to the professor's about careers in the different areas, and then maybe you will find an area you would like to concentrate in.  If you challenge yourself to take a diverse schedule of college courses, you will have no problem finding something you enjoy and even something you will be great at!<br>  I wish you the best of luck.

To sell their homes people are accepting 10% or lower than the house was worth.  They are also adding incentives to prospective buyers such as leaving the furniture, giving a new car, giving a vacation just to sell the house.  I would suggest that you go to your realtor and see if you could rent the house (if you could get enough to pay the PITI monthly).  If people rent to own then they will take care of the home.  This is what is being suggested by a lot of realtors and financial gurus.

This will allow you to keep the property. However, there are several disadvantages to this and you must be aware of them in advance.  A limited forbearance agreement may allow the lender to receive various benefits that may be very helpful in the event of a subsequent default, meltdown of the credit or foreclosure.<br>  <br>  2) You may consider a short-sale and either negotiate a waiver of any future deficiency judgment (if one is possible to be obtained by the lender and other lien holders) or simply accept responsibility for any deficiency remaining on the balance.

This money placed in the reserves affects the book value of the lender since it can not be shown as an asset in their books, used to get interest on and it can not be released until the funds are recovered through a sale. Enough of those can cause a lender to go under.|`|BQpmOUrVaa	First, every bank is different so no, I do not think they are more receptive to offers at any particular time of year.

Most foreclosures were not taken care of and need work to make them sellable. In some cases, brokers such as myself will be offered the home to move.

Q34PVMgEaa	Untuk menjawab pertanyaan perusahaan mana yang menjual produk pensiun, saya rasa hampir semua perusahaan asuransi saat ini menjual produk tersebut (c/ UNIT LINK), yang penting anda memilih perusahaan dan agent yang cukup terpercaya. Karena pensiun plan adalah untuk investasi jangka panjang, maka sebaiknya dimulai dari sekarang. <br>  Kalau mengenai pertanyaan memiliki 2 M di tangan, tergantung kepada portofolio anda, jika saya sudah memiliki tabungan dana darurat dan untuk kebutuhan keluarga (anak , dll), sehingga 2 M tsb hanya untuk pensiun plan, maka saya tidak akan taruh semua di bank , karena jika untuk kebutuhan pensiun, berarti hingga saya berumur hingga 70 thn bahkan bisa lebih, sehingga saya hrs taruh di investasi jangka panjang. Mungkin hanya sekitar 300-400 juta saya taruh di deposito (deposito=investasi jk.pendek), sisanya saya belikan UNIT LINK , di Fund SAHAM , sehingga saya bisa mendapatkan return tinggi + proteksi asuransi sampai saya berumur 70 thn. Karena kalau tidk mempunyai proteksi, begitu didiagnosa suatu penyakit, maka semua uang itu akan SEGERA HABIS.................Kebayang donk mahalnya biaya RS skrg/5 thn/10 thn nanti ?<br>  Jika tertarik dgn Unit Link, saya dpt menjelaskan lebih lanjut, kirim ke email saya, fan_oche@yahoo.com atau buka web saya di bawah.<br>  tx|`|1jdrP4Niaa	salam kenal pak,<br>  <br>  sebelumnya saya salut dengan bapak karena termasuk salah satu org yang sudah berpikir mengenai pensiun plan.

Jika usia anda 45 tahun dan punya 2 M di tangan. Beberapa hal yang harus diajukan pada diri kita:<br>  <br>  1. Berapa biaya hidup bulanan jika anda pensiun sekarang dan hidup hingga usia ... let say 70 tahun (berarti 25 tahun lagi)? Termasuk inflasi dan biaya asuransi karena kita butuhkan untuk sewaktu2 sakit, ingat semakin tua mayoritas kita kesehatan cenderung semakin menurun jadi dana darurat untuk kesehatan perlu sekali (dan preminya makin tua makin mahal). Cukup ga ya 2M??<br>  <br>  2. Untuk penempatan, ada beberapa alternatif, penempatan di finansial aset (deposito, obligasi, saham, reksadana dsb) atau real aset (rumah, komoditas seperti emas, barang kolektif seperti lukisan). Masing-masing memiliki resiko, sangat tergantung dengan profil kita dalam menilai resiko mana yang bisa kita terima. Dan resiko itu tidak lurus, dalam artian jika saya menghindari resiko yang satu maka saya akan terkena resiko yang lain (contoh: taruh di deposito, resiko penurunan nilai TIDAK ADA, tapi maksimal perlindungan jaminan pemerintah 100 juta jika banknya bangkrut dan resiko penurunan nilai uang karena tingkat bunga lebih kecil dari tingkat inflasi rata-rata)<br>  <br>  3. Dalam penempatan/alokasi tentukan tujuan anda, untuk mendapatkan income regular, peningkatan modal awal atau keduanya (ini butuh sedikit trik dano pengetahuan dasar investasi). <br>  Itu tadi sekelumit hal yang perlu diperhatikan tentang rencana kita jika ingin pensiun, banyak aspek lain yang belum disampaikan, tapi ini yang paling dasar.<br>  <br>  Menjawab pertanyaan berikutnya:<br>  Diantara kedua hal yang anda usulkan, hasilnya akan kurang optimal jika kita belum tahu berapa kebutuhan kita. Keduanya memberikan jaminan akan hasil (bunga dan income regular dari pembelian pensiun plan) tetapi tidak terlindungi dari bahaya inflasi. Jika anda agak awam dengan instrumen investasi yang tersedia di pasar, dan anda kuatir tertipu (biasanya sales cenderung conflict of interest antara kebutuhannya dengan kebutuhan klien), coba anda konsultasikan dengan Konsultan Keuangan Independen (tidak terkait dengan institusi finansial tertentu). Saya bisa beri referensi kepada anda. Karena mereka punya kode etik profesi yang mengharuskan mereka untuk beretika jujur dan objektif, serta punya keahlian khusus di dibidang yang anda tanyakan. Mungkin anda harus bayar fee per jamnya, tetapi solusi yang diberikan worth sekali dibandingkan jika kita salah mengambil langkah dalam penempatan uang.    <br>    |`|dRbCR8Wkaa	Pertama: konsultasi dgn pernecana keuangan, emang harus bayar.<br>  Kedua : Belajar sendiri dunia perencanaan keuangan lewat internet aja, banyak banget. yang penting kuat koneksi ke internetnya.<br>  <br>  Dana yg nganggur kalo cuma dismpan di bank sbg tabungan atau deposito akan kalah/tergerus nilainya oleh Inflasi. Apalagi kalo dana tsb sudah jelas peruntukkannya, akan lebih baik ditumbuhkembangkan.<br>  Harus mengerti konsep Value of Money, krn uang 2M sekarang belum tentu cukup/layak untuk dana pensiun nanti. Itu tadi karena ada inflasi.<br>  <br>  Jangan lupa, emas(logam mulia) harus dipertimbangkan untuk mendiversifikasikan resiko modal kita. Dimana kita bisa berinvestasi yaitu di pasar modal, property, atau emas. Cuma kalo investasi ada hukumnya yaitu high return high risk juga, tinggal gimana kita mengelolanya saja. Apalagi untuk tujuan jangka panjang.<br>  <br>  Opini BRO boleh juga tuh...|`|dpGAKaUZaa	saran saya sih,<br>  1. Anda bisa mengikuti program asuransi jiwa plus kesehatan untuk Anda dan masing2 anggota keluarga Anda. karena kita tidak tahu apa yang akan terjadi nanti.<br>  2.

Dengan membayar sejumlah uang setiap bulannya, anda akan dapat pembayaran kembali ketika masa non produktif sesuai dengan besaran/nilai yang diinginkan/direncanakan.

Tapi ini sifatnya temporer, paling dalam kondisi normal 6% atau net sekitar  Rp.8 juta.<br>  <br>  Karena uang anda bersifat untuk jangka panjang, sebaiknya anda masukkan sebagian (misal Rp. 1M) ke lembaga pensiun yang mendapat backup dari Pemerintah, misalnya asuransi Jiwa Sraya.<br>  <br>  Anda pada umur 45 masih sangat produktif, pasti tidak akan tahan pensiun muda, untuk itu uang Rp 1M dapat untuk usaha yang bersifat tidak mengikat.<br>  <br>  Salam<br>  Abun

0oqlAmeJaa	You have to consider the fact that your boss has a boss and they must have put a lot of thought into what would be best for the company as a whole.  Those other two probably are good enough as far as they are concerned to do the job required for that particular position.  How you feel probably is not the most important factor to a leader who is responsible for keeping a company in profit mode.<br>  <br>  I've been in uncomfortable situations like this myself.  I know its not easy but you may want to show them teamwork and appreciation and a commitment to helping them achieve the goals of the company rather than questioning their judgment at this sensitive time in the company's life.|`|f9d88043d8ba88ae6d8cec415fe76179aa	Catch your breath and calmly talk to your boss.  Let him know you are concerned and are looking for a better understanding of what is going on with all the changes.|`|c9f0a92e7503f5ddf64a5ec44334d126aa	Neither of which. It's just changing of title. Don't be fooled by the "Manager" title. If there is no adjustment of package, then its really just a change of title. <br>  If your boss do not bother to explain or justify a good explanation, then its a very good time to move on after you had gotten your bonus.
0XyyWIetaa	You seem well prepared you can already consider yourself hired. Don't forget to ask any quick questions about the position, you don't want to get your first job and realize you don't want to do it.|`|99627679e5ff762bfc852fc768cb2601aa	Well so far everything sounds good. I'm sure your a very intelligent person so you already know that presentation is key. Another thing is, you must find some sort of way to stick out, what other skills and traits make you that much more valuable then the hundreds of applicants that your competing with? In the past I've told many employers that I'd simply be the best employee they'd ever have...I'm just brutally honest and very confident. I've always exceeded their expectations as well, thats just how I've always operated. I'd say something that would leave a lasting impression as you turn in your "App"...good luck.|`|AA12351706	My best advice to you, and I'm sure I'm 2X your age, is to walk in with confidence! Have faith in your abilities and most important BELIEVE the job is all ready yours! CLAIM it.  When you meet with the manager for your interview let him know your degrees, accomplishments, and strongest points first - and how you will be an asset to his business.  Let him know "what you can bring to the table rather than what you can get out."  You never get a 2nd chance to make a good 1st impression!|`|E7M1VU94aa	you might tell him why you want the job other than the obvious and what sought you to find employment at that particular place. the rest seems pretty good. dress nice. and simply. if you have long hair,well groomed and pulled back. pharmacies like the clean approach. mention any special math or computer skills.|`|SkeXUHROaa	that sounds good... you're only handing him the app so you don't need to do much
2GRH7vHWaa	Typically a Bachelors degree if you want to work for a public aquarium.  I would say a PhD if you plan to be a researcher, professor, etc.  There are many areas that marine biologists are helping with; new drug discovery efforts, conservation, working for the state and local governments, and working on humanity projects like aquaculture.<br>  <br>  Check out some of the larger aquariums in the US to learn more (Montery Bay, Georgia Aquarium, Shead's in Chicago) about those careers, you can also go to the Dept of Labor (DOL.gov) for gov't data.  <br>  <br>  The career improves lives by providing knowledge about oceanic life including climate change, animal population studies, changes in our seas, etc.  <br>  <br>  Salary.com might have some salary information.  I was making about $12/hr as an intern 10 years ago.  I would say aquarium marine biologists are in the $40-45K range, researchers (PhD level) working for a gov't agency might be in the $45-60K range.  That might be a little high, I am just guessing.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|qGbrRHRtaa	google!<br>  <br>  or try the occupational outlook handbook.<br>  <br>  search for that in google!|`|zTH1Kw3Aaa	try monster.com

8UeNi9OZaa	A Certified Public Accountant is a designation available in the US to document a basic knowledge of accounting, auditing, and commercial law.  You must have a college degree in accounting and to be licensed you must practice for a year under the tutelage of a licensed cpa.  The term Chartered Accountant is roughly equivalent in the UK, Australia, Canada, India, and probably most of the Commonwealth.  I'm sure that the licensing and certification vary somewhat by country and state.  
OacSIfSiaa	First of all never trust a web site that states "By submitting your request, you are granting permission for up to 3 of our consultants to contact you even if you are on the no call list"  Sound shady to me.<br>  <br>  Also never trust a site that does not have a link to their policies or to even email a question too.  This site is just to trap someone into being hounded to death on the phone.<br>  <br>  ALSO, this web site has no certificates and is not encrypted which means anybody can get your information.<br>  <br>  If a web site is secured with a certificate you can tell by their webb address, it should show shttp// instead of http// and you can right click your mouse and a window will appear, select "properties" and check for details.<br>  <br>  Good thing your friend changed her mind.<br>  Hope this answers your question.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Scam.

Absolutely do not give out any personal info.  It could be just an ID theft scam.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of debt settlement companies out there.  They take monthly payments from you and allow all your accounts to go 90 days past due.  Then they offer lowball settlement offers under threat you will file bankruptcy.  Not only does this trash your credit, most credit card companies refuse to play and will immediately sue you.<br>  <br>  You can negotiate settlement with old debt yourself.  You don't need to pay a third party.|`|zQBxbzvjaa	No!  Never do business with this kind of company.<br>  <br>  1) First of all they use unsolicited spam email<br>  2) Secondly they suggested using AIM to do a financial transaction, that is horribly insecure.<br>  3)  Read their website, it says three of their 'partners' will call you even if you are on the Do Not Call list.  Isn't that wrong?<br>  <br>  |`|hutoPgliaa	Don't trust it.<br>  Companies like that make more money out of you than they actually pay towards the original debt - which you could negotiate yourself, and be a whole lot better off.|`|5IB8Fwdeaa	its all a rip off|`|W1KLQZxAaa	Well, for one, the links at the bottom such as "verisign" are not linked to the actual site!!<br>  It's a scam.

AA10259042	This is the most difficult question to answer.  The financial crisis that the U S finds itself in--actually created is a better term--may not be all that easy to resolve.  Most would suggest standing pat with the 401k.  Until recently I would have also suggested that.  Now I am not so sure that would be the correct answer any longer. <br>  <br>   Things surely do not look too good going forward.  There is a school of thought that when things look the worst, that is when a turn around is most likely.  I am a member of that school; but as bad as things look they keep looking worse the next day so it is somewhat argumentative any longer as to when the worst is going to occur.  If you happened to have watched Cramer last night, you would have noticed that his philosophy has recently changed significantly.  He is now talking about having serious economic problem for the next 5 years, and that one needs sufficient cash on hand to last 5 years.  This is about as pessimistic as I have ever seen him.  Perhaps that is a sign that we are near a bottom.  Then again perhaps not.  <br>  <br>  Depending on what you have your 401k invested in,  it might be prudent to reallocate some of those assets just in case the worst is yet to happen.  Perhaps you have an option of a money market account in which to place some of your assets.   Not all but some maybe 25% to 35%.  For now at least leaving the remained where it is invested.   <br>  <br>  If it should happen that there is another great depression, which is no longer out of the question, in about 3 years that 25% that is in cash equivelents should have a heck of a lot of buying power in the equities markets and will work to recover the losses suffered by the other 75%. |`|UDxL7lPqaa	If you are five or more years from retiring, stay with it.|`|oojO4WAraa	Depends on your age.  The markets will eventually go back up.  If you are young you will probably be okay leaving your money where it is at.   Mine has gone down 23%.  Sucks!!!|`|qBCGH52haa	Depends on how long you have to wait until retirement.  If you have a relatively long time, moving your investments now will lock in the loss and inevitably place you in historically less rewarding investment vehicles.  Over time, the stock market has the best rate of return, but with that rate comes risk.  <br>  <br>  Having said that, if you are convinced we are headed into a recession or depression, then for peace of mind you might want to switch.  If you are optimistic about the intermediate outlook for the economy and can ignore the fluctuations that are sure to roil the markets for the forseeable future, then possibly your best bet is to stay the course.|`|hY81Xxygaa	Wait it out.  If you cash out now you will be cashing out at the bottom of the market.  This market will turn upwards. It will take time. do not panic. I purchased financial stocks although the financial sector is in the doldrums.  But stocks are cheap and I will hold on to it for next five to ten years.|`|RNvUoLXbaa	STAY!

This inquiry is done with only one, depending on who the bank works with. But, once the acct is open... this information is provided to the credit bureaus... and yes will reflect on your credit report that you have these 'open accts' but does not necessarily affect your credit score.<br>  <br>  So to answer ur question, NO, the inquiry for opening the account is likely to be with just the one credit bureau. =D|`|XXIpmAL4aa	Their inquiry may show up, but the account will never show up as a regular reportable line item unless it's charged off with a negative balance.<br>  |`|m3wK5WLgaa	I do not think your bank info shows up, I have several bank accounts and that never affected my credit good or bad standing.. but go to the bank and ask. |`|neNfeluIaa	You can check all 3 for free at annualcreditreport.com
SK2gGFoyaa	You have alot of options available if you consider the time and talents that you have. There's no reason you cannot start up your own business that will make money doing what you love and loving what you do. Check your library for books like "Fast Cash for Kids" by Bonnie & Noel Drew. Your Librarian can hook you up with other titles that can help to educate and inspire you. You can sell products, services or a combination of the two. Your parents can help you get a legitimate business running so they get tax credits and you get money and experience. What are your hobbies that can turn to business??? What do you enjoy doing? What equipment do you have??? Short of guns, alcohol and tobacco there are alot of things you can sell. Why not make 100% of profits after taxes and expenses are paid? Look into permits, taxes, and the other legal and financial issues of business and you will keep more of the income you generate. Get started today to read business books or to write a simple business plan. There are many home businesses that are huge corporations now. Why not let your business be one of them??? Don't wait for your ship to come in ... swim out to meet it.<br>  |`|80df948c33b8e772d4a35ce0f8072db9aa	In Australia, the working age is 14 and 9 months, most employers won't employ anyone younger, however, as a bit of extra pocket money, there is a range of jobs and tasks that can make money.<br>  Newspaper runs are good, though it would depend what the employment age is. You could set up a lemonade stand. I know it's probably not what your thinking, but think outside the box. Why not try a yard sale. I am sure you would have a few old things that you want to sell. Make sure though you talk it over with your family, and check to make sure that they don't want to pass some items to siblings or baby cousins. Another idea, is go to a local cafe or store and ask if they need anything done. Now a day with the economic situation, people are trying to spend less, and much of the time, people employ younger people because they don't require to pay as much as they would with an adult. The cafe or general store may need someone to tidy shelves, sweep or do little things that may end up being profitable for you. If you live on a farm, or know of farm jobs, a good thing, (if you have the right skills) is to help out at a local stable. You might be able to help tidy tack sheds, or clean stables or sweep and the stable floors. If you have experience with cattle etc, maybe you could feed them or if they show them, have a go at it. I used to show cattle when I was in High School, and though I didn't get paid, it was fun and rewarding. This one family whoed their cattle, and won prizes and let others show them, I heard they got a pretty good cut of the prize money. Just an idea. Im not sure what your thoughts are, but look around. My father said when he was young, they would collect bottles and cans, and there would be a 5cent refund on them. It's not much, but imagine 300 cans at 5cent, thats already $15, and all it took was a bit of scaverging and you could even post up signs around your area. Make up some excuse that you need them for science or something, or simply say your doing something with them. Neighbours come in handy with this. However, never try to pretend your raising money for organisations or donations. You don't have to tell people your saving money, but don't lie about what its going towards. Simply don't say unless they ask. Good luck.|`|leKIN9x8aa	Start up a kid crew, where you provide lawn cutting and clean up to senior citizens or anyone that needs help around the house. Use your dads lawn mower at first or theirs. that's what I did as a teenager along with being a caddy at a golf coarse. Being a caddy is fun and rewarding as a kid. If you have a good eye and watch the shot and where it lands  would make you a good caddy due to the cost of golf balls. You also will get to play for free on certain days to learn yourself. It's a very challenging game. You might like it so much you'll want to join the team when your in HS.

In economics and business decision-making, sunk costs are costs that cannot be recovered once they have been incurred. Sunk costs are sometimes contrasted with variable costs, which are the costs that will change due to the proposed course of action, and prospective costs which are costs that will be incurred if an action is taken. In microeconomic theory, only variable costs are relevant to a decision. Economics proposes that a rational actor does not let sunk costs influence one's decisions, because doing so would not be assessing a decision exclusively on its own merits. The decision-maker may make rational decisions according to their own incentives; these incentives may dictate different decisions than would be dictated by efficiency or profitability, and this is considered an incentive problem and distinct from a sunk cost problem.

An independent contractor is suppose to be a licensed business who furnishes their own tools while working, and not associated with the business for which they are being contracted with. The work you are doing there, is definitely and employee related job description. I think the office will get into trouble very quickly doing this.<br>  <br>  As for your part, you are right. You will not be paying into social security, state disability, and would be responsible for paying all your own taxes on your income. You are not in business, would have no write offs, so you would pay much higher income tax.

On a separate note, there is a hold on 'unfair charges' cases at the moment until an official decision has been made as to whether or not the charges are in fact, unfair.

979f2916175ef59c99b2c94ade06b045aa	In the US, copyright your work at www.copyright.gov. That is the only way you can defend your copyright in court. However, it must be your original work. You cannot steal photos off of the internet and copyright something with those photos in it. All of the work must be original; or if not original, you must have the creator's written permission to include them in your copyrighted work.<br>  <br>  The way in which copyright protection is secured is frequently misunderstood. No publication or registration or other action in the Copyright Office is required to secure copyright.<br>  <br>  Copyright is secured automatically when the work is created, and a work is “created” when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first time. “Copies” are material objects from which a work can be read or visually perceived either directly or with the aid of a machine or device, such as books, manuscripts, sheet music, film, videotape, or microfilm. “Phonorecords” are material objects embodying fixations of sounds (excluding, by statutory definition, motion picture soundtracks), such as cassette tapes, CDs, or LPs. Thus, for example, a song (the “work”) can be fixed in sheet music (“copies”) or in phonograph disks (“phonorecords”), or both. If a work is prepared over a period of time, the part of the work that is fixed on a particular date constitutes the created work as of that date.<br>  <br>  The use of a copyright notice is no longer required under U.S. law, although it is often beneficial. Because prior law did contain such a requirement, however, the use of notice is still relevant to the copyright status of older works.<br>  <br>  In general, copyright registration is a legal formality intended to make a public record of the basic facts of a particular copyright. However, registration is not a condition of copyright protection. Even though registration is not a requirement for protection, the copyright law provides several inducements or advantages to encourage copyright owners to make registration. Among these advantages are the following: <br>  <br>  Registration establishes a public record of the copyright claim. <br>  Before an infringement suit may be filed in court, registration is necessary for works of U.S. origin. <br>  If made before or within 5 years of publication, registration will establish prima facie evidence in court of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate. <br>  If registration is made within 3 months after publication of the work or prior to an infringement of the work, statutory damages and attorney's fees will be available to the copyright owner in court actions. Otherwise, only an award of actual damages and profits is available to the copyright owner. <br>  Registration allows the owner of the copyright to record the registration with the U. S. Customs Service for protection against the importation of infringing copies. For additional information, go to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website at www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/import. Click on “Intellectual Property Rights.” <br>  Registration may be made at any time within the life of the copyright. Unlike the law before 1978, when a work has been registered in unpublished form, it is not necessary to make another registration when the work becomes published, although the copyright owner may register the published edition, if desired.

qBCGH52haa	If you are in the U.S., most of your rights expired with your contract.  As long as they continued to pay you for work performed, you would be considered an at-will employee and they have as much right to terminate you as you had to walk out the door and never return.  The contract terms were fulfilled, and as such, there is no more contract.|`|cpyENCTcaa	I am afraid they can do this but they have to follow at the very minimum the 3 step ACAS dismissal procedure. Step 1 is inviting you to the meeting to discuss it (have they told you, you have the right to be accompanied at this meeting by either a colleague or a Trade union rep (even if company doesn't have trade unions). They put forward their case for not renewing your contract, you give your argument for why they should keep you, they adjourn to consider and they may decide to dismiss (so step 2 is your dismissal in writing) Step 3 is your right to appeal this process within 5 days. Having no contract since November is irrelevant, any employment tribunal would consider your old one to continue by the very fact that you have been working in the same way since last year. This means that the notice in your contract is still applicable. Hope this helps, its not good I know to loose a job like this but if they do it correctly it is legal......Oh and yes it would be perfectly normal and Professional to expect you continuing working just as you would have worked in August if Sept had been your last month. Suspension is usually where you have been accused of something and the company feels they can investigate the allegations in your absence|`|4b81a16cbb26c3702aa40a16058d31e4aa	No, it was not illegal for them to keep you on without a contract.  Although the promises that they were trying to extend it may have been annoying, the employee always tends to look at it from the "glass is half empty" side, instead of putting faith that it may be the truth.  Next, it may be the global economy that kept them from extending it.  Trust me, it's happening EVERYWHERE.  I work for a German company as their US Sales Manager and I sweat bullets every day that my job will go away.    If they paid you during the contract lapse and you cashed the checks (and why wouldn't you?), then no one did anything illegal.  However, in the case they string you along and ALSO do not pay you, then they are doing something illegal.    Cheeky Monkeys!

Then, I got $1000 tax credit for each child. Plus $300 more for my son since he was born after the stimulus rebates came out last year.     That reduced the total tax I paid for 2008 to less than $400. BUT... when you factor in the $1500 I got for the stimulus rebate, it means the government actually paid me $1200 for making almost $70 grand in the year 2008.

If you have a lot of extra forms, such as self-employment, business, or you itemize, it's likely that the provider will charge extra.    But yes, in most cases, if you go to the IRS and choose one of the freefile providers, it will be much cheaper, even with extra fees.

I did my own a little while ago without missing a payment and got one year at 1% the next year at 3% then a year at 5% the next at 5.5% and then locked in for the remainder of my mortgage at 6.25%.    Give it a try. I am currently $60,000 upside down.     That is also good information to pass on to them. If they are greedy make them think that you will stop paying and they will get a house back after spending $40,000 to foreclosure that is worth even less.    There are also lots of companies out there that will help you with that process. Watch out!!! They can only collect upfront fees if they are licensed mortgage brokers. The exact rules vary from state to state but know that there is now a huge business in taking advantage of distressed homeowners.|`|8yQYmxVOaa	Not going to happen, 6.5% is not bad and add the costs of refi especially out of equity would really not do you any good, remember you also lose out on interest to be deducted on taxes.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	You can't do anything and refinancing with negative equity is impossible.    You could afford the payments when you bought it and that didn't change...the fact that the house has gone down in value is 100% irrelevant b/c no one gave you a guarantee that it would remain the same and go up.    You can't live anywhere for free..just stay put....the market will eventually correct itself, but it doesn't happen overnight.    If you have a fixed rate...you are better off than most.|`|qBCGH52haa	Very doubtful - the equity secures the loan...being underwater eliminates part of the collateral, which is against underwriting rules.|`|7ab5cfb44c01bb054a6a928a94becb65aa	No one is going to refi with no equity.    A refi is basically a new loan to pay off an old loan.  So your new lender will have nothing to secure your property other than it's current value (which lenders don't trust right now since so many people are walking away from homes their upside down on -- even if they CAN pay for them), they won't do it.    A 6.5% locked for 30 years isn't terrible anyway.  You'll save monthly with a refi but there will be a nice chunk of fees up front to pay for the loan.    If you make good money, then just save up so you can put some money down on the new loan.  That'll also make the loan total smaller, allowing you to get a 15 year am and pay that sucker off faster.|`|zC60UAyUaa	You're between a rock and a hard place.

s8Wwk7H7aa	I am an eBay seller also and I have this problem too.  It is mainly because the buyers don't bother to read the whole listing, including the return policy. I do offer refunds within 30 days and clearly state this in my descriptions, but you would be surprised how many people try to return something after 30 days.  Such an annoyance.    All you can do is continue to describe your items and your return policy as accurately as possible (in big bold letters if necessary).  If you do have complaints, simply send a link of the listing to the complainer and that will usually nip it in the bud.  If they try to leave a negative feedback rating, you can usually dispute it with eBay based on your item description.    It just comes with the territory.|`|f96fc627f519f3ac55a4b380b5d54678aa	If you are selling for profit (ie a business) then purchasers have a legal right to cancel under the Distance Selling Regs 2000; in any case you can not force anyone to buy anything unfortunately and as ebay has taken away all feedback power from sellers the buyer is firmly in control.      We have several ebay businesses and list everything on Buy it Now and with Paypal only, therefore no one can buy and not pay us.  We used to have serious problems with buyers 'buying' goods and then not paying for them - some of the excuses were laughable, but very annoying!

Even then, they'll still be blaming their problems on other people. They'll say the reason they're poor is because minimum wage isn't high enough and they'll say their evictions are the landlord's fault because its unreasonable to expect rent payments when there are cigarettes to be bought.

5222054505f7e9d4aca03f4bfa18d0b2aa	No, self help methods of eviction are illegal. Only a judge has the power to evict someone. She has to give you proper notice, then take you to court. She'll have to convince the judge to kick you out. And he'll do it his way, not hers.     You also have a legal claim for rent withholding for non-compliance of housing codes. Landlords must keep a rental house in good repair, providing heat, running water, electricity, and security. If this is not done you can, after giving proof of non-compliance to the landlord, immediately terminate the lease, withhold rent, take her to court to recover past rent, find alternate housing until the place is repaired, or any combination of the above.    It is also illegal for her to spend your security deposit. That is YOUR money and is supposed to be held temporarily in a separate bank account. To be returned to you after you move out, provided you leave the place clean and don't owe any bills.     My advice is don't give her any more money and let her try to evict you. Take pictures and get a professional estimate for repairs. Give copies of both to the LL. She'll have a hard time making a case against you. By then you'll probably have move on anyway. If she changes the locks or enters the apt for any reason other than repair, call the police and she can argue with them. They'll set her strait. To really make her mad, take her to small claims for your security deposit and all rent paid after the heater broke. She'll be having fits.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Google landlord tenant laws in you state.  If you are month to month, they you are probably required to give a 30 day notice.  She cannot tell you to be out in 72 hours!  She has to go through the eviction process.  You would be better to pay the full month's rent.  I think your bigger issue is the fact your new won't be vacated on time.  You had better contact your new landlord and get assurance the until will be ready for you.    realtor.sailor|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	No.    The landlord has to go to court to evict you...no matter what the reason.    If she tries to change the locks, call the police dept. They will explain to her the procedure for eviction and will inform her that either she has to give you a key immediately or face arrest.    You cannot throw someone out on the street..lease or no lease.|`|c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	First of all, she isn't allowed to spend your deposit, as you are entitled to some or all of that money back at the end of your lease unless she can prove you damaged the property in some way (sounds like there wasn't much left to damage). Legally, she can refuse to use the deposit money towards your rent payment and require you to pay her the rent separately, but then she has to provide receipts/explanation as to why she is not returning your deposit.  Either way, she cannot kick you out without eviction proceedings.   I would just tell her to either do what you asked with the deposit or you will take her to court for violating her part of the agreement by never fixing anything. She would probably not only end up owing you your whole deposit back, but you could also ask for part of your rent back for the months you went without heat/hot water.(look up the landlord-tenant act in your area to see what your rights are).  Good Luck.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	wow;  what a confusing story and situation for you!    To get maintenance done on your unit--now or future;  [this is on associated content.com too]  give LL 30 days unless it is a critical, life threatening situation.  in those cases, they just correct immediately or you may leave  under a constructive eviction Component of law.    otherwise, find a licensed contractor after 30 day wait and  hire and pay him.  Make sure all is to your satisfaction.    take that out of the next mo rent [send a copy of the paid invoice]    re GET OUT; in the US  under no circumstances can any LL get a tenant out without  a court order and that takes a min of 15 days.    Get back to me For any more help|`|ak3NBmINaa	Sounds like you have a landlord from hell. Don't leave until you are ready--she has no authority to kick you out like that.    Also, you must learn how to turn up the heat on a deadbeat landlord like this woman. Try this link on for size:    http://www.caltenantlaw.com/Habitability...    Now, that's California law, and you should compare it to your state's law. Google it up.    There is one more concept you must learn about: retaliation. A landlord is not allowed to abuse her position and take action that can be viewed as retaliation. That 72-hour notice sounds exactly like retaliation, and you might seek your local tenant rights organization (oh, yes, there's one in almost every community).|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	No absolutely she cannot. she has to go through the courts and she has to show cause. And with your evidence of the living conditions she would have no case whatsoever. Having said that, she could make it very unpleasant if you stay past the 72 hours, you'd have to get the police involved and the whole thing could really escalate.  you should never have put up with these conditions as long as you did.|`|pCEA7Pu8aa	No. She can not kick you out like that.  It is actually a huge process through the courts and there is really nothing she can do.  As the renter you actually have all of the power.    Even if you stopped paying her it would still take her 4-6 weeks and a couple of hundred dollars to get you out.    It sounds like she is probably going through foreclosure put you in to collect rent and not give it to the bank.    Now the house is probably being sold at the courthouse and she is trying to get you out and cut her losses.    Good Luck.|`|72ac3eb21624d734920224a5e1b893e7aa	She has started the eviction process.   She has to give you the 3 day notice before she can file the law suit for non-payment.   You do have the right to move out within 3 days to avoid the eviction.   But it sounds like you would prefer to be evicted.    Be prepared to prove that you had  no heat and no hot water and that she was aware of that.   It can not be because you did not fill the propane tank though, she is not required to pay for your heat and hot water, just provide a source for you to obtain each.
AA11284831	If you only lived with her for 4 months, she can ONLY claim you if you earned LESS than $3,500 in 2008 AND she can prove that she provided more than half of your support for the ENTIRE year.    Assuming that you earned more than $3,500, she can NOT claim you.  The only thing that you will need to prove is that you earned $3,500 or more.  Your tax return will stand as proof of that all by itself.  Go ahead and claim your personal exemption.  She will lose on this one.    It's NOT a matter of choosing "family battles" worth fighting.

Good luck!|`|oHMQXzwLaa	Which ever company you choose, here are a few guidelines...    Assuming you are in the US... http://www.falkosgold.co.uk have a live gold price chart. This will tell you the exact current market value of Gold in US dollars. You can also change for different currencies if you wish.    E.g. Gold is currently at $906 per troy ounce.  This means that PURE gold is worth 906 / 31.1 = $29 per gram.    If your gold is 9 carat, you take $29, divide by 24 then multiply by 9.    If your gold is 18 carat... You take $29, divide by 24 then multiply by 18.    Assuming 9ct (as most of our gold is 9ct in the UK), your gold's MARKET value is $10.87 per gram ($29/24*9). You will never get 100% of this, and only a few companies offer within 90% of this value. You should never sell for less than 80% of this value. e.g. at time of writing, do not consider less than $8.70 per gram.    If any company is offering you any less, then they are making a MASSIVE profit of over $2 per gram that you sell to them.    Hope this helps...    Good luck gold selling!|`|krloGYqYaa	I personally tried cash 4 gold got $200 for 2 rings that i sent it I well got worth what i paid for them Highly recommend cash 4 gold

I have called the IRS and spoke to 5 different agents and got 5 different responses. I called last week and an agent said i would have mine deposited on the 30th. The last one said that the "system" generates the deposit dates and there is no way of telling. The "system" updates once a week and the new information should be available NEXT Monday. They can not manually over ride the "system". It takes 3 weeks to process so they will not investigate further until the 3 weeks are up. Also she said that the ads for 8-15 days refund are false advertisement.... YES, that is what the IRS agent said. this is the first year i have efiled. i always use H&R Block and get mine back the same day! Efiling was so much cheaper. I did find out that H&R Block customers were having the same issues so this is all with the IRS, not the preparers. not everyone is having trouble. I think a few folks actually received their refunds on time.  Good luck.|`|5ocZVuaCaa	IRS refunds are issued on Fridays.

Hopefully if yours says the 10th it will be direct deposited to your account by the 6th. Of course if you are recieving a check it is longer wait time.  Good luck. I am waiting as well for my refund as my date has been changed form Feb 3 to Feb 10|`|znr8SBiWaa	There were glitches. The IRS isn't saying what they are.  Rumor has it that it's because of people entering an amount on line 70 when they shouldn't have, but I'm one of the ones delayed, and I didn't enter an amount on line 70, just 0.    Hopefully, it'll be there this Friday.

Note: This is income tax so you only get the credit if it is a cost of earning income.  This means that if you didn't have the child care you wouldn't be able to hold a job.|`|AA10469473	Mothers Day Out?  You can only claim child care that's so you can WORK, not just to get a break for yourself.  So if the program follows the name, it's not an eligible expense like regular daycare so you can work would be.
YQ1Q7XeEaa	It depends on what you mean by disrespected.    If they are making racist or sexist jokes or comments that is a serious offense.    If they simply don't like you then they may only be being rude.  Not nice but no law against that.    The simple truth about respect is you have to earn it.  You won't get along with everyone - you can't control them only you.    Do a good job and they will back off.|`|8c56135cd4589e0631905a4f324f3f20aa	I would suck it up and just take it.      It's going to happen.      And be happy you have a job!|`|WgT5l14baa	You have a right to be paid.  If you get respect that's a bonus.|`|DBdR26Ssaa	well you only have two choices. you can quit. or you can stay, and take it the best you can. you do your job to the best of your abiltiy and no one should have reason to pick on you.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	You need to ask yourself why you are really feeling disrespected.  Are you doing your job correctly and well? Do you have patterns of absences and being late? If you were your supervisor, would you hire someone like you? You need to assess your abilities and how well you think you are really doing.   It is not possible to have a boss or supervisor who likes you all the time. They should respect you, sure, but a lot of it depends on how much respect for your job and your supervisors you have.  As far as the laughing around, as you say, are you approachable or aloof?   Lastly, there will be times in your life where you do not get along with co-workers or supervisors, but the bottom line is, you are not there to make friends, you are there to do a job, and do it well. It makes it easier when you feel comforatble at your job, but it is not necessary.   If you really feel that strongly about it, you should look for another job before you quit the one you have, A lot of people can't find a job.|`|3urQfMffaa	be happy that you HAVE a job and the dough is coming in.

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Nicole, you left out some important details.<br>  <br>  WHY are you being evicted?   You say you have always been on time with rent, so it is not for that.  "Notice to cure" implies you have broken the lease, but you have not stated here in what way you broke the lease.    You did not submit the fraudulent papers to the landlord (which would have been a Federal crime, BTW), so that is not it either.   If you never gave them to the landlord you did not break the lease, there is no need for the NCO to go to court and state that he told you two to commit a felony.<br>  <br>  You did not state what "thats why we waited so long " means.   Waited for what?   Why are you being sued at all?   A law suit has to have a loss to be filed.   The landlord is claiming you owe him money for something.   usually it is rent (you will lose big time if it is rent), but you have stated you have never even been late with it.<br>  <br>  The military clause is not going to apply to you, have you have not been relacted by the military, your spouse is at the same base.   The clause is federal law, no loop holes, it does not even have to be in the lease.|`|RZzMse3Haa	There is a lot that sounds really wrong here, but it is hard to answer with out more info.<br>  <br>  What date did you move out?  Did the landlord know? When was your lease supposed to be up?  Did you make sure they had your forwarding address?|`|vHB9zUcCaa	if I were U I'd find me a really good atty who specializes in this kinda thing|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	It comes down to 'did the landlord loose money because of the lease' What kind of shape did you leave it in, how long till he found a new tenant, did you pay for all the time that you were occupying it? In real estate law its all about what is in writing. And don't mention any attempt to show 'fake' orders.good luck|`|vTuCXN7Faa	You reap what you sow. How is it your being evicted after you said you moved ? Did you forget to inform your landlord ? Did you give him notice that you were exercising the clause ?This smacks of deception. In the lease you signed, did it state  you didn't have to inform him if you were to move? If not you should have. He needed to inspect the premises, he needed time to find new tenants. Your attitude suggests to me anyway, you abused this situation by not informing your landlord. I find you guilty. Pay up
