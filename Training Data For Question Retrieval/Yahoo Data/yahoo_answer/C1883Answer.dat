Mergers and buy outs tend to keep the IS at corporate and let go most of the IT at the facility. Also, many companies are finding it cheaper to out source networking than to pay a high salary and benefits. I think it's a good career, but you may have to relocate to get what you want.

Written in 1982 by Rich Skrenta, it attached itself to the Apple DOS 3.3 operating system and spread by floppy disk. This virus was originally a joke, created by the high school student and put onto a game. The game was set to play, but release the virus on the 50th time of starting the game. Only this time, instead of playing the game, it would change to a blank screen that read a poem about the virus named Elk Cloner. The computer would then be infected.<br>  <br>  The first PC virus was a boot sector virus called (c)Brain, created in 1986 by two brothers, Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi, operating out of Lahore, Pakistan. The brothers reportedly created the virus to deter pirated copies of software they had written. However, analysts have claimed that the Ashar virus, a variant of Brain, possibly predated it based on code within the virus.<br>  <br>  Before computer networks became widespread, most viruses spread on removable media, particularly floppy disks. In the early days of personal computers, many users regularly exchanged information and programs on floppies. Some viruses spread by infecting programs stored on these disks, while others installed themselves into the disk boot sector, ensuring that they would be run when the user booted the computer from the disk.<br>  <br>  Traditional computer viruses emerged in the 1980s, driven by the spread of personal computers and the resultant increase in bulletin board system and modem use, and software sharing. Bulletin board driven software sharing contributed directly to the spread of Trojan horse programs, and viruses were written to infect popularly traded software. Shareware and bootleg software were equally common vectors for viruses on BBS's. Within the "pirate scene" of hobbyists trading illicit copies of commercial software, traders in a hurry to obtain the latest applications and games were easy targets for viruses.<br>  <br>  Since the mid-1990s, macro viruses have become common. Most of these viruses are written in the scripting languages for Microsoft programs such as Word and Excel. These viruses spread in Microsoft Office by infecting documents and spreadsheets. Since Word and Excel were also available for Mac OS, most of these viruses were able to spread on Macintosh computers as well. Most of these viruses did not have the ability to send infected e-mail. Those viruses which did spread through e-mail took advantage of the Microsoft Outlook COM interface.<br>  <br>  Macro viruses pose unique problems for detection software. For example, some versions of Microsoft Word caused macros to replicate themselves with additional blank lines. The virus behaved identically but would be misidentified as a new virus. In another example, if two macro viruses simultaneously infect a document, the combination of the two, if also self-replicating, can appear as a "mating" of the two and would likely be detected as a virus unique from the "parents".[2]<br>  <br>  A computer virus may also be transmitted through instant messaging. A virus may send a web address link as an instant message to all the contacts on an infected machine. If the recipient, thinking the link is from a friend (a trusted source) and follows the link to the website, the virus hosted at the site may be able to infect this new computer and continue propagating<br>  <br>  see<br>  <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/virus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.howstuffworks.com/virus.htm</a>|`|AA10889265	this may help<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.onlinecomputertips.com/virus/virus_spyware.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinecomputertips.com/virus/...</a>|`|1bc56e1c03aac5aaa10d3260ab16b802aa	blork|`|4bcbbbcf43a09d6fb6912272ccb9f96baa	Last virus been about mobiles, u can read more about it on <a href="http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single7138" rel="nofollow">http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news...</a>|`|f6f123d1de5cfc1006bad11b8d6e757aaa	ur mom.|`|AA10804404	I do not know if it is new but i got one the other day on myspace called X Password Generator, It wiped out automatic updates, my sound card, and defaults.It kept putting pop us on my desk top saying i had Virus and the only way to get rid of it was to wipe PC clean and redo system, I tried Mcafee,Norton,AVG, every kind of scan i could do i did it and nothing picked it up.

META tags should be placed between the <HEAD> and </HEAD> tags of your document. The most common META tags are going to look like this: <br>  <br>  <HEAD> <br>  <TITLE>META examples</TITLE> <br>  <META name=" " content=" "> <br>  </HEAD> <br>  <br>  The name=" " will indicate what type of meta tag you are using. The content=" " will be the content of the tag you provide for the search engine. To make more sense of this, lets look at the META "keywords" tag. <br>  <br>  <META name="keywords" content="meta tags, search, homepage, web sites"> <br>  <br>  name="keywords"<br>  informs the search engine's spider that a group of keywords should be in this tag. <br>  <br>  content="meta tags, search, homepage, web sites"<br>  is your list of keywords and key phrases. In the "keywords" tag, you separate each keyword or key phrase by placing a comma between them. <br>  <br>  Be careful not to repeat the same thing too many times here, and be sure the keywords are relevant to the content on your page. The Search Engines are attempting to crack down on people who use these tags to repeat the same word over and over in order to get a better listing, or using keywords that have nothing to do with the content of the page.

This would be done by making a javascript command that would get the current element in the dropdown list and then submitting it as a url, example:<br>  parent.frames[0].location.href=url;<br>  so to get url you would use something like:<br>  parent.location.href = document.forms[0].options[list.selectedI...<br>  you would use settimeout javascript command to load a new value adding to the index every time:<br>  document.forms[0].elements[0].selected...<br>  <br>  1) Run the master function to start the timer (settimeout)<br>  2) After so many seconds you set it loads first page eg. 10 seconds<br>  3) I would start out with a value of selected index that would be 0 and then keep increasing it with a call to another function every 10 seconds offset by 5 seconds to change the value between page loads.<br>  4) Then the function would repeat calling it again to load the next page. From the form dropbox.<br>  <br>  Give this a try. You will have to mess around to get the effect you want.

Can't tell you about passing the regular proxies because I don't know your settings and browser. Although putting the website as a safe entry in IE6 or 7 is not going to display the website. You have to connect directly to the server and not put proxy settings. I'm assuming that Etisalat is your provider. It's not easy unless you have your own server or are connecting around them. Sorry.

839d5b8e572f91181004336e772d2678aa	In torrents, Seeders are those who have a completed download and are uploading to the Leechers. Since they have the download completed, they don't download anymore. Leechers are uploading and downloading at the same time, but most of the time they are downloading faster than they upload.<br>  <br>  If you are on a torrent with more Seeders than Leechers, the download time will often be very fast. If you are on a torrent with more Leechers than Seeders, times may vary according to the ratios for upload and download that you use, and the bandwidth provided by your ISP.<br>  <br>  In some rare cases there will be 0 Seeders, in which case it is not likely you will ever get the file, because no one has the full thing completely downloaded. These are considered dead torrents.|`|9b06fba7685580e8d1b638ca208840f3aa	If I'm not mistaken, a seed is a person who is sharing the file, a leecher is a person downloading the file.|`|76fbe986943a1bfc7ebf60ccfd5b574daa	In any case, the more seeds and less leechers of the files you want to download, the fastest the download.

Another hint is to look at your task bar when you start your windows. All those icons are programs that are running now. By default programs like Real Player, Quicktime, Messenger, and any programs that you download and installed without unchecking the load with Windows button will do just that.

Both ASP and ASP.NET allow a Web site builder to dynamically build Web pages on the fly by inserting queries to a relational database in the Web page. ASP.NET is different than its predecessor in two major ways: it supports code written in compiled languages such as Visual Basic, C++, C#, and Perl, and it features server controls that can separate the code from the content, allowing WYSIWYG editing of pages. Although ASP.NET is not backwards compatible with ASP, it is able to run side by side with ASP applications. ASP.NET files can be recognized by their .aspx extension.

AA10947750	"The QWERTY keyboard layout was devised and created in the 1860s by the creator of the first modern typewriter, Christopher Sholes, a newspaper editor who lived in Milwaukee. Originally, the characters on the typewriters he invented were arranged alphabetically, set on the end of a metal bar which struck the paper when its key was pressed. However, once an operator had learned to type at speed, the bars attached to letters that lay close together on the keyboard became entangled with one another, forcing the typist to manually unstick the typebars, and also frequently blotting the document.[1] A business associate of Sholes, James Densmore, suggested splitting up keys for letters commonly used together to speed up typing by preventing common pairs of typebars from striking the platen at the same time and sticking together. The effect this rearrangement of letters had on maximum typing speed is a disputed issue. Some sources assert that the QWERTY layout was designed to slow down typing speed to further reduce jamming.[2] [3] Other sources assert the rearrangement worked by separating common sequences of letters in English.[citation needed] Ostensibly, the hammers that were likely to be used in quick succession were less likely to interfere with each other.[3]"<br>  <br>  Source: Wikipedia.|`|IKZO1oWXaa	this is actually a layout that was developed when they had typewriters,  it was designed for innefficienciy..   they key were laid out this way so that the metal strike bars of the type writer would not cross eachother and get stuck, and to make the typing process slower for the same reason.   <br>  I

I know on dells and toshiba laptops, you plug the cord up to the laptop to the tv, set the tv up so it will display what's plugged into it, usually a button on the tv or the remote that says either input, aux, or game, then go to the laptop and hit the function button and f5 to change the display to the external tv. that toggles thru three video modes, the laptop's screen, the laptop's vga plug, which you aren't using, and the laptops television output. another way to do this is right click on your desktop, select properties, click on the settings tab, then the advanced button. from there every machine is different, but there should be something in there somewhere to make it start displaying on the tv.|`|IKZO1oWXaa	Hook up the cable to both sides,  TV and Laptop,   Right click on your Desktop,  Goto properties on your drop down menue,    On the Display Properties windows that opened up goto the settings tab (Should be last tab)   And click the advanced button near the bottom.   Now look trough the tabs on this new window that opens after you hit advanced.   It depends on what video card you have in the laptop but there should be a tab   with something to the effect of Inte Display,  Nvidia, ATI    ext........   Goto this tab and find the dislay out put settings      and  there will be a drop down menu or a radial button somewhere that will let you eihter, Clone, Extend, of just plain switch monitor,.

AA11071085	I didn't know that the motherboard had USB sockets, infact I am pretty sure they don't. You may be looking at something else or not talking about the motherboard.|`|IKZO1oWXaa	unfortunately there is no straight answer for this. Every motherboard is different. BUT.... Most of them are in the same general area.   First thing about a motherboard and putting a connector on it is that if it doesn't fit, it doesn't go there,  If you have 6 pins and 6 holes, most likely that is where it is suppose to go.     Generally the external usb ports plug into a little rectangle connector.  If you place the computer on its side and face the port on the back towards your stomach, so the CD ROM on the from you.   The ports will be on the right hand side along the edge of the motherboard.  sometimes they are along the back edge (closest to the front of the case)  I am finding this hard to explain, thought i could do a better job than this, but i hope it helps anyway. <br>  sorry if this is confusing.   just finding it hard to explain where they usually are.
OTwM4uOzaa	kk.well i think INTEL will be beter.yeah, dual core.the dfferene between t7250 and t 7300 are not to many.they have the same power(MHz) but t7300 is newer than the othen and it also has a higher FSB.another thing is that 7300 uses a soket P ,other than 7250 wich works on soketM.7250 has it's multiplyer higher than 7300 wich make's it less fiable.So i advice you to chose the t7300:D and u sould lok at something like +1Gb Ram ,good HDD and as for video card, you can manage on al 128Mb ,or an onboard videocard if u reached your budget and if also u have a good processor and good RAM:Dhope u will find it,he's waiting for ya;)|`|gWJdCtaFaa	I run a dual core AMD at 2.4 ghz.

Clogged fans spin slower, cool less efficiently and must work harder to keep temperatures in the safe (non-crash) zone.<br>  <br>  If you're starting to see artifacts and off-colored pixels, that's usually an indication the card has suffered heat damage.

Letters were strategically placed so that you would alternate letters from different areas of the keyboard thereby preventing key jams. If you have ever used a manual typewriter, you understand what this means.<br>  <br>  A modern variant is the DVORAK keyboard that was designed with typing efficiency and speed in mind. You can get PC software to convert your keyboard. Learning to type on DVORAK requires dedication and practice.
UQjUpqG3aa	no the on board memory of a graphics card is totally independent of the main memory and doesn't need to match the main memory at all it's the graphics card that supports it's on board memory not the computer <br>  the memory on a graphics card is very often the fastest available for performance|`|CsIvy5MAaa	Doesn't matter. Video card is a separate device that works independently from the rest of the computer (for the most part), so its memory can be different.|`|AA12271834	Your graphics card is completely separate from your motherboard and as such they don't share resources.  The RAM on a graphics card is meant for the GPU (the CPU or brain of your graphics card).  The more RAM it has the faster it will be (within the limit of the GPU).  You just have to check the computer's motherboard to see what type of RAM it takes and buy accordingly.|`|53sVKcOeaa	The video card adds more memory the RAM is simple the add-on memory (although required), aslong as it fits in the motherboard it will work with any RAM, Graphics Card or Processor.|`|v6fQWSy2aa	graphics card is an individual hardware. it don't relate to computer memory. u can choose whatever u like.|`|scOcY1tMaa	No.<br>  <br>  It does have to be the same clock speed and type.<br>  <br>  DDR2 not DDR3<br>  <br>  Clock speed in Megahertz or Gigahertz. (CPU).|`|F9S78wRkaa	A graphics card is nominally independent from the motherboard's (MB) memory--but there IS a catch.<br>  <br>  As graphics-card memory edges above 256 MB, there is an overlap between the card's RAM and the MB RAM in the CPU's memory space.  Windows has a ~3.2 GB RAM limit, no natter how much you put in--a graphics card with 512 MB of RAM will reduce that limit by some am0unt.  This is not usually a problem, but it's good to be aware.  Your motherboard's manufacturer's website (or your manual, which you can download as a PDF) can give you more detail.<br>  <br>  Since the graphics processor unit (GPU) is separate from the main PC processor (CPU), the memory does NOT have to be the same.  This is what allows a GPU to be overclocked independently of the CPU--you can overclock either, both, or neither.  Some graphics boards overclock the GPU and/or RAM by default.<br>  <br>  You can also find more on this at the following sites:<br>  <a href="http://www.HardOCP.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.HardOCP.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.Guru3D.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Guru3D.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.TomsHardware.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.TomsHardware.com</a><br>  <br>  Once you install the new graphics card, a good place to download the most up-to-date drivers is:<br>  <a href="http://Download.Guru3D.com" rel="nofollow">http://Download.Guru3D.com</a><br>  Of all types of cards, graphics cards benefit the MOST from updated drivers because of their processing power and complexity.<br>  <br>  ~~ ScienceMikey<br>  My home page: <a href="http://MRudas.2Ya.com" rel="nofollow">http://MRudas.2Ya.com</a><br>  My software blog: <a href="http://FaveSoft.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://FaveSoft.blogspot.com</a><br>  My Protopage links: <a href="http://TinyURL.com/3wt54n" rel="nofollow">http://TinyURL.com/3wt54n</a>

0HQj5wnVaa	Start the Recovery Console and it should fix the problem or do a installation repair wihout loss of data. Pc is not maintenance-free devices. It’s not as simple as just power them up and go. Every pc, over time, will require routine maintenance to optimize pc performance and to avoid registry processing errors.<br>  <br>  The registry is a directory of system settings and options. As modifications are made to the pc configuration in the framework of hardware and software additions or upgrades, the registry is altered. Sometimes these alterations may clash with the current system.<br>  <br>  As time goes by, registry changes accumulate. There is significant risk of incompatibilities between the file processing. These issues translate into performance drawback that typically explodes overtime. To avoid the damage, it is necessary to cleanup registry file.<br>  <br>  Manual repair and maintenance of the registry is an extremely complex task that only the most technically inclined should take on or you run the risk of losing critical data and personal information or even worse end up with a computer that doesn't work at all. With the proper software, however, registry repair becomes a relatively stress free task that will improve your PC's performance without going round the twist and losing one's mind.<br>  <br>  Symptoms a pc registry repair is needed<br>  <br>  Performance issues that indicate the need for pc registry repair typically worsen and become more frequent over time. Once a registry repair is applied, however, there is a noticeable improvement in performance.<br>  <br>  Common issues that indicate a need for windows registry repair include (but are not limited to):<br>  <br>  You are having slow computer problems.<br>  Windows setting change unexpectedly.<br>  Shut down is slow and usually with error message.<br>  Anti-virus and spyware software didn't repair the issues.<br>  There are crashes and continuous computer freezes.<br>  The computer starts slow.<br>  Rebooting the computer is becoming a consistent problem.<br>  Errors specifically pinpoint a problem.<br>  There is an inability to properly add and remove software on PC.<br>  There is the "Blue Screen of Death.".<br>  The computer is experiencing lengthened response times.<br>  Computer internet is slow.<br>  Program launches are delayed.<br>  <br>  If you are experiencing a good portion of the problems above, there is definitely the need for an XP registry repair.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	Sounds like a major Malware infection.

You'll need to back up your data first get an external hard drive if you don't have one. But first and for most scan your files before you do anything chances are they may have trojans/spyware hidden.<br>  <br>  try these programs spyhunter, superantispyware and trojan remover.<br>  and if you don't have a good antivirus program get a copy of Kaspersky one of the best ones out there.<br>  <br>  hope that helps.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|rBKcAjRCaa	Don't worry. I can definitely understand your situation. I think that this problem can be resolved with the help of 'Windows Recovery Console'. You don't need installation disks.

They don't slow your computer down like other programs.<br>  The first is M-bam "Malwarebytes"It's an on demand scanner with a really cool tool called file assassin.You can use this tool to delete rogue programs that freeze up your computer and keeps you from downloading and using security programs!<br>  The second is "Superantispyware" It's another on demand scanner that catches what M-bam misses!<br>  Third is "Avira" It's an on demand scanner and firewall "although they call it AntiVirGuard" I use this as my primary security.I have it setup to do updates and scans at night when I'm sleeping so when I go on my computer in the morning it's there waiting for me to review all the bugs I caught the day before! "Note"Until you get your computer clean I would disable the AntiVirGuard It's a little sensitive and can drive you crazy with popups saying your computer is infected.<br>  I found a very good video by Matt Rizos that explains the whole prosess in detail so get out the popcorn and watch this video!<br>  Video:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ah3efRdWes&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ah3efRdW...</a><br>  Downloads:<br>  1.<a href="http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&subj=dl&tag=button" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant...</a><br>  2.<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/superantispywarefreevspro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/superant...</a><br>  3.<a href="http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Personal-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10322935.html?part=dl-10322935&subj=dl&tag=button&cdlPid=10986298" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe...</a><br>  Now that your computer is clean download CC-cleaner and run the cleaner.<br>  <a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_ccleaner/" rel="nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_cclean...</a><br>   Click the tool icon and uninstall any unused programs "If your not sure about a program leave it alone because once it's gone it's gone!"Next click Startup button" and go through the list and disable everything except ctfmon.exe and avgnt Don't worry if something doesn't work right you can always go back and enable them latter!

GKar86j8aa	hi there<br>  <br>  ubuntu has a huge user base just because of the fact that it is lightweight. it is based on the principle that if you need something install then, which is totally different to other distro such as red hat enterprise or fedora project which comes with 3.5 gig of installer.<br>  Ubuntu whereas is try before you install concept. you can run ubuntu from a CD. if you like it then only you install it. Fedora 10 has made things in this way now. <br>  <br>  me too is interested to see if ubuntu can hold its position in front of fedora project.|`|VbP8YWonaa	Gee, I really don't know why. Many of the distributions out there use Debian and Ubuntu repositories in their file systems. I have used Mint Linux and like the desktop environment. I've even used Debian's net installer and liked it also. Ubuntu seems to disable and drop repositories after six months and this is bad for people who like what they have. The biggest issues I have is the ability to use wireless on my laptops. The support is limited.<br>  <br>  I guess 200 Linux LiveCDs in my closet means I don't like Linux.
WNgFewmtaa	It is claimed that with 2.0, you can customize more. Not true! You can move sections/modules around but that's about the end of customizing.<br>  <br>  Alot of sites have some good 2.0 layouts but I like the selection of 1.0 better.<br>  <br>  And 2.0 has 'bugs' when it come to apps. Tom says they are working them out but IDK if I'd trust a 2.0 just yet.<br>  <br>  You can change to 2.0 from your edit profile screen but I would wait a little longer to do so. If you do change, I believe you have 60 days to try it out but after that, you're pretty much stuck with it.|`|21R4oEXFaa	On Myspace, go to Customize profile, click "Upgrade to Profile 2.0"<br>  The 2.0 version is cool, but I personally like 1.0, plus you can always change back to 1.0 if you don't like the look of 2.0.

Once an item has a little lock on it, it's in your inventory, no getting rid of them. I believe locked zOMG items can be sold back to the zOMG store for 1g, but that's about all you can do.
6uCZvGoUaa	The best think to do is download a program that manages downloads, like "GetRight" (<a href="http://www.getright.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.getright.com/)</a><br>  <br>  Thats the best way, if the computer freezes or the internet goes down, the program will began the download where it stops. I hope this helps|`|RXA3ZQH2aa	To resume a download from the server you are downloading it from must support resuming. For example if you are downloading a large file from Rapidshare as free access and your download stops midway you can not resume download from where it stopped and you have to start it from scratch. In case the sever supports resuming, you can continue to download after any unwanted obstructions. Download managers do excellent jobs in this respect. I would recommend Free Download Manager to help your downloads (it is fast and supports resuming whenever possible) The sites that do support resuming also allows you to pause an ongoing download and resume later. In your case I think the server does not support resuming hence your problem. I would suggest you to find torrent of the files if available and download them via p2p using utorrent. Hopefully this will solve your problem.

Creation of an image to communicate an idea presupposes the use of a visual language. Just as people can 'verbalize' their thinking, they can 'visualize' it. The elements in an image represent concepts in a spatial context, rather than the linear form used for words. Speech and visual communication are parallel and usually interdependent means by which humans exchange information. A diagram, a map, and a painting are all examples of the use of the visual language. Its structural units include line, shape, color, motion, texture, pattern, direction, orientation, scale, angle, space and proportion.<br>  <br>  <br>

You are probably ok if you left the site right away because there isn't anyone watching you from some remote computer, and saying little Johnny typed in a bad word and almost went to a porn site for 5 seconds.

I can say this: I have set up Internet filtering at a school, and what you got came from the filter. It was saying why it rejected the request for that site.<br>  <br>  You can listen to others, but in the end, the best thing is not to lie. They can track who did it and when down to the millisecond. I don't agree with zero tolerance, but if that is the policy where you are, then no lie you can tell is going to get you off. It didn't just "pop onto the screen". That doesn't happen. Web sits will get catagorized as Porn even if they link to a porn site, so you can't use the "I clicked on something and didn't know what it was" excuse. That can be verified as well.<br>  <br>  Take your own advice. Don't make a joke about it. Don't go volunteer the information because they may have to act based on some zero tolerance directive. But don't lie if they do confront you. You can't win that argument. Those filters are there to protect you, whether you realize it or not. So don't play games with it.|`|2ARIQxCBaa	Oh wow. That's a tough situation.<br>  I don't think they will suspend you, as long as you didn't look into the site farther. As far as excuses go, you can say you were trying to type something else.

dr5UQlyuaa	The term video (from Latin: "I see") commonly refers to several storage formats for moving eye pictures: digital video formats, including DVD, QuickTime, and MPEG-4; and analog videotapes, including VHS and Betamax. Video can be recorded and transmitted in various physical media: in magnetic tape when recorded as PAL or NTSC electric signals by video cameras, or in MPEG-4 or DV digital media when recorded by digital cameras.<br>  <br>  Quality of video essentially depends on the capturing method and storage used. Digital television (DTV) is a relatively recent format with higher quality than earlier television formats and has become a standard for television video. <br>  <br>  3D-video, digital video in three dimensions, premiered at the end of 20th century. Six or eight cameras with realtime depth measurement are typically used to capture 3D-video streams. The format of 3D-video is fixed in MPEG-4 Part 16 Animation Framework eXtension (AFX).

1IaWOdALaa	First off, it looks like your expression is fully parenthesized.  If that's the case, we don't have to worry about operator precedence (the old "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally").  Also, I am assuming there's no whitespace.  I'll let you figure out how to scan over whitespace.<br>  <br>  To build an infix expression tree, we will build the tree in-order using a recursive algorithm.  Let's say the expression is stored in an array called Expr, which has length Expr.length and can be queried using Expr[0]...Expr[length-1] (as in Java).  For simplicity, the expression Expr[x ... y] will return a substring starting at index x and ending at index y (inclusive).<br>  <br>  We'll also define a datatype for a tree.  You can either have a Number(n) or a Node(left, op, right).  Comments are denoted using /* */.<br>  <br>  The Parse function will take a string as input.  We will then parse the first expression in the string.  Then, as output, we will return not just the tree that represents the expression, but the length of the expression.  This is because the length of the expression is discovered as a byproduct of parsing it.  If we had a separate function to find length, it would be doing much the same work as the parse function.  So the return will be of type Pair(Tree, int)<br>  <br>  function Parse(Expr)<br>  /* If expression starts with a digit, then it's a digit */<br>  if (isDigit(Expr[0])<br>  /* Scan forward until we find all the consecutive digits (say there are d of them), use a generic string-to-int function to parse it numerically (say as n).  I assume you can code this part... */<br>  return Pair(Number(n), d).<br>  /* If it's not a digit, it must start with a left paren if it's well-formed */<br>    assert(Expr[0] == '(')<br>  /* First, parse the left sub expression */<br>    Pair p1 = Parse(Expr[1 ... Expr.length-1])<br>  /* Next, pull out the operator.  The 1 is for the length of the left paren, the p1.right is the length of the first subexpression. */<br>    Char op =  Expr[1+p1.right]<br>  /* Finally, parse the right sub expression.  The 1+p1.right is as above, the extra +1 is for the op. */<br>    Pair p2 = Parse(Expr[1+p1.right+1 ... Expr.length-1])<br>  /* Now, we will verify that after the right sub expression is a right paren.  The 1+p1.right+1 is as above, the p2.right is for the right subexpression. */<br>    assert(Expr[1+p1.right+1+p2.right] == ')')<br>  /* Finally, we can construct our return value!  The 1+p1.right+1+p2.right is as above, the extra +1 is for the right paren. */<br>    return Pair(Node(p1, op, p2), 1+p1.right+1+p2.right+1);<br>  <br>  You might think there is some magic in here.  Where's the code that actually figures out the length of an expression?  This is the magic of recursion.  We know how to figure out the length of a unit expression - a number.  Then, given that we know how to figure out the length of a subexpression, we can figure out the length of a full expression.  Since every expression is ultimately built out of units, our seemingly circular definition of length is actually not circular, but hierarchical, just like the expression itself.  This is the hallmark of a recursive descent parser.  No backtracking is necessary for this grammar.<br>  <br>  You might also notice that the length expressions can be simplified, but I thought the way I wrote them would be simpler to understand.<br>  <br>  If you want to allow whitespace, your length expressions will be a bit more complicated.  You'll need to 'vacuum up' the whitespace and count that as part of the length of your expression.<br>  <br>  Finally, an important note: I haven't checked the above code as it is pseudocode, but I have written parsing code of this nature before so I believe (and hope!) it will help you get started.

18tl502eaa	Actually Yes and No! Batteries are actually designed with the fact that laptops are left on all the time. The anticipate that. Your main chips are silicone and do not handle heating and cooling to many times very well. Your computer operates best at a constant temp. You need not have the Laptop plugged in all the time because sleep and hibernate modes are there for a reason. Rebooting is necessary sometimes so don't worry if set your power modes right you can set to sleep your computer as needed. The pros and cons go on forever but the important ones are simple. temp, disk drive read times and spin. As well as the most important the CPU! Every time you restart you force your hard drive to spin to read and write. Hard drives have a ratio of errors after x amount of spin times. Restarting and defragging are examples of operations that require great amounts of spin time and rewrites. Raising the chance of a hard drive failure. And again with the temp issue is that your hardware needs a stable and acceptable consistent environment. I leave my PC and laptop on practically all the time. and have never had a problem. They operate beautifully!!  So. Restart as needed. Let your laptop sleep and ask questions like this on PC sites! Google is the best for questions. Just type in your questions and follow the links!|`|oj9XhICFaa	Absolutely not. Your computer has specific timing schedules of important updates and tasks to follow on a normal daily routine. Help your computer run better, and faster by shutting down your  computer once not in use. It only takes a couple minutes to restart, it takes a long hard effort to get it back in normal regular running condition.|`|AA11345773	Why would you want to do that? Generally speaking the answer is No. It could overheat, you could screw up the battery life if you leave it on the mains, you'd have to deactivate all the power saving options and well no, it's just not a good idea.<br>  <br>  If you're hoping to speed up log in/boot up times either upgrade the laptop or perhaps you could leave it in hibernate every now and again (but again this couldn't be done for long periods).|`|837xgMwLaa	If you can use your laptop on mains without the battery in then I would say it's mostly safe, I've got an old laptop I use to download stuff on, it gets left on for long periods with no heat problems, it's a P3 so doesn't generate much heat anyway. I wouldn't leave an expensive laptop on though, unless I knew it was at a stable temperature, and even then I would want to turn it off asap. Only strain what you can afford to lose.|`|xTb8u783aa	you should be turning your laptop off all the time and not just pluging it in it not safe it stop working and you may have to plug it in all the time and thats not good <br>  <br>  so turn your laptop off after use|`|6W7nJYskaa	No I wouldn't call that safe at all.

1EN9ngsbaa	You should try to be really good with tags. I mean, dont just put in "fireworks, explosion" if your video is about fireworks. Try to use all types of things, like "fireworks, Explosion, colorful, pattern, night, time, dark fire, launch, sparks" stuff like that.<br>  <br>  And it would also help to have a great title. Something like "Fourth of July Fireworks" probaly wont rack in alot of views. Something like "Fireworks are pretty..." would probaly get more, but not as many as "I LIGHT THINGS ON FIRE!" Just make sure not to lie to your viewers, but if you really do lit the fireworks off, that would be an appropriate title.<br>  <br>  Another great thing to do it to have a great thumbnail. I disagree throughly with people who put something like a women with her shirt almost off as the thumbnail, because most of the time that has nothing to do with the video. Most of the time they just times it there so it would flash for a second, then continue on with the video. What YOU should do is if your video is about fireworks, and you names it "I LIGHT THINGS ON FIRE!" then maybe the middle frame should be you with a lighter on next to your face. Something to get viewers to go "ot oh, what is that guy going to do?" Just make sure that that lighter part is legitinmetly about your video.<br>  <br>  One of the best things to do is to make your video a response to a very popular video, or to a new video that might not have alot of views yet, but their subscriber count is high. <br>  <br>  For example, if you make a video talking about some bizzare news story, and sXephil, A popular youtuber, mentions the same story in his video, make it a video response to it. With a good thumbnail, it should rack in the viewers. Or if your video is a video about how to do something, like make something, or a trick on the computer, make your video a repsonse to one of householdhacker new video.<br>  <br>  If you do want to have an extra boost in your video veiws, you could use an atuo refrsher. mind you, THIS IS AGAINST THE YOUTUBE RULES. if youtube catches you, you could get suspened or even banned. to download a atuop refresher, click here: <a href="http://www.download.com/AutoRefresher-fo..." rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/AutoRefresher-fo...</a><br>  <br>  There is a quick and easy way to get more channel views though, and this IS legal, it is for now anyways. they might soon change that. but you can download a channel refrsher if you want. to learn more about it, watch this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKwFC_aZk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKwFC_aZk...</a><br>  <br>  It also helps to have external links from youtube. That means having alink to your page, from a different site. If you participate in a forum, you want to include your youtube link in your username. Or maybe in the signature of your e-mail. Everytime you can post it without whoring yourself, DO IT|`|tIDNEwdMaa	You can increase their popularity by increasing their entertainment value.|`|ZTxaaV1Iaa	It usually happens over time. Be patient, you can't expect your videos to become extremely popular in one go. <br>  <br>  Here are some tips to make your videos popular:<br>  <br>  1. Think of a Catchy/Popular Name- Choose something that is like a popular TV show or book series. I've seen videos with the titles ICarly: IMeetFred and they recieved a few hundred views in a hour or two. You can choose something mysterious or strange as well, just something that will come up under popular searches such as 'Vampires'. <br>  <br>  2. Decide Which Age Group Fills Up Most of YouTube's Population- Try doing a bit research on who goes on the Tubes. Look at the front page and see what topic most people look at. You might want to log out and look at what people are viewing at that time. Make a video on a popular topic or something that the main age group would look at.<br>  <br>  3. Advertise: Try mentioning your videos on popular web sites like MySpace (if you have one) and Facebook. You can try sending the link to friends and tell them to send it to their friends to pass the news. Try posting a forum about your videos!<br>  <br>  For more tips, search for videos on making your videos popular. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped a bit!<br>  <br>  -Icy

h0hSIgC1aa	Here are a couple of tried-and-true recommendations:<br>  <br>  - use a PSU calc to gauge your power supply requirements<br>   <a href="http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalcul...</a><br>  <br>  plug in your components it gives you a total wattage, i.e. a typical inspiron 531:  E2200 / 2 x ddr2 / 1 x sata / 1 x dvdrw / 3 x fan / front bay card reader / {gpu to upgrade to} i.e. 8800gt 512M ~= 233W<br>  <br>  Use this wattage in place of the manufacturer recommended power supply, how the heck to they  know what you are going to put their card in???  They have no clue and instead cover their a** by grossly overstating the power requirements.<br>  <br>  - get a power supply by a known reliable manufacturer i.e. FSP/fotron, SPI / sparkle, Seasonic, Corsair, PC Power & Cooling, Antec (TP3/Trio series), etc.<br>  <br>  - for HP / Compaq / Dell / Emachine, etc or other OEM it may be best to stick w/ a rear-firing 80MM unit over a 120MM power supply, depending on the chassis it may interfere with 120mm fan airflow (check your model for free space under the power supply mount).<br>  <br>  - Focus your power supply selection based on the +12v combined power of the PSU over the total wattage of the unit.  If you get a unit that has a +12v combined power to what you need for total wattage from the PSU calc, you are going to guarentee you will not have any problems for years and / or have sufficient capacity for mild upgrades in the future.  Personally I tend to ignore the total wattage of the unit in question the +12v is most important since it is powering the CPU & GPU the most power hungry components (which is part of the ATX v2.x spec<br>  <br>  <br>  These are good choices<br>  <br>  <br>  FSP Group ATX350-PA  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817104901" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  FSP Group FSP400-60PFB  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817104056" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  FSP Group FSP460-60PFB  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817104057" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  SeaSonic SS-350SFE  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151063" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  SeaSonic SS-400ES  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151039" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  SeaSonic SS-500ES  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151040" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  PC Power & Cooling Silencer PPCS370X  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817703018" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  PC Power & Cooling Silencer S41D2 410W  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817703014" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  PC Power & Cooling Silencer PPCS420X 420W  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817703017" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  PC Power & Cooling Silencer (Dell) PPCS500D <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817703016" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>   PC Power & Cooling S61EPS 610W  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817703005" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  well you get the idea, too many good choices to list depending on your requirements<br>  <br>  <br>  cheers<br>  <br>  *EDIT*<br>  <br>  thanks MV, not sure who voted me down, guess they don't like a good answer lol|`|AA11811364	C'mon blitz, if it says you need a 400 w PSU, then why would you think you could get by on less???  Do you want to take a chance on things not running right???<br>  <br>  I had a similar experience with my HP 754V.  I wanted to upgrade the card and I needed a 350 w PSU, mine being only 250 w.  Unfortunately, the HP case and PSU were custom.  The case was designed to use the smaller-scale PSU that came inside.   Therefore, I could not upgrade the PSU without buying another case, which I did.<br>  <br>  I'm much happier with the new standard case I bought from Altex and have since added a few more things inside the case, so the added power supply is not wasted.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|cTPtm1UQaa	I agree w/ desslock I have a similiar unit Seasonic SS-300 in my system E2180 OC'd plus 9600gt it works very well.<br>  <br>  The +12v method is excellent because a lot of PSU manufacturers do not have a high +12v like Seasonic and others he mentioned.<br>  <br>  For example this 9500gt manufacturer power is a bit on the high side:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.galaxytech.com/Product_Details.asp?id=198&class1=1&class2=60" rel="nofollow">http://www.galaxytech.com/Product_Detail...</a><br>  <br>  " * Minimum 400W or greater system power supply (with 12V current rating of 26A)*<br>  <br>  *Minimum system power requirement based on a PC configured with an Intel?

Note: this may require a reboot because it can't check all parts of the disk when the system is active. It only takes about 5 minutes. <br>  <br>  Second, run disk cleanup (Start | Run and enter cleanmgr). That will remove any temp or scrap files.|`|AA12271834	Couple things you should do right off the bat:<br>  * Run Disk Cleanup (Start->Programs->Accessories->System Tools-> Disk Cleanup) and remove all the temporary files, recycle bin files, uninstall files, logs, etc.<br>  * Burn any music, videos, and pictures to DVD/CD for backup storage and only keep the files you use the most (this is always a good idea even if you have lots of space).<br>  * Burn any personal files to a DVD/CD for backup storage and only keep the files you need right now (this is also important to prevent identity theft of your personal documents).  If you plan to modify these documents a lot in the future I would back them up to a USB flashkey or external hard drive instead of DVD/CD.<br>  * Uninstall any programs you no longer use.  If you haven't played a game in 6 months there is a good bet you won't play it again.  If you do want to play it again there is a very small chance you will continue any saved games.<br>  * Uninstall windows programs that YOU KNOW you don't need.  This is done in the add/remove programs located in your Control Panel.  An example of this is I never play the default windows games so I save some space by removing them.<br>  * After removing all this data from your computer you should defrag your computer it will help prevent fragmentation in the newly freed space.|`|5Yu5s2Gyaa	delete old crap that you don't need.  if its on the same hard drive as windows, click on My computer > right click the hard drive > properties > general tab > disk cleanup, and that will list some of the stuff you could probably delete.|`|yMchHj9eaa	run this tool, privacy mantra. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.soft32.com/Download/Free/Privacy_Mantra/4-65926-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.soft32.com/Download/Free/Priv...</a><br>  <br>  Select all and hit clean.

The 4650 should run circles around that old 6200.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to make sure that you've totally uninstalled the old Nvidia drivers.  When going from one company to the other, old drivers tend to muck about with performance and stability.

Some people recommend completely reinstalling windows, as well, to get rid of old drivers, but hopefully you won't need to do that.<br>  <br>  Secondly, make sure to crank up the settings and raise the resolution in your games, to take full advantage of your faster GPU.  The games will look the same if on the same low settings as the old card.....

T8AvZltDaa	If your maximum bid is only 40 thats the most you will pay for the item.  The price will only go up if someone else bids on the item and if the price goes to 41 you wont have to pay anything because you will have lost the auction. If no one else bids then you will win it for 30. so go ahead and place your bid of 40|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	Bid what you would pay for it, if you'd pay up to 40, bid 40<br>  <br>  if no one else bids, you get it at the opening bid=30|`|mZlPj8Guaa	If your maximum price is 40, bid the 40. Just keep it at the maximum price you are willing to pay. If someone outbids you, then he/she overpaid.<br>  <br>  Always set your maximum price. the way E-Bay works is that it will always keep the lowest price into the system. If there is a tie, and you were the first to bid. You will get the item.<br>  <br>  Do not put a bid in that you are not comfortable with.|`|jTN50b5Haa	If you put ￡40 that counts as your maximum bid.<br>  ebay then automatically puts bids in for you up to that price<br>  therefore if you enter ￡40 it would put a bid of ￡30 to start with and only if someone bid against you would it increase.<br>  it would keep increasing (usually 50p or so a time) up to your maximum.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|tmyiEtWhaa	i'm new to ebay aswell, i'd bet like ￡32 if i were you, or you could wait until the auction is close to over and swoop in and bid later so you can get it before anyone else.<br>  <br>  i think you can "watch the product" so you can get back to it later easily.|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	start the bid with 31 then if some one bids just ad one more till he/she goes out of your spending limit that's the only way you can save money and maybe win.|`|MVAc2wVEaa	Bid what you are willing to pay for the item (40), but wait till 15 or 20 seconds before bidding is over to bid.  The EBay computer will bid in increments up to the maximum of 40 for you.  The secret is to wait, so other bidders will have less time to outbid you.<br>  <br>  Synchronize your compute time with your cell phone.|`|ztujP8Oraa	So...you bid ￡40. Then, If no one else bids you will only pay the sellers starting price plus postage. If someone else bids, say, ￡32, Then ebay automatically makes yours one bid higher  so, ￡33 and keeps doing this for you up to your max bid. So you don't pay any more than you have to. Happy bidding:)|`|P13CpxsUaa	Bid ￡40. Ebay will enter your bid as the lowest winning amount possible (￡31) and it only goes up if someone bids more than you. Say someone bids ￡34, ebay will automatically raise yor bid to ￡35. It does this automatically until you reach your maximum bid.|`|yKylKLGjaa	you enter 40 ebay automatically place the next highest bid for you so you put in 40 and it bid 30 for you if someone else bid 31 it will autobid 32 for you that's why it asks for your "highest bid"|`|OhYE3GhKaa	if there are no bids all you have to offer is the 30 opening bid. if there are no bids up til now, there probably won't be any others. You have to be careful though. A lot of people lie about the product|`|oLVJ9EKAaa	Bid ￡31 and every time it goes up bid one pound more. This means to other bidder who wants the item that you are willing to fight for it!! Good luck!! Happy Bidding.|`|T33Za7jiaa	The first answer is the most sensible answer.|`|citgf07Waa	dont bid it now......wait for about half an hour and if u dont find any increase in the bid slowly bid to 34 pounds... or something|`|5Yu5s2Gyaa	if you put in 40 pounds, then it'll just bump it up to 31.  if someone bids 35 though, it will bump your bid up to 36, and so on until the other person bids over 40 in which case he wins.|`|oZXc84tjaa	Wait until about 5 minutes are left.  Then, see if any bidders have bid, and then if they have, see what they are like, and if you think that it is too much to pay over, then leave it.  If they havnt go for it!|`|v9gxre54aa	dont bid yet- bid later- bidding lets people know that someone else is watching the item so they'll bid again at the last few mins. bid nearer the end time, especially if someone else has already bid|`|bkVXCGbSaa	remeber   its not how much money you bet, its how little you bet...canadian pennines usually win.|`|vLCq6qvyaa	Bid the maximum amount you are willing to pay.|`|AthnjPAFaa	as much as it takes those are fly|`|13276f94c5604edf2d63dca7e6bad81daa	This strategy works if there is a minimum bid or it is not bid-on.<br>  <br>  The best way is to wait until the absolute last minute taking into account your internet speed and the speed at which Ebay processes your bid.   Usually, I can depend on 1 minutes - 45 seconds before I hit the bid button.  <br>  <br>  Bid your absolute max amount you are willing to pay--if you truly want the item.  For Example, If you input 40 pounds, then Ebay will input the minimum bid amount of 30.  IF someone else bids in the final seconds and sees the 30 pound starter and they bid 35---they will not see your automatic counter-bid up-to-40 and you will automatically out bid them.<br>  <br>  The best way though, is to find an item you like and bid the minimum amount and then forget about it.  Remember, many items never get a single bid, so when you check your email, you could be the winner.  Just make certain they have good feedback, and plenty of transactions.  Always pay with paypal so your purchase is protected.  <br>  <br>  You can find some incredible deals on ebay if you are careful.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and happy bidding!

6Djqii7Xaa	OK, I am 59 and have been working with computers and programming for 36 years. If it affects my mind and nervous system, I would have been in big trouble by now.<br>  <br>  There were studies about monitors and radiation from them affecting people using monitors, but today with flat screen LCDs, it is no longer an issue.<br>  <br>  Mostly it is just the mental strain most people have coupled with bad ergonomic factors. Deadlines are always there, and they play with your mind. But that isn't specific to this profession. You just need to be able to realize that there are more important things than the deadline..... your health for example. So you need to put it all in perspective.<br>  <br>  As far as ergonomics, if you are older like me, staring at a tiny laptop sitting in my lap in an easy chair is about the worst thing in the world. It puts strains on your eyes, back .... just about everywhere. These things add up and you don't really notice it happening.<br>  <br>  I recently worked with someone who was feeling miserable at the end of the day after working with a laptop. I had her try my recommendations and now she is stress free.<br>  <br>  Get a good quality monitor, and raise it to eye level so you are not looking down. It takes muscles to keep you heard bent over and looking down, plus you tend to arch your back forward at the same time. By putting it level with your head, the weight of your head is over your shoulders and reduces muscle tension, plus with your head erect, you won't be slouching over creating muscle strain on your back.<br>  <br>  Use a trackball instead of a mouse. If you have to use a mouse, then get a wrist rest. Holding your arm up to move the mouse makes you use many more muscles than you need to with a trackball. Being able to rest your hand or wrist relieves a lot of stress on your elbow, back and shoulder. It doesn't seem like much, but all day every working day of your life adds up.<br>  <br>  The last thing is to get one of those funny looking keyboards that put the rows of keys in a sort of V shape. If you use the straight rows of keys, you have to put your wrists in an unusual "******" position in order to type correctly. This again puts strain on things. With the angled keys, you wrists can be straight and you are much more relaxed. Also make sure that your keyboard is low enough that you don't have to raise your arms to reach it. It should almost be on your lap so that your forearms are about parallel to the floor.<br>  <br>  Do all that, and you will be much more comfortable, and not feel like you have been through the wringer at the end of the day.<br>  <br>  I can't help you with the mental stress created by deadlines other than what I already said. Sorry. No magic there.|`|x785DXRBaa	The computer is only limited according to the user. the only times it is not is when it has a high form of ai in it in which it could increase its knowledge, very little chance your computer has that.

There are also 90 minute/790 MiB and 99 minute/870 MiB discs, although they are less common (and violate the Orange Book standard; note that nothing in the Red, Yellow or Orange Book standards says that disc reading/writing devices may not have the capacity to read discs beyond the standard.) Some drives use special techniques to write more data onto a given disc, such as Plextor's GigaRec allowing as much as 1.2 GB to be recorded onto a 99 minute disc; these techniques inherently are deviations from the Compact Disc (Red, Yellow, and/or Orange Book) standards, making the recorded discs proprietary-formatted and not fully compatible with standard CD players and drives.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	No. 80 minutes is the max.|`|AA11302157	There are some CDs that will hold up to 99 minutes, but they don't play in all CD players.

1IaWOdALaa	You are asking all the right questions.  As for what makes a good puzzle, I think this is a matter of taste.  You will want to write a heuristic to try to grade the difficulty of a given puzzle, and throw out puzzles which are outside the desired range of difficulty.  (Or, better yet, produce puzzles using rules which will guarantee that they fall within the desired difficulty range.)  Here are some thoughts I have.<br>  <br>  To begin with, the direction you choose for a word adds to the difficulty.  A word which heads right (reading order) is the easiest to identify.  A word which goes diagonally up and to the left may be the hardest.  The random characters not part of the words are also important.  For example, if they were all the letter X, it would be fairly easy to find the words.  The hardest is probably to fill up the grid with random substrings of the words at random orientations, making sure to not create another copy of any word, of course.  This will cause a lot of false starts and distractions. As for overlapping words, I didn't find that to be as much of an issue when I did word search puzzles.<br>  <br>  Ideally, you would do some kind of study on people to see what really confounds people of different ages and backgrounds, and then you could assign a score to a puzzle (perhaps multidimensional - maybe a younger child is better at certain aspects of puzzle solving than an older person but worse at others).<br>  <br>  Given that you don't have the resources to do that, you can try to write an algorithm to imitate the typical strategy someone would use to solve a word search puzzle: perhaps picking some random point, going in some random direction, and try to identify a word.  Perhaps different directions would introduce errors in the ability to identify the word and you might fail to see the word even though it is there.  False positives are less likely because the person will typically verify his choice if he thinks he sees a word.  Then, see how many steps this procedure takes before the puzzle is solved.  Run it a large number of times and take an average to find the average difficulty, though variance could also be a factor - every once in a while, maybe you get really stuck.

BhNP2P8Xaa	Laptop and notebook are equivalent.<br>  <br>  Netbooks are smaller, usually with 12" screens and under, with fewer components (i.e. no CD/DVD player) and mobile processors (like the Intel Atom).<br>  <br>  They are designed for portability and wireless use.|`|kQt4ub3Daa	Ok, here's the right answer ... skip the rest of the people who have no clue and just say "no difference" ...<br>  <br>     There are 3 major "sub-classes" of "portable computers", meaning anything that uses a full-featred operqting system (some version of Windows or Linux) instead of a "Windows Mobile" or "Windows CE" which is a smartphone or pda.<br>  <br>     #1)  The notebook computer - These are "desktop replacement" systems that are designed to be a mobile office in themselves, and include big-ticket items like BluRay drives and huge hard drives, and usually an expensive software bundle of security, the newest MS Office Pro, and other useless software to a home user. They also are designed to not need any add-on devices, although they can handle whatever You throw at them for plug-in hardware. Networking can be done by wired, wifi, or anywhere modem card. They're also bulky and heavy and will probably be used plugged into a wall somewhere more than on batteries.<br>  <br>     #2)  The laptop computer - These are the same basic system hardware only as far as the motherboard, RAM, and hard drive are concerned, but have cheaper onboard video and audio chipsets, will usually have a power-saver CPU for keeping battery life longer, and have a less expensive DVD drive (usually a DVDROM/CDRW). These are designed to save physical system weight, cost of parts, and software bundle costs for the Mfr.. Their main purpose is a college student or salesman on the road who doesn't need a complete office or doesn't travel across the country and need continuous entertainment, so they allow You to use a few plug-in devices sometimes, and that means they have power supplies that can support some USB power as well as the system itself and charging the battery all at the same time. networking usually = a jack on the back of the system, and a port for anywhere modems, most are including a WiFi card built-in on the bottom of the case now too, but some are still optional. These are designed to be used most on batteries while out an around, thus the term a "laptop computer" instead of a "mobile desktop (relacement)"<br>  <br>     #3)  Netbooks - The newest sub-class of system, are designed to be not only lightweight, but basically a go-anywhere connectivity system. They allow You to use a few occasinal plug-in devices, and since the USB devices list is so huge they can use an add-in device like a printer, mouse, keyboard, MP3 player, anywhere modem (USB only), or external hard drive whenever necessary, but not all the time. The power supply is designed to charge the battery and use the sytem but not for much more than for long. Networking is done by either a USB anywhere modem or the built-in WiFi card, and the hard drives are between 80 and 160 Gigs. They can be used with an external monitor (the better ones can anyway) which allows You to view hard drive stored movies on a work monitor or dorm TV, but they have no CD/DVD drive (external ones work though if You must use one for something ocasionally), and the screens are a modified resolution so gaming must use an external monitor. They also have a less power-draining mobile CPU which usually has a "step-down" feature that conserves battry life as well, since they're mostly used away from an outlet.<br>  <br>     The most logical design use for a Netbook is for in-home computer repairs or IT staff at a major company for access to online drivers, software updates, and technical info about systems they're working on in the field, as well as connecting a virused or bad hard drive for backup before wiping it out, and that's the purpose I'm planning to buy for.<br>  <br>    They do have a full-featured and updatable Windows or Linux version, and usually don't have any bloatware like the full MSOffice, although they could handle it if You wanted it - better option is to simply use MSWorks and some fileviewers freely dloadale for joke emails in Powerpoint or Word from MS.<br>  <br>     Go forth and spread the word ... and shop wisely ...<br>  <br>  <br>                      Now You know the truth, Good Luck!.|`|AA12269536	Laptops and notebooks are the same.

This is the default, most times, so leaving it out does the same thing.<br>  <br>  To achieve this result without involving client-side scripting (VB or Javascript), you'll need to assign the width of #headerright as a percentage of its parent, which will be the <body>.<br>  <br>  If your target browser(s) supports it, you can use CSS Tables. This would allow a more precise effect by defining the behaviour of the divs as though they were table cells.

Internal harddrives for desktops are very ver different than harddrives for laptops.  The only reason external harddrives work on both is because of the USB 2.0 port that they both commonly share.

The only way you are going to get an ide harddrive to connect to your laptop is through a converter that plugs into your usb port.. which you might be able to boot off of...

Are there any hardware boards that have brown or black marks on them. Look particularly at the fans, the one in the case and the one on the CPU. ARe there any sign of burning. Are the fans free to turn by hand or are they stiff? Check that all the Power Supply Connectors are connected firmly and that these too have no burn or scorch marks on them. If there is nothing obvious then unless you are very proficient with electronic and electrics I would return it to a shop for repair.

If you have and this did not resolve your problem, then give a more detailed explanation and ask more specific questions.|`|gdzLn3FVaa	It seems that you probably deleted a file in your Temp folder or User Settings.  Try going to safemode first if your able too go to system restore and restore to a date where it was working.  If not you have to reinstall your operating system make sure just reinstall the OS not reformat the drive or you'll loose everything.  Reboot your PC make sure your recovery disk is in your CD rom drive and replace system only.  I hope it's a recovery disc if not you once you reload your system all your drivers will be gone and you have to reinstall them hope you had that backup if not Remember your ethernet 10/100 Card is the most important Hardware if help you connect to the internet that way you can find your drivers through your Computer Manufacturer Websight.

zmmxUJeYaa	This is a laptop series from HP-compaq. There are two best products for this series, one CQ60-104TU and CQ60-101AU . I have the CQ60-101AU powered by AMD Athlon 64 ht in my bag now. There are two reason<br>  to go for AMD PROCESSOR. AMD is more cheaper and more reliable than intel. AMD can tolarate more CPU temperature than intel. But the most important cause is that I can have a dual core facility at less cost with this CQ60-101AU Laptop.<br>  <br>  If you wnt to know the technical details you can go to this URL: <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/in/en/ho/WF06b/321957-321957-3329742-89318-89318-" rel="nofollow">http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/in/en/ho/...</a><br>  3768152-3809616.html.<br>  <br>  Features:<br>  CPU SPEED: 1.90 GB<br>  RAM: 1024MB DDR2 (mine is upgraded to 2048 MB ddr2)<br>  Hard Disk: 160 GB<br>  Graphic system: NVIDIA Geforce8200M G<br>  <br>  My experience:<br>  I am using this laptop for now 6 month, and these is quite good to general office work and data processing. You can use this system for your daily office activity and internet access. This is a good valued laptop for your casual use. Obviously it is not good enough for the power user who needs lots of speed and power to the laptop. I am a Doctor , and this kind of laptop is perfect for me. My prymary use is of internet is well fullfilled by this laptop. Office suits works quite good . The most charming feature of this system is its graphics quality.You will be charmed by the visuals of this system. The only problem with this system is that it takes a little bit more time for the initial start up if compared to its competitor intel system(CQ60-104TU). As this system has the advanced Altech Lansing speaker , its sound quality is superior to other system.Weight is a little bit more than expected. Touch pad is good but I recommend using separate USB mouse for better experience.<br>  <br>  <br>  Recommendation: I recommend this system for the casual office user who are happy with internet and office suits.<br>  <br>  Thank you<br>  <br>  <br>  Screen Type:  TFT or Active Matrix Screen<br>  Operating System:  Linux<br>  CPU type:  AMD - Athlon (K7)<br>  CPU Speed (MHz):  Over 1000<br>  RAM:  2 GB

yMchHj9eaa	PC are the best, ask a MAC person, why they are so good, but in reality MACS suck, This is maybe the ultimate reason a mac owner will give you to explain why it's superior to a PC. The mac owner will tell you that all people that own macs are really satisfied with their computers and would never switch back. This is of course not true. The mac owner will also tell you that with a system from Apple you will never have to think about drivers, upgrades or anything. A mac is perfection itself when delivered. At least according to their standard. Many mac:s can't even be upgraded. So what you buy is what you get. Expect your system to be outdated within 1-2 years. Apple also states: "Only with a Mac do you get an operating system built by the same people who built the computer it runs on.". Actually Apple's Mac OS X (the operating system) is not based on their own technology, but by the technology of freeBSD. Apple's own capabilities in form of creating an operating system have been demonstrated in previous versions of Mac OS. It took an operating system based on someone else's technology to get a Mac multitasking and not behaving like an over sized pocket calculator from 1985. Oh and about mac crashing Yes it does! And it does it alot. The difference between a pc based on Windows crashing and a Mac is that on the pc the crash is in 99% of the cases caused by badly coded third party software, when the Mac just has a faulty operating system. Why else would Apple themselves run their india website on Linux RedHat? There is another fun part about crashes on the mac, it's almost always impossible to trace the source of the crash. When your mac crashes you simply reinstall the system. Sounds like a fun thing to do on your spare time, well buy a Mac|`|CoDUHl7Uaa	Mac|`|8QWr77YZaa	PC rapes all..<br>  <br>  Macs are cute!!!

MxculX2Daa	I always use my laptop with the plug in if I am in a building.<br>  <br>  The battery is useful if you are away from a  power outlet - but any time you are near one plug it in.<br>  <br>  The battery will charge up until it is full - and then stop charging.<br>  <br>  Doubtless some people will say to take the battery out when you are not using it because it shortens the life. This is pointless and totally inconvenient and you will be really glad you left the battery in if you ever have a power cut. The laptop will just switch to battery power and you won't lose your work or crash your system.<br>  <br>  Taking the battery out when you are not using it to "extend its life" is about as practical as always entering your house through the window so you don't wear out the door hinges.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	I keep mine plugged in on all the time when at home|`|tA8T4QYFaa	You can also just remove the battery - that will cut down on some of the heat being generated in your laptop.
AA12351337	I wouldn't suggest using it as a monitor stand.  It wasn't made for that so I'm not sure it would be a good idea.  The warranty might not stand if it causes a problem and you tell them that you set your monitor on it.  You can set lighter things on it, but a monitor might be a bit to much.<br>  You can just set it on it's side next to the monitor, though.  It has rubber stoppers or whatever they are on the opposite side of the hard drive for that.

uGUvct02aa	I have the mini with the 16gb ssd.  It ships with a 2gb plug in module as well that sits in a little indented proprietary usb slot on the device...so you have a total of 18 gb plus any usb external drives etc.  I like the ssd as it is faster to boot, uses tons less power and extends the battery life significantly.  I like the keyboard and the overall feel of the device.  Some things to look out for:  (1) webcam SUCKS.  if you want it for the webcam, look elsewhere.  (2) although it looks like it ships with bluetooth (because HP loads the BT driver on all machines by default and it displays an icon in the systray), the base model does NOT have BT.  if that is important to you, you need a higher model that specifically states that it includes BT.  I (and many others) have complained to HP about both of these items and HP has pretty much just said nothing.<br>  <br>  I like the speed and portability of the device.  With the ssd, I can leave the thing on sleep mode for the entire day and still have 50% or better battery at the end of the day.  You can always grab a small 100+gig external portable drive if you need more space.

AutoGK is a package of codecs and a GUI interface that will take the raw DVD data through an AV processing pipeline to produce a single windows video file.<br>  <br>  Step 1: RIP<br>  Put in a DVD and launch DVD Decrypter. Choose IFO (Information File) mode and make sure you’ve selected a destination for your files. Now you need to find which program chain to rip (PGC). Pick the one that’s the longest, or in the case of a TV dvd, the episode you want to rip. Just click the green arrow and wait about twenty minutes, after which you will have a set of files which look like this:<br>  <br>  VTS_01_0.IFO<br>  VTS_01_PGC_07 - Stream Information.txt<br>  VTS_01_PGC_07_1.VOB<br>  <br>  Step 2: ENCODE<br>  Launch AutoGK and select the first .vob that you just ripped as an input file, and set an output file name. Now you need to select audio (choose the first one) and subtitles, if any. If you’re ripping a TV, set the preferred size to 350MB, if you’re ripping a movie, choose either 700MB or 1400MB, depending on your preference.<br>  Finally, click on advanced settings and choose MP3 VBR 128kbs.<br>  Then click “add job” and “start.” After all this, you’ll have a log file.<br>  <br>  Step 3: WATCH<br>  You’re done.

zorYTX59aa	Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you have got Google Web Accelerator or software<br>  similar to it....dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  -- do everything you can to get rid of it. Not only does GWA<br>  totally conflict with and destroy YouTube, clicking on "Don't<br>  Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer-running videos require both "Shockwave" and<br>  "Flash" to play smoothly. You don't need anything else.<br>  <br>  Note 3: a strange fix that once worked for me was changing<br>  the website URL from "www.youtube.com" to "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: depending on the way your account was first set up, <br>  your "video playblack quality" might be telling YouTube that <br>  your internet connection speed is set to either "dynamic" or <br>  "fast" -- which makes YouTube play videos at higher quality. <br>  This in turn eats up a lot of bandwidth, memory and "cache". <br>  If you are "signed-in" on YouTube as you are looking at this<br>  answer, you can actually check your "VPQ" from right here <br>  within Yahoo!Answers by clicking my link just below, which <br>  will take you right to "YOUR VERY OWN" playback setting:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/quality" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/...</a><br>  Otherwise after you "sign-in", click the 4th black option that<br>  will be on the left side, called "Playback Setup".<br>  <br>  Note 5: nothing about playing YouTube videos has changed <br>  in the past 2 years. If anything, the newer Flash players are <br>  causing many YouTubers a whole lot of grief, especially the<br>  5 versions of Flash 10. It is absolutely farcical that there's a<br>  10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. Updates <br>  are typically good for one thing: software/computer conflicts.<br>  I've never strayed away from 9.47, and many flashers swear<br>  by 9.45. Think of them as XP compared to Vista.

Most are usually 4GB. depending on what you use a computer for, a desktop is a wise choice because parts/labor is going to be cheaper if something were to happen down the road. 250GB hard drive is alot of room, but then again it also depends on what you will use the computer for. but later on in the life of the computer, if the 250GB is almost full, you can purchase another harddrive and use that as whats called a "slave". so you'll be running 2 hard drives in one pc.

The yellow download bar always come up when you are trying to run or install a program, but when you have more than 3 tool bars. Example (Internet Explorer tool bar, yahoo tool bar, google tool bar, etc.) then there is not enough room to show the yellow download bar. If you have more than 2 tool bars, take one off then try to install the flash player, or go to your windows (firewall) and try to install it that way. by using windows firewall it would allow this player to be install behind the firewall. Go to Start> Control Panel> and under "Security" click on "Allow a program through windows firewall) and follow directions from there or you can even install it by using internet explorer plug-in. Good Luck.|`|HYedOEbnaa	well there is Google Chrome, Safari, Opera, but out of the three I would go with Google Chrome it is very user friendly.

Each disc should be assigned a drive letter, for example your main drive with your operating system on is always drive c. The window also shows the size of the drive. If you can see your drive there it probably won't have a drive letter assigned to it, so you need to do it manually. Click your external hard drive on te right hand side to select it then on the top row select Action then All Tasks then Change drive letter and paths and it brings up a window where you can select from a drop down box which letter you want to assign to the drive, select a letter and click OK. It will then warn you that changing a drive letter may cause file corruption, click to continue and then that's it. Make sure your external drive now shows a drive letter and close the window. Open 'My Computer' and you should now see your drive.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|tllMnGooaa	Does it appear in the disk management under Admin Tools (control panel).<br>  Also check in bios/cmos for any settings about usb, legacy storage etc.<br>  Also if no luck can you get it hooked up without the combo box ?<br>  Also if you have any other cables to try... and lastly try hooking it up to another computer... if all fails I'd be calling to get a RMA.

You should see a screen that says "Press any key to boot from CD..." or words like that. If not then you will have to change them. Hold on... OK, There are two main BIOS programs in use. To enter BIOS press either F10 or the DEL key while booting. (Rarely there will be another key to press but these usually work.) Navigate to the Boot options using the arrow keys. Change the order to boot to CD first. (May be CD-ROM or CD/DVD... same thing.) Now the machine should give you the "Boot from CD..." message. There is a time limit!

While is used for looping, but in each case you're not going to loop.<br>  <br>  Second, if the whiles ARE intended to be loops, you need to have some way of terminating them.  <br>  <br>  Third, each while actually isn't executing anything.  Those semicolons on their lines create empty statements as the targets of the whiles.<br>  <br>  Fourth, how can this expression ever be true:  (choice == 'I') && (choice == 'i')  ?  How many values can choice have at one time? Same goes for the other two tests.<br>  <br>  Finally, the probable reason all the outputs are 5 is that a new local copy of speed is created each time you call Main() in your return statement.  You're not using the last version.  Hint:  Look into static variables.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|onVUS2fGaa	You are using a local variable to store speed. So, every time you call Main(), it is creating a new space in memory and initializing it to 0. You need to have a global variable, or pass speed by reference (or do you pass a pointer to speed, I can't remember) to Main() to aggregate the speed changes over multiple calls to Main().|`|c4f45cb3208d42f175407510ca9d9c07aa	Been a few years since I've coded anything in C++ but to take a wild guess.

Hope that helps out.|`|JRDsvV3jaa	I'm not even sure how it prints anything...  You're conditions are AND clauses and a character cannot be both i and I at the same time.  Really, you should be using strcmp.  Anyway, you have a line terminator after your while statements, so the compare isn't running anyway... it's dropping into the first case no matter what...<br>  <br>  Anyway, the previous post is right.  You have a scope problem with the var that holds your speed.

";<br>      cin >> choice;<br>  <br>      if ((strcmp(choice, i) == 0) || (strcmp(choice, I) == 0))<br>      {<br>            newSpeed = startSpeed + speedchange;<br>      }<br>  <br>      if ((strcmp(choice, d) == 0) || (strcmp(choice, D) == 0))<br>      {<br>            newSpeed = startSpeed - speedChange;<br>            if (newSpeed < 0)<br>            {<br>                newSpeed = 0;<br>            }<br>       }<br>  <br>       cout << itoa(newSpeed) << endl;<br>  <br>       GetSpeed(newSpeed);<br>  <br>       if ((strcmp(choice, q) == 0) || (strcmp(choice, Q) == 0))<br>       {<br>              return;<br>       }<br>  <br>       // if it gets here, input was not valid<br>      cout << "Invalid option.

DjGEJfaPaa	You don't need to pay for one, you can get one free, but please choose the right one for you (install only one):<br>  <br>  1. AVG Free<br>  a. A simple interface (easier to use than Avast! and Avira)<br>  b. Can detect about 82.82% of viruses<br>  Cons: low virus detection<br>  <br>  2. Avast!<br>  a. Real-time protection<br>  b. It has an option to delete a virus once found<br>  c. Can detect about 87.46% of viruses.<br>  Cons: Too many icons and confusing user interface<br>  <br>  3. Avira AntiVir<br>  a. It can detect malware better than Avast and AVG<br>  b. It's cute umbrella icon<br>  c. Can detect about 94.26% of viruses<br>  Cons: A very sluggish update<br>  <br>  Kaspersky and NOD32 are the best anti-virus programs available if you would like to pay for something better.|`|uGUvct02aa	If you want something that is bloated and oversized but holds your hand through everything...check out Norton 360.  If you want something very effective but that you need to do a little more pro active work with try NOD 32.  If you want something barely there and free try AVG.  Best recommended are:<br>  <br>  NOD 32<br>  Kaspersky<br>  Sophos.|`|wRytd4dPaa	You can buy an antivirus program at your local software retailer, you can also do it online. The hard part is choosing which one. I have found that for normal day to day use you don't really need to buy one as there are several free alternatives available.<br>  <br>  - AVG antivirus is free to download is more than sufficient for your regular internet needs.<br>  - CalmWin antivirus, is another free one, once again more than sufficient. <br>  <br>  I've used both and they are both fine, i've had no issues with them and I am a very heavy web user. As long as you have a software firewall enabled (even the default windows one), you should be ok. <br>  <br>  Of course if you run suspicious e-mail attachments and install various web toolbars, then no program will be able to protect you adequately.|`|04bh2DUvaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I don't recommend the free ones.

However, the Beta download has been pulled for a few weeks now so unless to have the .ISO, you will not be able to get the Beta.

Messenger Users, Targeting Google AdSense Program in Money Making Scheme<br>  Tuesday October 3, 4:09 pm ET  <br>  Financially-Motivated Malware Serves Up Expensive Google Adsense Pages Related to a Rare Cancer <br>  <br>  <br>  FOSTER CITY, Calif., Oct. 3 /PRNewswire/ -- Research experts at FaceTime Security Labs(TM), the threat research division of IM and greynet security leader FaceTime Communications, have discovered a new threat targeting Yahoo! Messenger users, known as the w32.KMeth worm. The new threat sends users to a Web site serving a barrage of Google AdSense advertisements related to mesothelioma, a rare cancer caused by exposure to asbestos. Because of its relation to toxic tort litigation, the cost-per-click for the keyword "mesothelioma" is one of the highest in the online advertising pay-per-click market, making it a prime target for financially-motivated malware writers. Systems are set up by these cyber-rogues to funnel traffic through illicit means, generating clicks on high-paying keywords to produce higher returns on established advertising commissions.<br>  ADVERTISEMENT<br>   <br>   <br>  Unlike the typical worm that propagates when a user clicks on a link to an executable file contained in an instant message, w32.KMeth downloads malicious files into the user's Windows temporary file directory when a user simply visits an infection site using Internet Explorer. When the user visits the infected Web page, the malware uses the PC as a launch pad, immediately sending infection messages to the user's Yahoo! Messenger contacts. The "status message" in Yahoo! Messenger can also be also hijacked, presenting enticing messages to their contacts, such as "check out my blog." The use of this additional social-engineering technique is designed to encourage more visits to the rogue Web pages. At the same time, the user's control panel is disabled, and the home page is hijacked to a Web page that contains text designed to generate maximum revenue through click fraud.<br>  <br>  "Typically, financially-driven malware attacks use botnets to fraudulently increase traffic to specific online advertisements," said Chris Boyd, director of malware research for FaceTime Security Labs. "In this case, the hackers have cleverly borrowed tactics from botnet-creators to create a bot-less network of hijacked PC users to drive traffic to sites populated with these specific Google AdSense advertisements. Introducing the human factor into the scenario makes these 'bot-less nets' much more difficult to detect."<br>  <br>  Google AdSense is a convenient way for Web site publishers to earn money by displaying Google ads relevant to their Web site. Because Google pays the host Web site based on the number of clicks on their ads, the process can be susceptible to what is commonly called "click-fraud," or an inflated number of clicks on a given ad.<br>  <br>  The cost-per-click for the term "mesothelioma" is among the highest in the online advertising industry, because searchers using the term are very likely to be seeking legal services.

Messenger and Internet Explorer<br>  <br>      Threat Type: Worm<br>  <br>      Risk Level: Medium<br>  <br>      How to protect against this threat<br>  This malware has the potential to infect any user of Internet Explorer who visits the infected Web site, but is specifically targeted at users of Yahoo! Instant Messenger. Users can protect themselves by not clicking on links sent to them by other users or contained in Yahoo! Messenger status messages of those contacts on their contact list. Currently, most commonly used anti-virus programs do not provide protection from w32.KMeth.<br>  <br>  Companies that use FaceTime Enterprise Edition and IMAuditor and have auto-update features activated are automatically protected against this threat. FaceTime also recommends activating the Day Zero Defense System within IMAuditor. The system utilizes anomaly detection techniques to analyze multiple characteristics of IM-borne worms and other malicious code against normal behavior, and provides patent-pending protection against many IM threats -- in addition to traditional security signatures. FaceTime RTGuardian customers are automatically protected if they have auto update features enabled. FaceTime's X-Cleaner customers (formerly XBlock) should download the latest update and scan their PC for the worm.<br>  <br>  About FaceTime Communications<br>  <br>  FaceTime enables the safe and productive use of greynets like instant messaging, VoIP, Web conferencing and P2P file sharing.

To do the latter you could first ask what form they want (annual or hours). If it is annual prompt for the annual salary. If it is hours prompt for hours worked and then pay rate.<br>  <br>  Does that get you started? Email if you have questions.|`|dIyB1cCJaa	overloading just means you have two different methods with the same name but are made distinct by the argument list.<br>  <br>  i.e.<br>  <br>  double computeWeeklySalary(double annualSalary) {<br>  return annualSalary/52;<br>  }<br>  <br>  double computeWeeklySalary(double hourlyRate, double hoursPerWeek) {<br>  return hourlyRate * hoursPerWeek;<br>  }<br>  <br>  so then if you call it with one arg you call teh first one.

Xi8LpZC0aa	Why is my computer running so slow and freezing?There are several primary reasons cause your computer to be slow and 2 things you can do to fix it.<br>  First,Corruption and Errors within your registry.The registry is a main part of your computer's Operating System. With time, as you use Windows and install and uninstall programs, your registry will get congested and full of errors. So your computer could slow down. So, if you can clean it up this problem can be solved.Sometimes you can speed computer up by 300%. To clean up registry,You can download a software called regsitry cleaner---Clean registry,remnant,corrupt files and temp files,history,cookies,etc.. This site:<br>  <a href="http://speed-up-pc.info/index.php?t=spee..." rel="nofollow">http://speed-up-pc.info/index.php?t=spee...</a><br>  lists top 5 registry cleaner,from there you can download and scan for free.<br>  Second,Your computer is loaded with spyware/adware.spyware/adware hamper your computer's performance.It use system resources and slow your computer down.<br>  <br>  So, to speed up your slow computer, use a registry cleaner software and clean your registry files first. It will make all the difference, and provide you with the immediate fix you need for your slow computer.Then,download a good anti-spyware to get rid of spyware/adware in your computer.<br>  Source(s):<br>  speed up pc:<br>  <a href="http://speed-up-pc.info/index.php?t=spee..." rel="nofollow">http://speed-up-pc.info/index.php?t=spee...</a>|`|IGJGUfjNaa	There may be several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how. <br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.   <br>  <br>  4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.<br>  Check your drivers. <br>  <br>  5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/fix-computer-freezes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...</a>|`|yMchHj9eaa	Do not use speedupmypc.com, is he serious?

But your Internet connection is around 1-6Mpbs ... so it won't matter if you switch to Ethernet or not, because your wireless connection is not the bottleneck.<br>  --

Some ISPs put a CAP on how much you can download/upload.|`|p6xgtONXaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Quite possibly, why not ask the company for the reason for the capping?<br>  <br>  Arnak|`|AVDTZ63Oaa	That would be the big bad wolf huffing and puffing and utterly FAILING to blow the house down. You have been "capped" because you used too much bandwidth for the tastes of whomever is providing said bandwidth. If they don't IMMEDIATELY uncap you, you should switch services. You are paying for an amount of throughput. If they are not delivering because some chump decided he didn't like what you were doing, they have failed to keep their end of the contract. Call them, tell them to uncap you *** pending a WRITTEN list of what was downloaded. They also CAN NOT see past your firewall if you configured it right, so telling "Jim the Customer Service Jockey"  what the local IP addresses of the machines in your home will get you exactly nowhere. Also...They DO NOT have some freaky database of "high traffic" people. That would be some $10 an hour geek trying to pretend he works for somebody scarier than customer service. <br>  <br>  Look. Get them to uncap you, or get on to a service that isn't run by nanny state schmucks.|`|4RnZ0jO6aa	Well duh, they're not going to cap it for no reason are they?<br>  <br>  They are just saying that every company will know about the cap, so you won't change ISP's and they won't lose business.<br>  <br>  Cancel the contract and find a new IP, one that will not cap your download speeds.|`|iyTAW52qaa	Yep.  Not necessarily illegally though.  If you've been utlizing all of your bandwidth for an extended period of time, they can also do this.  It's dishonest bullshit.  It's all about which ISP you have and what their policies and TOS (Terms of Service) say.

(And that just restores the registry.)  The first thing you have to try is a Windows Repair (with the Repair disk).  If that doesn't work (or if you don't have the Repair disk), do a Windows upgrade with the Windows install disk.  (If you don't have any Windows disks, there's not much you can do.)|`|hOSOawRHaa	Ok, all you need is a windows bootdisk, you damaged your mbr by playing with your boot splash. You can download one from bootdisk.com, get a windows 98se, or if you have the windows cd boot to that and select repair console, then run fixmbr and fixboot.<br>  If you use a boot disk (floppy), run fdisk /mbr, that will repair your master boot record (mbr).

KgtI19bgaa	Norton Ghost does exactly that, makes a 1:1 clone of a hard drive on another hard drive. You hook primary hard drive to Master on the bus, secondary to Slave, and ghost one drive on to another. Done it many times. Look up Norton Ghost.<br>  <br>  ~~ Edit<br>  <br>  Yes, Norton Ghost works on just about any platform; you will deal with hardware mostly. You'll need an empty drive with at least or more free GB than the one you're cloning. Install Ghost on the primary drive; it will prompt you to burn a CD/Diskette for initializing the ghosting; once you hook the slave up and windows recognizes it (Ghost can also format the drive for you in NTFS or FAT32 depending on what the master drive's format is) You can begin ghosting the primary drive to the slave, this will create an EXACT copy of all files, windows, registry, etc. on the drive. Head to Norton's web site and check it out. I used to do field tech support, this tool was one of our greatest tools; sometimes we had to install the same stuff on 20 new machines; instead of doing that we installed everything on 1 and ghosted the drive 19 times to the other machines and updated the licenses.

However, as you accumulate different "states" of your computer over time, the registry is going to get really bogged down with a bunch of extra stuff you don't want and it tends to slow down the computer.  Your real "best bet" would be to backup any data you want to save and, assuming you have an operating system disk and disks to replace existing software programs (like games and such) run a brand new format and OS install on the computer.  Once you have it dialed in, create a restore point that you can always go back to.  <br>  <br>  If you have a bunch of people playing with your computer, you might look into Microsoft's steady state or the commercial program called Deep Freeze.

Even if you have a good antivirus program and a good spyware program it is not recommended to leave your computer on that long. It probably would happen again being in the sleep mode, why not just cut it off and then turn it back on once you get home, or if you need it during the day use it then turn it off. Try that and see how it goes  ok.  I notice that on my computer, When I walking away from my computer for a number of even 30 minutes my computer will freeze sometimes (not all of the time) it depends on how long you leave it idle, but my antivirus alert me when I click to get out of the idle zone (that there were some problems that were taking care of while your computer were idle) so you see anything could happen while your computer is left in the on position. even the sleep mode.|`|d7T3fcl2aa	First of all i wouldent advise opening a laptop with out proper experience  and it migth of just been a loose wire in teh scrren or a boot up problem

If they are online and available, a little green dot will be next to their name and they will be at the top of your list. If you scroll down, the rest of your online friends who are idle will appear with a little grey moon next to their name. This means they have most likely left their Facebook window open and have left the computer.  Sometimes the number will decrease because they have logged off before the list loaded.

If it's not yours, you should not use it.  However, many networks are not secure, and if you are in a public place (or in your own home), receiving the signal, it is really no fault of your own if the owner does not secure the network (encrypt the signal) and you "accidentally" use it.

6945c3804ba3bc1afe9780eced878abeaa	Salutations<br>  <br>  Often our computers get bogged down with all sorts of system clutter and unnecessary start up programs or temporary cookies. I would highly recommend System Mechanic 7, I just downloaded the free trial evaluation and in one go it got rid of all  my puters system clutter, fixed 18 registry problems, got rid of an unnecessary uninstaller, Fixed 3 unnecessary start up items, configured my internet for optimized maximum speed, had a really low memory level of just %14, it just freed up over 193 bytes of temporary and offline files! It freed up my system memory by 23%, my disk drive by 32%,  all in all it repaired 22 problems and freed up 85.95 MB of Space!<br>  <br>  All this is bound to make ur computer run much slower, ours was, and we do take good care of it.

IKZO1oWXaa	The difference between ati and nvidia is a lot like the difference between pepsi and coke , every one has thier own preference.      ATI cards are on the cheaper side , while still hving decent preformance.  but if your really looking for top end stuff i say go with nvidia.  Currently for 300 beans my suggestion would be to get 2 Geforce 8600 GTS OC editions (about 140 each) and SLI them,  (you have to make sure you have a SLI compatablie mother board)  or a Geforece 8800 with 320 MB of ram.   Another suiggestion is to make sure that you have a lot of ram,  and that the ram is fast. I suggest 2GB or ram running at least 667mhz.   this i will add leaps and bounds when it comes to the preformance of the game and the graphic output.    <br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>   PS  Dual core processors are always a major + (and pretty much needed for decent SLI preformance)  <br>  I could give you much better detailed answer if i knew the current pc setup you are working with ,|`|97f9fcdfd0165ebd8d6e600deac9e53caa	CNET recommends the XFX GeForce 8.

utRH3H9oaa	I use Shareaza (<a href="http://www.shareaza.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.shareaza.com/)</a> or try torrents|`|IKZO1oWXaa	Several reasons for this. 1 you are behind a router and hve not forward the correct ports to your pc.  2.  you need to uninstall then install the lateste version of the program.  ,  3,  You ISP is blocking these ports on purpose so you dont use thier service to steal Copyright material.    <br>  4)  I have seen this happen if your LMHOST File has been played wiht by a virus.  not sure why because as i know these programs do not rely on you lmhost file,  (although most VPN and Citrix tpye software will)   <br>  <br>  <br>  Alternative you will love.  GIGANEWS !!!! download tons of movies music, programs and the like  . Its only $10.00 a month  (try it free for 3 days to see if your like it, you will)   <br>  <br>  giganews  or usenet in general is what the professionals use (hackers, techies, system admins, unix/linux nerds)   It beats bittorrent and p2p  a million to one.
