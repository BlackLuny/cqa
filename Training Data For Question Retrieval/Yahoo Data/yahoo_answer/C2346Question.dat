20090304123040AAJAkUx	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	A question for high school students...?	Do you ever feel like you do nothing in school?      In many of my classes, I feel like learning isn't pushed on us- rather, it's optional. Some days I feel productive, but others I feel like my time has been wasted. I think that teachers need to be evaluated more often; at my school, evaluation is extremely rare, and I think it would be useful.

20090303224455AAHUNJ0	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What is your view on college/university attendance policies?	I'm curious as to see what everyone's view is on colleges and universities (as well as individual professors) putting attendance policies into effect for their students. In my college, the general rule is that they only allow 2 absences per semester. If you go over, they have the right to take your financial aid away. However, sometimes my professor's "veto" the school's rules and will allow up to 3 absences per semester.      Do you think that colleges, universities, and professors should even have attendance policies?      I've heard lots of different views:      One side says that no, attendance policies shouldn't even be a thought. College students should be responsible and smart enough to know that they need to go to class. If they ditch their responsibilities, they'll have to pay the consequences of not learning anything, not earning their degree, and have to deal with paying back all the loans they took out for tuition and books when they didn't learn a thing.      Another side says that yes, these attendance policies are great. The threat of failing and getting your financial aid taken away if you miss more than "x" amount of classes per semester gives students that extra push they need to get them to go to class. I've also heard people say that these policies are good because it helps prevent people who just enroll in community college and take out government loans to use for whatever (not tuition, books, housing, etc.).      What do YOU guys think?

20090303221357AApVurc	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How can I get accepted into a decent university while having a previous academic dismissal?	Back in the year 2000, during my first year of college, I did very poorly and was academically dismissed. I had the terrible combination of being unprepared for college, being lazy and this was my first time living away from home. Since that time I've become successful in my field ( I make just shy of $100K/yr ). However, many ( usually larger ) employers won't hire someone without a degree regardless of experience. This really limits my job prospects in major corporations and is preventing me from moving into management. Every university I've contacted said I am not eligible to attend their school due to my academic dismissal nearly a decade ago. Am I really banned from most college for the rest of my life? How can I get into anything other than open enrollment community colleges?

I was a math major because I wanted to be an actuary. I gave up and switched to accounting. Now Im bored. I miss my math classes because I enjoyed working out and solving problems. Some of my classes now are enjoyable but I find them mostly boring and/or too easy. I think the reason I dropped math was because I was not studying enough. I always did well in math and never had to study too hard. But when I took calc 2, I dropped it and gave up. In calculus, you can't just browse through the book and do well. You have to practice and work out problems. I am considering returning to my math major but I am currently in my junior year and because I changed my major so many times, I may have to graduate after 5 years just to get the business degree with accounting concentration. If I switch again, that may turn into 6 years. I am considering a career as an actuary. What is a good path to take?

20090304131734AAsL09t	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	How to make my friend realize she's not AP material?	Okay, I know this is long but please read :)      I have a friend, who I'll call "Jessica" (sophomore), who receives some unflattering grades at school. She has admitted she has been relaxed and has not tried in school at all cuz she just doesn't care anymore. BUT she is being extremely stubborn in saying that she deserves to be in an AP class next year. Her guidance counselor refuses to put her into any advanced courses because she's received nothing but Cs and Ds this year with one B-. She also made a complaint that she should go into AP English because English has always been her best subject (although her average this year is a D). She says it's because our English teacher has not inspired her to try in the class and the teacher hates her and gives her low marks even though she writes "amazing" papers. I am in her class and have never witnessed bias or prejudice by said teacher against Jessica. I've even gotten 100s on Mr. Johns' (English teacher) essays. And in science, we're in honors chemistry courses, she says she should get into AP Bio even though she's on the verge of failing and that her guidance counselor is being "retarded". I'm actually scared to confront her because she can be really harsh and if you tell her something she doesn't want to hear, you're done for. How do I go about making her realize? Do I just leave it and just help her get into AP, where she will most likely fail and ruin her GPA, or tell her the truth, at the risk of my extermination, so that she can go through high school without demolishing chances of college? HELP!

I'm in my last year of University and my business program requires a lot of group and team work.  Somehow I have managed to avoid being in a group with this one stuck up and bossy guy in my program, but my prof made our groups for this assignment and he's in mine.  He has completely taken over the meeting and set meeting dates that are only good for him and not others and called them "mandatory".  I told him I work Mondays and cannot make it to these meetings and that we should make another meeting day ... but he had the audacity to send me an email saying he needs to "re-assess my dedication to our group"!  I'm speechless.  I absolutely hate this situation but have been in it before.  Usually I am a group leader and get stuck with others who don't do any work ... but this time it's the opposite since he is being very bossy.  I hate confrontation and have found that it doesn't help in group project situations, because it will only make it harder to work together.  The worst part is there are group evaluations and I am expecting him to give me a bad grade.  Please give me some advice ... he has already taken over in so far as setting meetings I can't make, selecting which project we are going to do and what topic, etc.  And he is one of those guys that just thinks he is better and smarter than everyone else.  He has his resume posted at the end of his emails!!!  And he wears a suit to class everyday!  Honestly I can't stand the guy.  I just don't know how to handle this!

Question 1 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      Why does Maya Angelou repeat the phrase “Alone, all alone, Nobody, but nobody can make it out here alone” in her poem “Alone”?        Repeating a stanza is part of personification.        Her poems always follow the same pattern of lines and verses.

I know someone's asked similar on yahoo answers before but I'm looking for more points of view.

I'm going to work for a year and a half, and go to college fall of 10' (don't criticize. I have my reasons.) I'm going for social work! :-)       My question is, I'm looking for a nanny job for this summer.. and what not.. doing anything to make some money.       Should I go to beauty school for something early next year though?       (that was my original education plan.. but I now want to be a social worker more)      I would probably go for.. Make up and Nails. So maybe work for a salon through college..       Would I make more money doing this through college??       Or nannying. I do love the idea of both.. but I know I need to make allot of money. I'm paying my own way through college..       My other thought is that after I have kids (way later) this may come in handy for my own business. you know??      Good idea or bad??      And I live in Maine..      do you have any idea what these courses would cost?       I know its like a 3-6 months course. I cant find prices though :-)

20090304122741AAbjCGg	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	I was caught cheating on a test...?	I'm a freshmen in high school. I went in to make up a test for French during lunch today. It was originally almost over 2 weeks ago, and it was on me that I didn't really study enough. I really only reviewed the stuff for 10 minutes before I went to take it. My French teacher gave me my test and I get started. It really wasn't as hard as I thought and I got most of the answers. But, then I got to a section of pure vocabulary, which I just couldn't recall. My teacher went to go get coffee, and there was a book next to me. So, I open it up cause she hadn't been back for over 5 minutes just to get a couple of answers. She comes back and I look back, just completely embarrassed. She asks me what answers I got from the book and I told her the maybe 3-4 I copied. She takes it from and just tells me I'm done. Knowing my French teacher, she's really, really nice, and she probably took off points for the problems I copied or just got wrong. But, she might give me a 0. I can deal with that cause I know it's my fault for cheating. It was wrong, and I was being real stupid. I should have studied more. Now, I feel real bad, cause my teacher is so nice and trusting. Should I go talk to her about it and tell her I could take the zero, or just forget about it? I can't stop worrying ):

The warm sun shone down on a vaguely familiar young girl. She had sleek, light blonde hair, and freckles skimmed along her nose. The girl’s eyes were a deep calm turquoise, people often commented her about how beautiful her eyes actually were. The girl walked down the alley trying to find the end. Her slim shadow lay behind her, as worry started to crease in her crystal blue eyes. The girl started to walk faster and faster, and eventually she could see the end of the alley, a few metres ahead, is where her house lay. The girl was deeply relieved at the thought of lying down on the sofa watching TV; she had had a very busy day. All of a sudden a gust of wind blew, and she could of sworn she had heard someone behind her. She frowned and pursed her lips, nearly at the end of the alley; she carried on walking though this time she took two extra strides ahead.'

20090304133647AAA4Wxf	Education & Reference;Teaching	Masters + Credentialing Program?	I am currently an undergrad getting my degree in physics. I have always planned on being a high school teacher, teaching math and science (physics and calc preferably). My original plan was to finish my undergrad then attend one of those college programs that give a Masters degree as well as teaching credential. However, I hear that a lot of schools prefer peope without Masters degree (I don't know if that's a myth or not), so I'm a little concerned that I will have a more difficult time getting a job with a masters then if I just did a regular credentialing program. Any input would be appreciated.      Thanks

Hey,   I'm a sophomore in high school, and due to the way college is these days, i feel that I should begin looking into where I would like to go. I would like to go to Ohio State, and I've heard its gotten harder to get in. I have a 3.38 GPA and I have gotten a 133 on my PSATs (52nd percentile on the SATs) and I was 59th percentile on my PLAN tests (just under a 22 on the ACTs). So, my test scores suck. Is it hard to improve if I have a tutor? In addition, I am on the golf team (Varsity Letterman). I do B'nai Brith Youth Organization (BBYO), participate in JCWA (Junior Council on World Affairs/ Model UN) and I volunteer at a museum. I plan on taking AP US Government Next year. I also think that I'm a fairly skilled writer so I should have a pretty good essay. Do I still have a chance of getting into any of these schools despite my current test scores? If not, do you have any other suggestions? Please Help Me! It's really frustrating that I can't get any straight answers. lol   Indiana   Ohio St.   Miami (OH)   Temple   UCONN   Wisconsin   Ohio U.
