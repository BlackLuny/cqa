akGi4kUQaa	People have different opinions I guess.|`|A5D62Ycbaa	The cheese makes the nacho's!  Your friend is a fool!|`|kjgonYlgaa	I'm confused by the question.  cheese is supposed to come on nachos! other wise they would just be corn chips.|`|QoPBaVUpaa	sure|`|HC6rrHLDaa	huh?|`|ZiXPRmpFaa	haha..what is this?|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	thanks for letting us know that....|`|VvbOSbRnaa	Cheese is the best part of the nachos!!! Sure, you could always ask for w/out but then they really aren't nachos (unless you dip them in salsa)|`|9WHtStZNaa	I'm not sure what you are asking... But you can't really have nachos without the cheese, just saying...|`|yxAM9b8Zaa	Your friend is a ******* idiot.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	What's a nacho without cheese???|`|h3LXI1Wvaa	uh.. what?

But, no, I don't.|`|KYPhnVe8aa	no, but it is cheap food for Americans who want a lot of food for a little cash.  They make everything with like 4 or 5 ingredients: ground beef, yellow shredded "cheese", lettuce, tomatoes and tortillas.|`|1vbX1KYAaa	ha ha yes it definately is mexican inspired food.  But I would classify it as mexican food....just fast food.  I mean come on it costs extra to put tomatoes on your taco.  That is not mexican at all.|`|9kKgasQcaa	I don't think Taco Bell is Mexican food but it was inspired or kina looks like it might be. But no|`|uCqxkEhUaa	no, maybe mexican-american but not mexican.|`|85vDqn6naa	ummm, no!|`|HBFHZXybaa	Nope!|`|mQGfobADaa	NO.  It's sooo not authentic.  Fake.White-Style.

It's not taco bell|`|Limt9t5Qaa	I do NOT consider taco Bell Mexican food.    I have been Mexican my whole life. I grew up on a farm (rancho) in Mexico. My mother and grandmother both cooked special authentic meals that nurtured me and made me aware of my cultures' cuisine. those memories I will cherish forever and ever. That being said I can NOT remember even ONE time when my mother or grandmother said, "come on mijo I made meximelts and enchiritos for lunch".|`|JfVxCDb7aa	it's a watered down version of the real McCoy---still tasty though, I like most of their items, cept the ones with them beans in it.|`|K2IID2yQaa	yes, think outside the bun|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Heck no!

64966f431eb7c4148256720cef5f2654aa	Immigrants are immigrants, but I guess ignorants are ignorant and you can't expect them not to be, right?    Those responders who are not answer your question but spewing racist crap don't realize that they're zenophobic and that EVERYONE who came to this country after the Native Americans is an immigrant.    Ignorance is bliss, though.    Tam O'Shanter Inn in Los Feliz is very nice, but regardless of where you end up going, be sure to go on the 13th and not on the 14th because otherwise you'll wait two hours for dinner!    Have a great time!|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	Maggies Pub in Santa Fe Springs is very authentic.  Auld Dubliner in Long Beach & Tustin a little more high end.    This link for citysearch will show a bunch more:  http://losangeles.citysearch.com/search?...|`|c55O7jqXaa	http://www.boorah.com/restaurants/CA/los...    Very tasty food.

JfVxCDb7aa	never even heard of the case. Could have had something to do with the oil they were using was used for two different things, like fries and chicken sandwichs'?|`|qE5XIAsYaa	they used beef in their fries????|`|iPlX3P1Faa	they still use it- they also put chicken, turkey, and pesticide in their fries.|`|NRYTCejYaa	McDonald's used to use beef broth in the oil of their fries, which they were not supposed to be doing without informing people somehow, and this also made the item non-vegetarian. The only pesticides are those used to grow the potatoes. Non-organic vegetables will almost always be grown with pesticides as this prevents bugs from spoiling the food. Personally, I feel much better knowing that pesticides were used than risking eating bugs which, while probably not harmful, would still be rather gross. At any rate, they no longer do this and no, they are not adding chicken or other meats as a replacement for the beef broth.|`|4604flr2aa	I think it was the frozen fries themselves that were coated in beef fat... that's what gave/gives them their nice, famous crunchy texture and flavor when they are dumped into the fryers....     Not sure if they stopped using the beef fat coated fries or not... but I just don't eat their fries to be on the safe side.
tzrLDbHWaa	Its just a commercial.  During the Super Bowl, they ran a commercial where Jack was talking to another businessman and he walked out into the street and got hit by a bus.|`|gaXUIduMaa	It is a clever advertising campaign.  The latest commercial had an executive wanting to continue Jacks lead (while using his own ideas) but did not know about you being able to order anything on the menu at anytime (i e breakfast for dinner).  It is probably a move to show how JIB is different from the rest and, when they have miked it enough, he will wake up, fire the guy and then maybe even add some more changes.  My guess it will string out to late spring or early summer.  There is some video at their website but I did not open it.|`|V7JVKApkaa	Only the lamest marketing campaign this year. It's a pathetic waste of time and effort. Does anyone really care? No buzz at all. Denny's Super Bowl marketing got such much more play and attention.|`|AA10602324	What's sad is that someone sounds like they're doing marketing for Jack in the Box.....but then they go and misspell a word such as GENIUS.  How stupid is that?|`|pueeMH6gaa	He's in a coma because he ate one of his own burgers and got an e. coli infection.  Just like some Jack in the Box customers got a few years ago.|`|pgdTmT6caa	Jack goes thru a lot in life and this is just one of those things that happen to him.|`|ZIrTB2oEaa	i'm so worried about Jack, he might die.<br>  <br>  I pray every morning and night, and eat his food all day.<br>  <br>  by the way, try the new "TACO NACHOS"<br>  <br>  they make nachos out of those awesome tacos, cut up into triangles and covered in nacho cheese and jalepenoes!  GENIOUS<br>  <br>  SAVE JACK<br>  <a href="http://www.hangintherejack.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hangintherejack.com/</a>|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	back in the 70's they killed jack, and then in the 90's they brought him back. its just an advertising campaign.|`|n6NthDxwaa	I heard on the radio this a.m. that Jack (in the) Box was hit by a bus and is in a coma.

Need to be 16 because of Insurance purposes and some places won't emply you until 18 as we found out last yr when daughter was about to leave school.  BHS employ specific Saturday staff  so it is worth trying there.  Don't give up - keep applying.  If you are in UK try these people as they are very helpful and even have jobs handed to them from emploers looking for young staff even school leavers.   Connexions also have bases within schools - you may not know about it but ask yr librarian about Connexions info as they usually meet in private art schools for confidentialitiy purposes but you can slso contact them directly for help and advice on anythiong so long as you are in Uk and between 13-19yrs old.
