hl4kkvXhaa	I have no clue what "zwinky" is...though I'm PRETTY sure it's not in any dictionary I've ever perused...I've seen it around a lot, and thankfully no one I know has ever picked it up, or I might have to smack them in the back of the head to get it unstuck!  Seriously...it sounds like some weird sort of STD or something...    As for ying yang...I've actually heard this term, and it usually is a less vulgar way of saying "butt".  But I've only heard "out the ying yang", so maybe there is another meaning that I'm missing here...    What is up with the stupid words people make up these days?!  They aren't cool...they don't sound the least bit intelligent...am I really getting so old that I don't find humor in this stuff anymore?!  Doesn't anyone speak English anymore?!    OK...I'll shut up...I'm sure that adults were giving the same gripes back when I was a teen...:(
1ba42140d1f9acb21032404ca6d19392aa	Pay attention to the teacher. I know for a fact that as long as you show your trying and don't mess around you'll make a good impression.    I know you've probably heard it before but just try your best. Your there for yourself, no one else. Just enjoy it.|`|I5czPhYlaa	I was just recently in the same position as you, my advice be friendly & do the best you can.

94MyeH19aa	are you asking which one to get or which one we prefer? I prefer electric coz thats what I play, and it stands out more in songs, but they're both pretty equal. if your deciding what to play thats your choice, you cant solo as well on bass, but you can still play and write riffs, and if you wanted to be in a band, its easier coz good bassists are harder to find than good guitarists, and you can still write songs on bass as well. not like drums which is good but you cant write songs|`|oE65cYZVaa	Those are not mutually exclusive categories.|`|ljLIjkXfaa	Choose bass..Its much easier to get into a band as a bass player than guitarist since guitar players are mroe common than bass

dsgXLjiUaa	I find it well not.., interesting. A lot of people think like this. I feel it to be a bit... I have no word to describe it. It just is. I just don't feel anything from it.|`|J8xRVPulaa	I don't think this is all that bad, but it gets a bit repetitive, and you are just touching on purple prose. It is an interesting concept though, just that i don't think you convey the emotion stronglt enough. Emphasize his internal struggle.    And i disagree, not a lot of people or everyone thinks this way. I don't see how anybody could make such a generalizing statement like that.
4lGH7nFXaa	Too some people it just looks cool or there trying to keep up there social status with friends.I have the ones I do because they represent some of the things I have done in my life,Military being the most important.Just remember one thing,it may just be a phase he's going threw and try too keep from telling him how bad you think they might look,it might make him want even more.|`|hCI6HFEnaa	Some people get tattoos just to look good; which is kind of stupid.    But some people get tattoos because they want to keep a special memory of a thing or person.    I think tattoos are OK as long as they're there for a valid proper reason.|`|ZzBGpGudaa	There are a couple reasons someone might want one:  1) In memory of a lost loved one.  2) Commitment to a loved one  3) To remember a great thing that happened  4) Some people do think they are cool.  5) Some people get tattoos to represent their religions.  etc...    So really, they aren't too pointless and with modern technology, they aren't even permanent. You can get them removed or covered up.|`|GXCk6VQxaa	too look stupid.. im with you i love god and idk why people do stupid things every one needs jesus.. soo dey can be helped
8yE2sYGeaa	sadly, one of the finest, Greg Irons, is no longer with us. he went to Bangkok to improve his art and was run over by a bus|`|TvThS81Naa	I can't tell someone who would be the best artist for them. I have my own personal favorites, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are the best artist for someone else. Take the time to interview potential artists and find out what their specialties are. Make sure you know what you want and find the artist you feel best suits your needs. Be willing to pay for quality, be willing to travel if necessary, and don't be afraid to walk away at any point from someone you don't feel 100% comfortable with.    but here are some artists:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...  http://www.myspace.com/nikkotattsu  http://www.brandonbond.com/flashsite.htm...    and here are some featured artists:  http://tattoo.about.com/od/featuredartis...

LCAzlHhEaa	My course was advertising design...more or less the same thing.  We utilized photoshop, illustrator, and quark to do projects.  We learned the do's and don'ts of advertising such as what color schemes are most pleasing, learned about fonts and how to limit your font use to no more than 3, etc.    My course was beneficial.

RusCWuUlaa	It's hard to say since you don't have one specific genre of photography. I would use your name because no one else will have it and you obiviously don't want to corner yourself in one specific catorgory of photography so i think your name is the best way to go.    Emily T. photography  Tarai photography      if you go by emma as well you could do  Emmazing Photos  (this wasn't my idea i saw it some where)      Just keep in mind that when it comes to the name of a business, if your name sounds too "corny" to someone, no matter how good your work is they won't give you a second thought. I wish I was creative but I'm not ha ha it took me about 4 months to think of a name for mine and all it ended up being was bcephotography i was going to do brita photography but it was already taken.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	Photos by E.T.    hehe... but it fits|`|jIk2ttH1aa	Tarai Photography    Slogan here.
skFwTJ1oaa	They are good...  The better brand you get the more longevity your paintings will have, but really, even with cheap paint they will last as long as you live.   Oils are good too, prob better, because you can blend easier and they don't dry right away, but that also a bad thing, because they take a very long time to dry.|`|cgG7VHhFaa	Acrylics are definitely the way to go these days.  I like Liquitex, especially the basics series.  same colors as the heavy body kind, and they last longer.  They're versatile. You can paint watercolor or slap it on like Van Gough.|`|ZHUkUJkhaa	They are good for flat block colours i find.    I prefer oils, it allows more time to blend and perfect!    People usually start out with acrylics.    They are water based, so easy to clean up|`|bd02755431b4c8dcb913b79038bbe01caa	Hi, I am a newcomer to painting however in the last year I have been experimenting and I have found that I like and can work easily with Acrylic paint.

6eVJpomYaa	Well, I'm going to tell you everything that I do. See, I've always been comfortable singing in the car with my friends, as I'm sure you are too. So, any time that I have had a solo, or competition, I always just imagine that I'm sitting in the car, listening to the radio and singing with my friends, but I'm singing a lot louder than I do in the car.  As for singing advice, I would just keep listening to the song on YouTube or Limewire, and keep practicing until you feel comfortable.    Hope this helps!|`|OPrV0NxMaa	Well im also in the advance classes in theater, im not musch of a singer. To get over stage freight  myself I carried my scrip in my hands rolled up. This puts you into a safe place beacuse it makes it seem like rehearsal, but guess what i never did look at the script and i performed perfectly. well it will seem pretty weird to carrier a rolled up paper but it works on some cases|`|7e58d28d80da5f1093ab891def2733e0aa	I have bad stage fright too. I just prepare myself. I think that if I'm prepared, things will go the way they should. I make sure I know every note and word.    And what also helps is, I tell myself that I'M the one with the talent. I'M the one that got the solo, so OF COURSE I'm good enough. I don't know, that always helps me, lol.|`|d781eClkaa	I'm in the advanced theater class at my school. When I have any role, the best way to get over the nervous shakes or the general stage fright, I try to find a focus point. This is a point located generally in the back of the room or auditorium that you look at the entire time. The purpose of looking there is to distract you from your own stage fright. Another technique is to imagine that you're talking or singing to a friend- try to pump up your game because you want to impress your friend (talk a little louder, sing a little more clearly, elaborate with your hand gestures and body language... stuff like that). As for singing advice, try honey in some warm tea beforehand to clear your throat. Before the show starts, avoid coughing or shouting as these wear down your voice and make it raspy. Generally before shows, actors tend to say certain phrases repeatedly to help themselves enunciate so the audience will hear their clearest voice. One of the phrases that I can remember is "Moses supposes his toeses is roses. But Moses supposes erroneously". It's odd to say out loud, but in the end, your voice usually ends up more crystal clear. The last bit of advice I can offer is to relax and give it your all. That's what the most professionals rely on. :]
xFdz9CMKaa	China and India have the world's highest populations, I think.  The other areas with massive population growth are other developing countries.  Countries in the Westernized world have the opposite problem - not enough people having kids.  A lot of places in Europe will pay you to have kids because the birth rate is negative.  While the US isn't overpopulated, we're using up much of our freshwater resources because of rising populations in cities.  I could see India having some population control, but not really anywhere else other than China.  Developing countries just don't have the bureaucracy to support such an operation, and the US has so many anti-abortion activists that we wouldn't get anywhere close to such a thing.      But if the world can't support this population, people either A) will fight over what is there, B) die of starvation, or C) some new disease like bird flu will decimate everything.  Highly unlikely but possibly D) any of the history channel's stupid apocalypse shows where a meteor or a gamma death ray or a super volcano blows up the earth.|`|e4tvh1d2aa	waiting for that here in usa|`|w2qV8WEmaa	It will depend on the birth rates.    The government will have no choice because the birth rates is too fast. When food production and job creation cannot cope with the birth rate.  Social unrest will occurs and the country will become destablize.|`|mtNxe7Nnaa	some wil,l others won't|`|OQU8TMV0aa	In the 70's the media decided that its "issue of choice" would be population growth just as there has been the issue of water pollution, and global warming. All are valid topics, but they were initially brought to the publics attention through manipulation by the media. So, there was sort of  a scare of the world with an out of  control population, so people began to advocate "zero population growth" meaning that you and a partner would have only two children, merely replacing yourselves. Our population increase rate is going up because our medical technologies are much more sophisticated therefore preventing some natural population control. So, yeah, eventually the issue will probably be addressed by some countries, but only when it becomes a popular subject again. Nature does have a way of of regulating population though, on its own. Heard of the Bubonic plague? Half of china's population died in the middle ages.|`|AA12107250	Rich Chinese can get around this. Can pay n' stay, or even move to Taiwan or Hong Kong where restrictions don't exist. What were once 'seasons' are now 'quarters,' and what we do to our environment in the name of prosperity from quarter to quarter may define the terms of a gradual extinction that will make population restrictions unnecessary. If I can afford to have a child (pay for schooling, medical expenses, etc.) along the way, nobody will deny my right to parenthood. Even if mom needs an ovary transplant to do it, even if dad has a low sperm count from eating too many toxic shellfish, if I can pay for a medical procedure that will help me have a child, or a dozen, or whatever, then there as well, nobody will deny my... given right to go forth and multiply. Who knows, maybe it is a form of survival mechanism or a longing for equality that makes destitute people have children they will not be able to feed clothe or shelter... for even though one can't afford to eat out on the town every night, or can't jet off to Paris or Tokyo to get the newest spring wardrobe, or can't even afford a second summer home, one can at least be fearful and hopeful to make babies no matter whether rich or poor, uneducated or only too well-aware.|`|FoIxsunVaa	The birth restrictions in China resulted in massive female infanticide so I don't think anybody wants to recreate that situation, even the Chinese.    The population of China today is 6 to 1 MALES. There are a lot of lonely, angry young men in China.|`|AA11488628	eventually yeah i think they will. it is a form of population control and in such a place as china where they are widely overpopulated it is a necessary thing. eventually i think it will become necessary in other countries.|`|VzJcl7WAaa	i think so yes.

d781eClkaa	Well, from my own experience, it seems a bit awkward to be in the car with your date's parents. Meeting her there might put the pressure off of her, because parents tend to make things more tense than they have to be. But my own experiences are probably different than hers. What I suggest is to ask her and do what she wants to do or what's more convienient. Being picked up or meeting your date doesn't make a date any more or less romantic unless you really screw up big; this is pretty hard to do if the girl really likes you.|`|m33uUyRYaa	have your parents pick her up unless she can drive then have her drive or meet her. She won't care but she might be going with her friends to the dance so if she is then meet her there. :)|`|HE3IkyL8aa	Oh, well I was you once.|`|J4HqyIvAaa	More romantic would be 2 pick her up of course, but u maybe meeting her there, since u cant drive yet, but u fell more better about not being able 2 drive...try 2 get her something pretty 2 wear for the dance, like a flower..or something
D4BVISmCaa	Hello Zach B,  Two liter is a big bottle. I think you may use it until the gas gets cold so it stays inside without pressure and this will happen rapidly. I have seen a guy on YouTube melting glass in the microwave. Yes I know, it is strange.  He makes glass red hot and whether it is still glowing or not, he puts it in an old microwave and after half a minute it melts to yellow liquid. The real thing. He made holes in bottles. Perhaps you could try if you repair any old microwave. I do sometimes after picking them up and mostly they just need a fuse. Listen, this glass blowing is dangerous so you better learn it from a professional in a factory and use plenty of protection.  These water pipes are mass produced and much cheaper to be bought. In the Netherlands anyway. I wish you success.

Italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the familiarity with death that this brought thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife.[24] It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art.[25] However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.[9]|`|heF3HIzQaa	More than one answer has been put forward, and there is also debate on exactly WHEN the Renaissance started.    Popular theories include:    Knowledge bought back from the Middle East during and following the Crusades.    The dispersion of Christian scholars and their books around Western Christendom following the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453 (though most sources date the START of the Renaissance to before then).    Ditto the invention of movable type printing circa 1450. No doubt that cemented and sped up the Renaissance massively, but the start of the movement predated it.    Others look to the peculiar social set ups of the Italian City States, which valued learning and led to a new appreciation of the wonders of Italy's Roman and Greek heritage.    Take your pick.

There's an art show I was a part of last year and will be this coming year, and I'm sort of known for Emulsion Lifts.    Oh, and little trick I picked up...  Emulsion Lifts work just as well for 3 dimensional object with 669.  Fuji's a little trickier.    Update: The last Emulsion lift I've completed was using Fuji FP-100C (A silvery metal wine carafe), and I've been working on one of those plasma globes using Polaroid Type 669.|`|1FAggU5Zaa	no

ZWDvyuG9aa	Wow your a great writer. I think everything was perfect. And as a preface it was wonderful. I'm writing my own book right now and was wondering if you would read some of the first chapter and tell me what you think about it? If you will just email me saying that you will and I'll send it to you. Keep up the awesome writing!  Best answer pretty please!  ~jessica|`|undqiy6zaa	I am not a big fan of third person.. but I read it anyways.    Yes its confusing, but I get a general idea. Some of your dialogue needs some editing.     For example, "No, the-the bastard left us here!" - perhaps it may be better if it is "No, th-the bastard left us here!" or even get rid of the "h" in the. You stuttered fine after that.    Another, Is he...is he, here? - Do you really want a comma/pause there?    Some of the dialogue just doesn't sound crisp.. other than that its a good preface.|`|oLOtIsBzaa	It was brilliant.

If something at a specific moment of time is complete, then in it is in that period of time "perfect". As time advances, things are improved, and this version, if considered perfect in it's time, is also perfect, until something comes along that supercedes it's perfection.
ZbnVjxQOaa	This is a very good question and one which reflects on why he was assassinated in 1963.    What would have been different was we would have pulled out of VietNam before it became a  major war. JFK said to Walter Cronkite that "ultimately it was their war to win or lose", and had issue orders for our advisors to come home, the first batch was to leave VN on the day of his murder.. Those orders were countermanded within two hours. This was in an era where it took two weeks to change orders.    Kennedy had begun to issue debt free money, currency denoted as "Treasury Notes", these were paper dollars issued by the Treasury Dept. directly, without paying interest to the Federal Reserve System. Had he lived, we would have seen more, perhaps the end of the FED which is an unconstituional entity.    Had JFK lived, there is no doubt he would have fulfilled his pledge to "break the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to th wind."  The Bay of Pigs fiasaco was solely the fault of the CIA and they continued to hit Cuba with raids despite JFK's order to the contrary.  Had he lived, he would have cut the CIA cancer from our body politic and that's probably the main reason why he was assassinated.    Understand, I was not a JFK fan at the time, but history has proven him a great patriot and president. HIs death was a coup-de-tat in America and our country has NEVER been the same afterwards. Understanding the Kennedy Assassination is understanding where we are to-day.      The world would have been vastly different had JFK lived, and our country all for the better.|`|PG7WfGpHaa	Somebody else would have had the chance to shoot him.|`|qDSvOOwBaa	A senseless question.      It had gotten to the point that his presidency was over-one way or another. The plot in Miami was spoiled 3 weeks before by a loudmouth named Joseph Milteer. The motorcade was called off but it really didn't matter. If not Dallas it would have been somewhere else.    Sadly, by his own doing. JFK had lost all protection from practically the entire government-even his own staff despised him. This left only the national media to protect him-after he was dead.    After the JFK act in 1992 over 1,000,000 documents were released. They can be viewed in the Archives and one that has always struck me the most is an NSA(The White House) intermemo that list 147 threats on JFK's life if he went to Dallas. He never saw it and no one even bothered to tell the FBI, the SS or even the President himself.Amazing if you think about it now days.    s_e_s|`|1o05hQ1Uaa	There wouldn't have been a considered "curse" and Bush wouldn't have been president.|`|mnIeK8q6aa	I don't think Bush would be known as the worst president in US history and compared with Bill Clinton: Bill was a virginal saint.    Lots of things blamed to Johnson were actually done under JFK, such as the extended commitment to the Vietnam war. So, for starters: the Vietnam war would rest solely on his shoulders. I'm reasonably certain he'd try the Bay of Pigs again. Or get rid of Castro by other means.    Bill Clinton wasn't a saint, but JFK behaved like a Frenchman in a whorehouse with an unlimited creditcard. Worse: the whorehouse was controlled by the maffia.     JFK wasn't a very good president, but he had the good fortune to be murdered just in time.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Well, JFK did not stage the Gulf of Tonkin incident;  LBJ did (See Pentagon Papers) so we would not have plunged into the Vietnam war as we did.  Kennedy had ordered the reduction of military advisers to South Vietnamese.  He did not order 500,000 land troops to be there.  That was Johnson.  He did not order the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong with B-52s, that was Nixon.      So America's involvement in Vietnam would have been different, and Vietnam was the singular event that caused the alienation of the people to their government that was just being healed when Bush (W.) came along to cause it all over again.

I am currently reading a series of books and sometimes you get too caught up in reading that time goes so fast and when it is time to go out or have something to eat I am continously wondering what is going to happen next.    It is a bit annoying when books that you have read are made into movies as you always have an opinion of what someone looks like and then there are the other bits that they leave out or even change and so on many occasions, I only wished books were never made into movies.

Li Bai    The River-Merchants Wife: A Letter    While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead  I played at the front gate, pulling flowers.  You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,  You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.  And we went on living in the village of Chokan:  Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.    At fourteen I married My Lord you.  I never laughed, being bashful.  Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.  Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.    At fifteen I stopped scowling,  I desired my dust to be mingled with yours  Forever and forever and forever.  Why should I climb the lookout?    At sixteen you departed,  You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,  And you have been gone five months.  The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.    You dragged your feet when you went out,  By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,  Too deep to clear them away!  The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.  The paired butterflies are already yellow with August  Over the grass in the West garden;  They hurt me. I grow older.  If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,  Please let me know beforehand,  And I will come out to meet you  As far as Cho-fu-sa.

W8F9PboZaa	Im currently insanely excited for it. I always am and ended up being bitterly dissapointed but that's ok. The months of excitement make up for it. According the screening reports, everyone who has seen it has loved it, Mugglecast cohost Eric Skull loved it.     There are a few other things that are worrying. Honestly the conversation with the muggle prime minister being cut doesn't bother me at all. I really just found that to be a catch up chapter to trigger the memory of non-insane fans. The battle after Dumbledore's death doesn't worry me too much either. They'll probably put that stuff in before. If they don't then I'll be pretty pissed. They're missing Dumbledore's funeral. Which I'm not thrilled about. And they're adding the random scene where the burrow is attacked? Wtf. The fact it's rated PG is terrible. I mean what? I'm having a cry over Harry/Ginny too, and the fact they don't have their common room kiss. I was such an insane H/G shipper when this book came out that I was jumping and screaming when I read that scene.     Despite the smarter half of my brain screaming at me that I will be dissappointed and there's so many things that we already know are messed up for this film, i'm still insanely excited. Potter fever, i can't help it.    And for the record I hated Prisoner of Azkaban. I think Cuaran massacred it. The firebolt not being in it? No marauder backstory? and what was with Harry crying? wtf? meh. I didn't like Order of the Phoenix much either but I really enjoyed Goblet of Fire. Probably my favourite of the films.|`|swxiulwtaa	No I don't agree. It's not like there isn't any action after Dumbledore's death. There is still Harry chasing Snape (MORE IMPORTANT) and they still do the dark mark, destroy parts of Hogwarts, and burn Hagrid's hut. And Dumbledore's funeral isn't a crucial scene. It's just a send off to him. There is still Ginny realizing there horcrux journey doesn't include her, and RAB.   I honestly don't see what everyone is so upset about. I was more dissapointed to see that they cut so many memories. But I'm sure it will still be fine. When I saw the kid playing young riddle that just blew me away. I can't wait for that scene.     Overall, I prefer to look at the books and movies as to individual things. Books are not movies. I can completely understand why filmmakers do what they do. Not 100% of whats in the book SHOULD be in the movie, and I completely support all of Yates's decisions. Just ask yourself this: If this was never based off a book, would I still say it was bad? Does it still work as a movie even with book scenes cut out? I think they do.    And nearly everyone at the test screening said they LOVED the film (and some were book purists)|`|DMjxbn3Jaa	I totally agree.

Judge by plot and acting not by the Cover or PG rating.|`|Xnhm6bWnaa	oh goodness really? thats terrible! then how will anyone know whats going on!! the conversation with the minister was the most informative in the book really...i dont really like the movies anyway but could they     1. pick a director  2. have JK in the editing room for gods sake  and 3. not butcher the plot and add crazy things for once|`|Yr8mWzS8aa	The death scene is gone? But McGonagall kicks *** in that. :(    The funeral SHOULD NOT have been cut. It is important. Isn't it where Harry breaks up with Ginny too? They are going to have to have that happen somewhere else/someother time now.    The converstation between the two prime ministers was actually very important. It is absolutely ridiculous to think that the return of Voldemort would not affect the muggle world. The wizard and muggle worlds co-exist in the SAME place, only the muggles are unaware of the wizards presence, usually due to charms and enchantments. To not include the prime minister to prime minister conversation basically leaves a huge plot hole. If these two worlds co-exist how can a war be waged in one without any affects or awareness in the other?    I know that a movie can never compare to the book, but what has been happening with the last couple of movies has been atrocious! Seriously, the fifth one left out so much plot that it didn't even make sense. I nearly didn't even understan it and I've read the book soooo many times! I will still go and see the movie, but I have a feeling I'm not going to love Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince movie.|`|MI3r3jWeaa	Yeah I agree, someone asked thins question a few days back and i went off my nut coz thats when i found out.

pI5jKfmaaa	The history of Australia from 1851 - 1900 continues Australia's colonial history, the discovery of gold in 1851 which led to increased economic and political independence from Britain and a great debate about federation    Gold rushes    Main article: Australian gold rushes  The discovery of gold, beginning in 1851 first at Bathurst in New South Wales and then in the newly formed colony of Victoria, transformed Australia economically, politically and demographically. The goldrushes occurred hard on the heels of a major worldwide economic depression. As a result, about two per cent of the population of Britain and Ireland emigrated to NSW and Victoria during the 1850s. There were also large numbers of continental Europeans, North Americans and Chinese. Gold produced sudden wealth for a few, and some of Australia's oldest wealthy families date their fortunes from this period, but also employment and modest prosperity for many more. Within a few years these new settlers outnumbered the convicts and ex-convicts, and they began to demand trial by jury, representative government, a free press and the other symbols of liberty and democracy.       The Eureka Stockade (1854)Contrary to popular myth, there was little opposition to these demands from the colonial governors or the Colonial Office in London, although there was some from the squatters. New South Wales had already had a partly elected Legislative Council since 1825. The Eureka Stockade, an armed protest by miners on the Victorian goldfields, and the debate that followed, served as a significant impetus for democratising reforms.[citation needed] In 1855 New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania (as Van Diemen's Land was renamed) were granted full responsible government, with bicameral parliaments in which the lower houses were fully elected. The upper houses (Legislative Councils) remained dominated by government appointees and representatives of the squatters, worried that the radical democrats might try to seize their vast sheep-runs. Their fears were partly justified, with the Selection Acts of the 1860s, in particular the Robertson Land Acts of 1861, beginning the slow breakup of the squattocracy in Australia's more settled areas.    The gold rushes and the rapid expansion in settlement which followed were a catastrophe for the indigenous Australians. Between first European contact and the early years of the 20th century, the Aboriginal population dropped from an estimated 500,000 to about one tenth of that number (50,000). Many were killed outright with gun or poison, a great many more were starved to death by European conquest of their lands, but by far the most significant killer was European disease. Smallpox, measles, and influenza were major killers, many others added their toll - for a people without the thousands of years of genetically evolved resistance to diseases that Europeans had, even chickenpox was deadly. Of the 90% of the Aboriginal population that died out as a result of European contact, it is estimated that around 80% or 90% of the deaths were the result of disease, and reasonable to suppose that the worst-hit peoples were the ones that lived in the most fertile areas, where population densities were highest.     Booms, depressions and trade unions     Eight-hour day march circa 1900, outside Parliament House in Spring Street, Melbourne.The rapid economic expansion which followed the gold rushes produced a period of prosperity which lasted forty years, culminating in the great Land Boom of the 1880s. Melbourne in particular grew rapidly, becoming Australia's largest city and for a while the second-largest city in the British Empire: its grand Victorian buildings are a lasting reminder of the period. The traditional craft of Stonemasons in Melbourne were the first organised workers in the Australian labour movement and in the world to win an eight-hour day in 1856. Melbourne Trades Hall was opened in 1859 with Trades and Labour Councils and Trades Halls opening in all cities and most regional towns in the following forty years. During the 1880s Trade unions developed among shearers, miners, and stevedores (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all blue-collar jobs. Shortages of labour led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an eight-hour day and other benefits unheard of in Europe. Australia gained a reputation as "the working man's paradise." Some employers tried to undercut the unions by importing Chinese labour. This produced a reaction which led to all the colonies restricting Chinese and other Asian immigration. This was the foundation of the White Australia Policy. The "Australian compact", based around centralised industrial arbitration, a degree of government assistance particularly for primary industries, and White Australia, was to continue for many years before gradually dissolving in the second half of the 20th century.    The Great Boom could not l

0Pv2jt8faa	Hmm I don't prefer stepping on anyones style but I can provide some basic guidelines:    1. Try not to use a big word where a small one would suffice.    2. Rhythm is always a plus with poetry, you say this is a song and I don't know the tune, but for optimal win I'd suggest matching vocal inflection with the beat of the metronome. Rhythm goes all the way back to Shakespearen playwrighting.    3. If you write a song/poem for a person, try not to make it central on yourself or you in general, it's a testament to how much you appreciate, respect, and care for this person.    4. When in doubt, it's the thought that counts.

You could narrow it down further if she will tell you the day of the week she was born, otherwise take your best guess.
BjBkO0CSaa	Okay - I'm only a high  school senior, so I don't know how much this will help.  But we just finished reading Hamlet in English, and there was an allusion to Nero [Hamlet doesn't want to kill his mom like Nero did, but he wants to "speak daggers" to her to see what she's doing, which is sleeping with her late husband's brother.]  So I don't know if this would be too generic, but something along the lines of tragic flaw, and how it leads to catastrophe.  Not sure how it would go, since I haven't thoroughly studied Nero/Caesar, but if you can make it work...    Hope that helped, a little (?) Good luck (:|`|cgb4WOnVaa	Here's one that will draw some flames from my fellow conservatives:    George Bush and Nero - Fiddling while Rome burns?

I'd also assume that Thoreau envisioned a different set of social problems that MLK faced.    These might be starting points for your essay, after you've read the texts in question. Thoreau can be a bit of a bore, but MLK was a stirring speaker. I'd think his speeches might be good to read. You might even find them on tape or video somewhere. Maybe on the web.

V30ELJjiaa	A world without technology would be nice & will help alot with the environment & our "happiness"  Unfortunately we need technology to survive. For example hospitals need light & electricity to keep people alive & well. What we know about the world today is based on technology.   If technology happens to be gone, then it would have to be done slowly, you couldn't just get rid of it all at once.  Clothing would be different due to the lack of technology. More fabrics wouldn'td be available, and alot jewelary wouldn't be made an turn out to be rare due to the lack of mining technology.  So yes a world without technology would be nice & might make life happy & healthy, but it wouldn't work for to long or atleast it wouldn't happen over one day.|`|VBdXray0aa	I don't think I want to give up my car, electric lights and heat and a few other good things of life.

There was continual war, sickness, plague, crime, injustice, intolerance, etc.    Second, our technological structure requires maintenance, or it will collapse and cause great amounts of destruction. (i.e. Nuclear facilities must be maintained with electricity, etc.)    Third, people would turn to a state of near anarchy from being suddenly cut off from technology, because they need it so desperately.    There are small pockets of people who enjoy simple lives - people who live in rural areas, move to other countries, join or start communes, etc. Most people live for technology, though.

7eT4s1lfaa	I asked my fiance who was in the Air Force for 10 years, and he's pretty good at figuring people out and he said he has no idea what this guy could be thinking.  It's obviously some kind of riddle he himself made up, so I don't think it's going to make sense to anyone but him.  At first my fiance thought he might be referring to you as the trash he must take out as in a break up but if you said hes referring to a friend in a hospital well then that just can't be it.  I asked my fiance about the friends being the neighbors he's referring to and he said "no matter how you spin it, it just doesn't make sense" so I'm going with his answer.    I think what it boils down to is he is trying to sound smart and mysterious to you.  Of course, that is assuming he's been with you a short period of time and is trying to impress you.  In your shoes, I would ask him to stop beating around the bush and just say what he means, but that's just me and/or just let him know that that those sort of games aren't your thing.   Other than that, this is not a real riddle as far as I know.  Hope this helps.|`|AA11503678	he is insecure now  and maybe his change of life made him think weird. I am sure he is very happy with you, and try to ask him more questions to know him and what is in his brain nowadays.|`|1Ih01vPIaa	Your boyfriend is going on a covert operation, and it sounds like a dangerous one.  If something were to go wrong you will need to remember this.  They will need you to ask this question or he will ask you this question upon his return, to make sure they got the right guy.  Or to make sure you are who they say you are when identifying him.  Usually they will bring you along on a prisoner exchange mission.  You should feel honored he chose you.    I just had a thought..umm.. everyone here knows the security question and answer.  You should ask for a new one.|`|PQDNq1cUaa	i think it means that if he dies u should move on and get on with your life?|`|DQlZIzAFaa	It could be a safety/security question. For example, my mom always had a "password" for me. If someone told me that my parents were in trouble and they were sent to pick me up, I had to ask for the password. If they didn't know it, I didn't go with them, and they were kidnappers!!    Okay, moving on from the childish version, the military may have a thing similar to that. So, you're not married to him so legally you can't visit him if he's hospitalized because you're not family. But you are his SigO, so they need some way to make sure you are who you say you are and they can give you the benefits of a wife, like visitation or monetary compensation for his injuries. To know this, you need to know his "password" which is to use the neighbor's garbage can.    Honestly, I have no idea. This is just my theory. But my parents really did make me know my password. Haha.|`|3b799e3d18df0e460b9a42cf6e25aba5aa	How invested are you in this guy? His questions sound bizarre to me and the fact that he won't explain himself makes me wonder if he is either mentally ill or if he likes to play head games with you. Either of the 2 possibilities makes me think that maybe you should look for another b/f.    I know that this sounds harsh and also I hope that you have known him for a long time so that you know from experience about his character. With only the information you have given, if it was me, I would tell him to either explain himself in a reasonable way or that the relationship is over.    What kind of long term relationship can you have if he continues to treat you this way?|`|55xYyKOEaa	death is horrible believe it|`|SEVbfUyeaa	Sounds like he is planning something.  A prank??

lUe4rReZaa	Lessons are a good idea, to get started, many community colleges offer beginners classes that are fairly inexpensive, compared to private lessons.  If you want to go the self taught route get a book for beginners at a music shop.   It will show you basic chords and technic.      here are a couple of free web sites that can help out.    http://www.justinguitar.com/en/BC-001-Ch...  great for beginners, and intermediate players, it has video lessons, and does a good job of teaching theory.    http://www.chordie.com/  A great source for songs and a good community in the forums.  check out the public song books you will probably find a few that have songs for beginners that suit your personal tastes.|`|KvwVBzb0aa	My son began with lessons at a local music store and learned the basics and various styles.

Possibilities include:    Emotions -- love, grief, courage, anger, hope.  Ideals -- honesty, truth, justice, serenity, wisdom.  Archetypes -- Queen, Father, Hero, Warrior, Teacher.    A sonnet features a break between the octave and the sestet; take advantage of that to contrast different ideas, times, places, or processes in your poem.
m9bRpmN4aa	I did. It was actually a dissapointment in the end, when nothing happened with the Volturi. No fighting, no battle. It was a lead up to a safe little resolution. It's the same with the sex, I thought Stephanie was going to describe it :( but nada.    I did enjoy the whole book though, very interesting and I love the whole series. I think there should of been an epilogue, too. The ending should of had some sort of cliff hanger maybe? Nothing too dramatic and such, but something that leaves the readers wondering what happens after that, but satisfied that the book ended well.    It did end on a halt! I went straight to Stephanie's website to read her draft of Midnight Sun because I wanted to keep having my fix of Twilight and the books and everything.    Overall though, good good.      EDIT:    I actually agree with Annie on that one. Whilst reading Breaking dawn I could TELL that she was rushing when she had written it! And that she was in such a hurry to have it all completed and I knew for sure when there was so much lead up to the fight with the Volturi and then........nothing.

nQ3kFPMVaa	Yes and no. Yes, training will get you more roles than having no formal training; however, that's no guarantee at success. Most likely, this course would be a good step into a better (more recognised) course, like NIDA, VCA or WAAPA. I've not heard much about CSU courses, but a BA from there won't get you very far without a lot of other experience and an agent too.    Good for you for thinking of study first: most 15 year olds just want a role NOW and don't even think about study. I don't know what Waaga Waaga's like in terms of theatre (I've been there once for a couple of days... not exactly informed about the area), but my guess is you probably need to get involved with the local amateur group and/or make your own shows to keep up your experience.    Here's what I normally advise [EDIT: Ah hell, I see I've already given you that advise on another question, so I won't repeat myself]    Anyway, you get the idea. I would add that if you think this course will improve your skills, there's no reason *not* to take it. People underestimate the value of going to a lesser known course, and it can provide good building blocks to further education. I know a number of people who never received formal training, some who receive formal training at VCA, and some who receive formal training at 'lesser known' courses. Those who attend VCA get more roles than the other two categories, but those who take lesser known courses receive more roles than those who never take training at all. So take the chance to learn if you can.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Look-getting a degree will just get you a title. Being in a movie or anything takes real talent and more importantly-the right connections. So many people have degrees in acting and they are only doing local theatre. I think moving to a popular acting area helps. Or just networking with other actors.    A degree is a piece of paper. You need talent.|`|m2QSWdnraa	serve me coffee at starbucks hahahalolol :)|`|50zbKv0jaa	mostly things involving asking if "you want fries with that"
F7HT7glPaa	1) The four men in New Moon were just random men, but they reminded Bella of the men who cornered her when she was in Port Angeles for the first time. Also, Bella wanted the feeling of adrenaline that brought back Edward's voice.    2) In New Moon (I think it was), Jacob gave Bella conversation hearts as a Valentines joke, but Bella said she forgot to buy him a gift. Jacob said she could trade a life time of servitude for them. So in Eclipse, when Jacob asks if she remember that Valentine's day, she asks how she could forget, she traded a lifetime of slavery for a box of conversation hearts.|`|xVpkULQMaa	she stopped to look at them coz she thinks that if she's near from danger she might hear edward's voice telling her stuffs.. and she's desperate to hear him thats why.    i love new moon, makes me cry, olweiz|`|oLOtIsBzaa	They were just guys that looked kind of like the guys in Twilight who were chasing Bella because they wanted to BAD things to her (I'm not exactly sure what). That's why she gets afraid and gets adrenalin.|`|MAD7XzCraa	Ok, as for your first question, if you've read twilight, you'd remember when Bella Jessica and Angela go to port Angeles, and Bella almost gets.. well bad things were going to happen to her, these 4 men had sort of rounded her up and surrounded her in a dark alley, and then Edward swooped in and saved her, and it reminded her of that, which is why Edward's voice was there. These men were not the same 4 men, but they reminded her of them, and she originally thought that they might have been.    And the second question, well conversation hearts are sweets with hearts on them, and within the heart there is a few words, for example kiss me, or best friends, and all that. There jsut something that people get as a bit of a joke on valentines day. So Jacob gave Bella the hearts, and she said she had nothing to offer him, apart from being his slave for life.  She was obviously talking about that :)    hope i cleared things up for you, if not  just tell me what else you need help with and id be happy to help out.|`|vSTtAfOWaa	Alright remember that time back in Twilight when Bella almost gets raped by those men but Edward saves her? Well Bella and Jessica were in Port  Angeles and the guys in front of the bar in New Moon....well they probably weren't bad guys but they probably looked a little strange to Bella. They might have been drunk in front  of a bar. That is who the men reminded her of. The bad men.  Yes, Jacob brought Bella the hearts not the other way around. BUT Bella didn't buy anything for Jacob and he asked her to be his Valentine. She asked him what that meant and he said something like a life time of slavery. Or something like that.   I hope that helped!|`|m9bRpmN4aa	If you can recall, during that scene in Port Angeles, Bella feels as though she recognises the voice, because he's telling her to "Go with Jessica" and to keep back from the group when she tries to approach them, it's basically her actually hallucinating and thinking it's Edward, because in Twilight he saves her from the group of men and in New Moon it's like he is protecting her again, as he always does in a situation like that.|`|6f2c903eae4fc8a81f741a6b9dc5f770aa	bella thought one of the four was from the group of guys she was harassed by the first time she went to Port Angeles.  from 'twilight' when edward showed up out of no where and saved her.  later she meet up with jessica and angela at the restaurant, which those two already ate at.  yet she and edward got a chance to talk and then he drove her home.|`|YBL1yg5Gaa	The 4 guys are just random men but they reminded her of the first night in Port Angeles of the guys who were going to do her harm and then Edward came to save her. She kept wanting to see those guys because she thought they'd bring back memories of Edward and how he'd rush over and save her.|`|STd3geMxaa	i dunno the answer to  2...    but for the first one: the four guys reminded her of the guys in the alley last time she was in port angeles, when edward came to save her with his shiny volvo. she got major deja vu, and she wanted to go talk to them to see if edward would show up to save her again, and once she cracked he kind of did.

You think that it's only fun? It's not! It's hard,hard work in a very tough business. The odds of you doing this are 1 in 10000. What makes you so special?|`|nQ3kFPMVaa	Keep doing drama at school and in your last two years of it too (HSC, VCE, whatever your state calls it). Do extra-curricular acting classes and take part in school performance events.    A graphic designer got his kids into a commercial? Sounds like he works for an ad agency - I doubt he would or could help you.    First off, check out local auditions at theatre.asn.au, or read up on Aussietheatre.com. If you're keen, pay for a membership at QuietOnSet.com.au or Artshub.com.au; they list heaps of auditions every day around Australia. Another good site is screenhub.com.au.    My best advice is to visit the first link, head to the FAQ section, and read about finding agents in Australia, how to find work, etc. It also has a lot of stuff about dodgy Aussie agents to avoid and people have already listed recommendations there for agents. There's heaps of free info there for new actors, and is practically the best place you can find info for emerging actors. There's also a huge list of companies that you can search by suburb.     AGENTS DO NOT COST MONEY - IF THEY ASK FOR FEES UPFRONT, THEY ARE DODGY.    Visit www.alliance.org.au, the actor's union for Australia and join.    If you don't have experience don't expect a professional role or an agent. I suggest you use the next years to build up experience, and then try applying for a local uni course. Trust me, there are too many actors out there and not enough roles. Everyone wants to be in Home and Away and Neighbours; very few actually do it.    Those Aussie actors who are in Hollywood have spent the better part of 20 years developing their career - first in Australia, and then overseas. Do yourself a favour; take some classes and do some shows first.    Think about attending WAAPA, NIDA or VCA or one of the many great courses out there (there are heaps) when you're ready.     There's a lot of indie films being made in Australia, for which you can audition for without an agent; check the first link for examples, or Quiet On Set.    DON'T sign up for one of those American talent sites. They are scams and never have anything for Australian auditions

In fact, many of the most brilliant philosophers of all time have wondered about the same question ...   Unfortunately, sometimes their answers can be overly complicated and even more confusing than the question itself. (>> Heidegger for ex.)  Me, I think existence is such a fundamental concept that our minds may not be able to fully grasp it; to understand something you need to keep at a certain distance from it, but with 'existence' we're too much INTO it to understand what it really is: it's a paradox sort of like trying to see your own eyes with your own eyes!  So I have no answer to your question; now, if you're brave enough, you may consider trying to actually read how philosophers have answered your question. In that case follow the links I provided. But in any case I'll keep just 'wondering' over what existence is and I'll keep being amazed at the fact that SOMETHING exists rather than NOTHING, and i suggest you do the same!|`|WWZEUMkzaa	Existence is being able to think and doubt your own existence, by doubting you know you are thinking, and by thinking you know you exist. Cogito ergo sum.     It is not dumb at all. Man can only know reality in terms of cognitive proccess and sensitive ability. Whatever you know by the senses and by logical thinking is what exists.     In a fashion, reality only exists in human mind. The table itself is not what "exists", but the concept of table, the description you made of it. By hearing it you can mentally picture what a table is. Man has to adjust "real" reality to the structure of his own mind so he can comprehend it. We can only know reality by means of human conceptions, such as space and time, both product of the cognitive proccess. These concepts explain reality in the only humanly possible way to do it.

j5Apt8hWaa	Omega and Beseler have been the most popular enlargers used by both students and professional photo artists.    Durst was somewhat popular with amateurs and one was used in a pro lab I worked in, but it seems to have fallen off the horizon when it comes to classroom darkrooms and personal or photographers darkrooms.      I still use an Omega D2 I have had for many years and it works just as well now as it did when I bought it used nearly 20 years ago.    Since you already have your darkroom set up, all you need is your replacement enlarger, negative carriers and lenses for your various format films.    I would suggest you buy the Omega.|`|FeUmyxqqaa	get the one with the greek name|`|e185922a05d6a34cd1ab11b31d21af0baa	Great deal, I would go for the Omega enlarger. It is a fairly popular brand and there are  lots of cheap replacement parts on the used market which means it will give you years of service.  Personally if you do get the Omega, consider a cold head for it.  You can get so much more tonality from your prints with the cold head.  I have used this enlarger in the past with medium and large format printing, and I have never had any issues with it, it is simple, and if anything goes wrong, it is easy to repair.|`|EPo8P1aVaa	Go for  Simmon Omega B-8 , No second Thought on it.|`|k8AcVixTaa	I have several enlargers including two Omegas and 1 Durst.

If he/she isn't and you do not get a raise I'd start looking for another job. Also ask why you are not getting more hours so that you can make more money, life if expensive and so are school loans. STAND UP FOR YOURSELF and ASK FOR WHAT YOU NEED! I am sure you have thought of this but have you done it or are you afraid of losing your position?

pljzOzReaa	Do you mean in the current or past day?      At the time of the initial release I do not think Jim was getting very good reviews. In an interview Jim was asked about his poetry books and his reaction seemed to show that the ratings were not too good.  He mentioned how a poetry book never really sells well because of it's genre and says that he never really looked to see what the critics have said.  However, when he said this he seemed to be a little bit upset or disappointed to me; however, I am sure others will disagree.  Having said this, I do not think that the critics liked any of his poetry.     I think that there are some reasons why the critics did not like his poetry. I realize this could be a difference of opinion, but at that time the writers seemed to be pretty biased.  I think that many people shared the thought that because Jim was good looking and a rock star he was not intelligent or capable of writing something as deep as poetry.  I think that the had the initial idea that it was not going to be any good because that is what they expected.  Also, Jim had a different way of writing poetry that really doesn't rhyme (which some people insist is necessary for a poem, which I disagree with.) All in all I just think that people had their thoughts on how it was going to be or should be and would not let them go and be open minded. Don't get me wrong, I am no critic, I just see a slight level of bias in their reviews (I realize there also be bias in my statements but I try to make it contain as little opinions as possible.)    As in terms of now, I find it hard to judge.  I think that some people just "love" his poetry because they "love" Jim Morrison so much; they do not look any deeper then the person that wrote it and their like for them (I mean to say there is no analysis or thought to it.) At the same time, I think that some people dislike his poetry because he is seen as a rock star, not a literary great. I am not sure about current day critics, I think that they share the same mentality as the old ones.    In a way I think Jim's poetry has a certain level of appeal to the public that is not understood by the critics that may be more interested in the formalities and the reputation of the poem/writer.  Personally, I really like most of his poetry; however, I am not just a blind reader. There are some things I dislike and some things that I like more then others.  I wouldn't call it mundane, but I can understand in a way if other people feel differently.    Just to add, Jim took his poetry really seriously and was very involved with it, just like most artists I assume.  I think that sometimes there is a lack of respect towards his work and time because he is famous which is really a shame.
10QSTGWAaa	Coolgardie Field. See the link below for the whole story.|`|Fnp2MIycaa	1892 -  Gold found by A Bayley and J Ford at Coolgardi, Western Australia.    Coolgardie owes its existence to the discovery of gold at nearby Fly Flat in September 1892. According to all accounts the 2 prospectors credited with the discovery were Arthur Bayley and William Ford. Reports of the time indicate that on 17 September 1892 Bayley hastily reported the discovery of 554 ounces of gold to J.M. Finnerty, the then resident mining warden at Southern Cross. At the time 554 ounces of gold was worth the stupendous sum of 2200 pounds and in accordance with Western Australian mining regulations, Bailey was offered a "reward claim" covering 20 acres of land at Fly Flat. Bayley's reward claim proved to be a very profitable one indeed, and was continually worked until 1963. During the 70 years of its existence this mining claim recovered over 500,000 ounces of the precious yellow metal.

I'm reading some of his older work, "Night Shift".     If you like history, I would HIGHLY suggest "Triangle of Death" which shows how recently released CIA documents tie the assassination of JFK to the French Mafia to the Vietnam War.    If you like true crime, I would suggest "Deliberate Intent", which discusses the importance of the protection of the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution. There is a true story of a man who hired a hitman to kill his mentally ill son and wife. The hitman used a book titled something to the effect of "How to be a Hitman" by Paladin Press. The investigators found the book which led to the capture of both the hitman, and his employer. The majority of the book then discusses if it is ok for a publishing company to publish such a book. It is written by Rod Smolla, a very well known lawyer protecting the 1st amendment, but fought against the production of the book in the case. Very interesting.    Anyways, thats all I really read, so that is all I can suggest.    Good Luck.|`|YpmcXaNJaa	Here are some good authors**:  Melina Marchetta (On the Jellicoe Road, Looking For Alibrandi)  Louise Renninson (Georgia Nicolson Diaries)  Stephanie Meyer (Twilight)  J.K Rowling (Harry Potter)  Maureen MacCarthy (Chain Of Hearts)  Ann Brashares (Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants)  Jaquline M----* (Finding Cassie Crazy, Feeling Sorry For Celia)  --just some of my faveourites    *Dont know her last name, sorry  ** Mainly girl books. sorry if you are a guy..|`|dsgXLjiUaa	may bird and the ever after.

I am not sure where it is right now.    It starts when the character on a mountain,separated from his mountain climbing team, trying to survive the cold without a jacket.    He back tacks, and one of his packers finds him and helps him back to down to a point where they become separated again. But this time he is in a village. The residents change his life completely by their generosity, determination, and wisdom..    It is a true story that touched my heart.

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	Your camera is just a small "point and shoot" digital camera.  Point and shoot cameras are fine for snapshots, and you can get nice pictures.  But you won't be able to get professional level pictures.  One thing you need to keep in mind with a point and shoot camera is that you have very little manual control...you can't change the shutter speed or aperture, so there are a lot of photographic techniques that you won't be able to use.  A point and shoot camera is designed for just that..."point and shoot."  You aim the camera and press a button.  They're made to be very simple and easy to use.  That's great for snapshots, but not for when you get seriously interested in photography and you want to have more control and creativity with your pictures.<br>  <br>  So, the short answer to your question is, you will get nice pictures that you would be happy to show to your friends and relatives.  But you won't necessarily get "professional" pictures.  <br>  <br>  Just be sure there is plenty of light, and be sure you hold the camera steady.  One mistake a lot of people make, especially with digital point and shoot cameras, is that they don't have enough light, and they don't hold the camera steady.  So their pictures end up looking underexposed, pixelated, and blurry.  They think that just because it's a digital camera, the picture will magically come out perfect, or they can "fix" it on a computer later.  That's not true at all.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  You can vote thumbs-down all you want, but you're not going to get "professional" pictures with a cheap little digital point and shoot camera.  Nice pictures, yes (IF you have good lighting)...but not professional.  Otherwise, why would professional photographers even bother with expensive DSLR cameras and medium and large format film cameras, lenses, and other equipment that costs THOUSANDS of dollars...if all they had to do was use a little $100 point and shoot digital camera?  You will get nice pictures of your kids with a small point and shoot camera.  But if you want "professional" pictures, then you need an experienced and professional photographer.  Especially for portraits.  (Just so you know, Perki IS a professional photographer).  <br>  <br>  Just because you don't like the answers you're being given, that doesn't change the fact that it's true.  You'll get nice pictures with your camera, but NOT "professional."|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	If the person with the Point and Shoot understands the camera, the lighting and composition,it is highly possible to take a professional looking image with that camera.<br>  <br>  I took this with a three mega pixel point and shoot years ago. I was mindful of the lighting and surroundings. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/perki88/390244575/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/perki88/390...</a>|`|yCU47Zskaa	Saying that you can just get a camera and take a work of art is like saying that you can take a paint brush and create a Vincent van Gogh painting. People don't just become instantly really good at photography. It's takes practice and perseverance to become a good photographer. It also takes knowing about shutter speed, exposure, composition and other things that go into making great works of art. But, I'm positive that if you work hard at photography and say with it you will someday have wonderful works of art. Just don't plain on it happening over night.|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	Since the camera is going to do most of the mechanical stuff automatically, the most important thing that you need to study is composition, or framing.  There are some "rules," but you really don't have to follow them.  Your camera is fine, my son shoots incredible shots with a point and shoot.  <br>  <br>  So, go to the library and look up a photography book and study framing and lighting.  By lighting, I don't mean that you have to use studio lights, just work with available light, the sun, other light sources, etc.  I always recommended people who were studying photography to look at Rembrandt's work, not because I wanted the interested in Rembrandt, but because he always presents his subjects with an interesting light source.|`|i5OVORXgaa	Professionals know how to control their camera! The Kodak EasyShare is a point and shoot, which doesn't allow you to have very much control. If you know how to control the camera, then a DSLR would be a good choice... no need to buy a DSLR if you're just going to use it on auto though.<br>  <br>  Also, it's not just the camera that makes a professional photo... it's the photographer! Work on lighting and composition.

Another could be psychological effects on a person who keeps emotions bottled up (depression, antisocial behavior, lashing out), as well as discussing the importance of Melinda and her art.

cc3b50c15188a21b6354387ed6888f48aa	In my opinion, as long as you don't have anything else on the wall... the bigger, the better. I love seeing one huge piece of art on an otherwise blank/empty wall.<br>  <br>  That's just my preference, though. <br>  <br>  Here's an idea - try looking around your house for different sized posters, calenders, etc - just a bunch of things that are different sizes. Temporarily hang them on your wall (where you plan to position the photo) & take a few steps back to look. That may help you decide on a general size.|`|i5OVORXgaa	Depends on how big your room is and how much wall space you have... typical poster sizes range from 18x24 to 24x36.

7cb53322e811e94587e2d86d0b26c7beaa	These books don't have any genre in common, although there is a theme of violence and/or fantasy.     A Clockwork Orange: scifi/fantasy (unclassifiable really, but let's say scifi/horror)  Fahrenheit 451: scifi/fantasy (a pretty standard science fiction book from the so-called "golden age" of science fiction)  Harry Potter- scifi/fantasy (standard fantasy)  Catch-22: war/comedy/satire.  very clever book.  Macbeth: Shakespeare.     based on your picks, I would go for the following.    Brave New World by Aldous Huxley - dystopian scifi  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K Dick- dystopian scifi  Ubik by Philip K Dick - freaky weird scifi  Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut (dystopian scifi)  Weaveworld by Clive Barker - fantasy horror  The Stand by Stephen King - dystopian fantasy horror  Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkein. It has all the drama and gravitas of MacBeth, plus lots of war, and it's a fantasy. It's *really* long though and takes a while to get going, but once you're in you won't put it down.  Neuromancer- dystopian scifi thriller    all of these are bestselling, popular and critically acclaimed.

pI5jKfmaaa	Aftermath of world war2:  Although hostilities came to an end in Sept., 1945, a new world crisis caused by the postwar conflict between the USSR and the United Statesthe two chief powers to emerge from the warmade settlement difficult. By Mar., 1950, peace treaties had been signed with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland; in 1951, the Allies (except the USSR) signed a treaty with Japan, and, in 1955, Austria was restored to sovereignty. Germany, however, remained dividedfirst between the Western powers and the USSR, then (until 1990) into two German nations .       Despite the birth of the United Nations, the world remained politically unstable and only slowly recovered from the incalculable physical and moral devastation wrought by the largest and most costly war in history. Soldiers and civilians both had suffered in bombings that had wiped out entire cities. Modern methods of warfaretogether with the attempt of Germany to exterminate entire religious and ethnic groups (particularly the Jews)famines, and epidemics, had brought death to tens of millions and made as many more homeless. The suffering and degradation of the wars victims were of proportions that passed the understanding of those who had been spared. The conventions of warfare had been violated on a large scale (see war crimes), and warfare itself was revolutionized by the development and use of nuclear weapons.       Political consequences included the reduction of Britain and France to powers of lesser rank, the emergence of the Common Market (see European Economic Community; European Union), the independence of many former colonies in Asia and Africa, and, perhaps most important, the beginning of the cold war between the Western powers and the Communist-bloc nations.|`|heF3HIzQaa	The dominos had started to fall.    1) The Japanese, despite losing the war, had demonstrated that Europeans were not invincible. Non-Europeans could defeat them.    2) Britain had already promised India independence in return for support in WW2, and if India, why not Africa?    3) Both France and Britain were broke and unwilling to spend large sums maintaining an Empire.    4) VERY IMPORTANT. The USA was opposed to colonialism and would not support Empires. The right of nations to self-determination was asserted both at Yalta and in the founding documents of the new UN.    5) The coming of age of a new generation of African leaders, many of whom were educated or influenced by the West.|`|mDU9EwxZaa	The large majority of Africa was part of two empires -- the British and the French.

3I2H3wMAaa	I have played both and taught guitar professionally. I got many of my teaching ideas from piano books.    If you want to learn music learn piano. It's a lot of work to learn either instrument. Eventually you need to understand scales and music theory in some shape or form and many other things as well.    Guitar can hurt your fingers. Steel string (my favorite but ouch!), nylon string classical (very pretty, nice, technical), electric (easier on the fingers, fast paced).    But if your dad is a guitarist then you have a major head start in either one and especially guitar.    Which one do you have a desire for? Are you expecting to play music all your life? Do you want to just play music or do you want to really understand it?     If you really want to learn and understand MUSIC, piano is probably the way to go. If you just want to learn an instrument then take your pick.    Whichever you choose I'm sure you will enjoy it!    Very happy for you.    Be blessed.|`|KvwVBzb0aa	Guitar first then piano. You are lucky to have both available, take advantage of it and learn both, then you can decide which you prefer.|`|kpi69PHWaa	As a Billy Joel fan, I have to say piano.|`|8YLgGtQqaa	Guitar, most definitely.  Because, you get to move around when you are playing it or sit down if you choose.  But, a piano, you always have to sit.|`|of1dkoFtaa	How about learning both they're both equally fun and rewarding|`|xFdz9CMKaa	Learn piano if you're the type of guy who wants to take a girl out to dinner.  Learn guitar if you just wanna get laid.|`|44Kn5G95aa	We cannot make this decision for you.  It's all up to you.  Just pick one.|`|t9abodi3aa	Learn piano first because it will make theory easier once you begin guitar. But in my opinion guitar is more fun and you have a greater ability to express yourself and use your instrument as a voice. I play both by the way.|`|FQ3FwoMmaa	Well piano is easier but guitar is portable. Guitar gives you calluses on your fingers and piano doesn't. I play both and i would have to say piano is better because it is faster to learn and I think it is funner.

r8drw5Dcaa	They said the war was pretty much over before the Bomb.<br>  Yeah I know a lot of people said it would have cost a lot of American lives, but the thing is the Japanese were running out of supplies, we could have waited them out.<br>  So I'm guessing USA government wanted to see their new toy in action, that pretty much was the only reason to use it.<br>  <br>  1. It wouldn't have changed the out come of the war.<br>  2. Had we not used it, we would have had another war right after it, probably with the Russians.<br>  3. The USA would have been seen as sissy's for not using it, and someone would have used it on us.|`|AA12095483	The world wouldn't be appreciably different, because the Allies were going to win the war in any case - but the war would have gone on for considerably longer than it did, had the Abomb not been used. <br>  The US would not be any different - nor would any of the other Allied countries.|`|O7w6XGqPaa	A longer drawn out war, maybe ending in 1948. Millions of Japanese would have died of starvation and exposure and their attendant diseases with all railroads wrecked and coastal and foreign shipping impossible from sea mines and submarines. That meant no way to get food and fuel to the cities.<br>  Several millions more would have died from direct combat causes. If we had  used poison gas, the Army estimate was five million Japanese dead from that cause alone.<br>  The Soviet Union would have occupied northern Japan. <br>  Millions of more people in Japanese occupied China and other areas of Asia would have died from abuse and neglect.<br>  Japan would have murdered all western POWs and civilian internees as soon as American forces landed in the home islands. <br>  <br>  The US would have been embittered by a long drawn out war. There might even have been mutinies in the armed forces, weary for peace.|`|9okusH1kaa	1) The War in the Pacific would have continued on for a longer time, but not that much longer. The US only used 10% of their military power against the Japanese because the Germans were a much more serious threat. The Americans would have had to invade the islands of Japan, which would have been costly, but when the time the European veterans arrived they would have stomped all over the Japanese due to having longer combat records than the average Pacific soldier and sheer numbers. Japan would have been utterly destroyed by the end of the war and many, many more people, mostly Japanese citizens, would be dead. We would have executed the Emperor and actually gone after Japanese war criminals for their crimes instead of giving them get out of jail free cards. Japan may have attempted to utilize biological weapons, which would have been devastating to the populace.<br>  <br>  2) The Cold War would have probably gone hot. Most of the major events would have different timelines. With America tied up in the Pacific, Russia might have invaded a shattered Europe with little but the English military and the scraps of the German military to oppose it. (Gen. Patton had been training the German POWs for that) We likely would have subjugated Japan more thouroughly, in order to use their land as a forward Eastern base in a war against Russia. By modern times? No way of knowing. Assuming the cold war stayed mostly cold, it might be very similar but with a different timeline for all major events. If there was constant war and no nukes ever dropped? Much different. <br>  <br>  3) Depends on far too many variables to actually know. Any number of things could be different.|`|jwo2Cj7maa	1.  WWII would have gone on longer and the U.S. invasion of Japan from that point would have been drawn out and bloody on both sides.<br>  2.  If the U.S. was successful in taking over Japan, there would have a period of time in Japan of more predominant U.S. occupation.<br>  3.  The United States might have many more Japanese people immigrate to our country in much the same way that many Indians immigrated to the UK after their occupation of India.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	We wouldn't have felt the guilt we did after the war and spent so much money setting them up again.<br>  We'd still be giants in the auto industry.|`|pS8HhQkdaa	Very interesting question. I predict if we didn't drop the atomic bomb on japan then the war may even still be going on today. This could cause world famine, and hunger, plus Europe would lie in ruins, Maybe the Japanese would invade America...and it would all go down hill from there. Hope this helps!

77e87a292029be0adec952f9539afd9caa	Sicher wei?t du so ungef?hr, was Revolution im Fach Geschichte bedeutet. Eine Gruppe von Unzufriedenen erhebt sich gegen die geltenden politischen oder gesellschaftlichen Verh?ltnisse, es wird gek?mpft, diskutiert, ein Umsturz herbeigeführt - kurz: ein neues System entsteht, neue Grunds?tze werden festgelegt, die Menschen beruhigen sich wieder und du musst nun die Jahreszahlen solcher Geschehnisse lernen und die Biographien der Revolutionsanführer studieren. Und das soll die Geschichte einer Revolution sein? Du merkst, etwas sehr Entscheidendes fehlt da. <br>  <br>  Es fragte sich einmal ein berühmter deutscher Dichter folgendes: "Ist es m?glich, dass die ganze Weltgeschichte missverstanden worden ist? Ist es m?glich, dass die Vergangenheit [so wie wir sie kennen] falsch ist, weil man immer von ihren Massen gesprochen hat, gerade, als ob man von einem Zusammenlauf vieler Menschen erz?hlte, statt von dem Einen ... ?" Nun ahnst du sicherlich, warum eine Revolution doch nicht so einfach in Zahlen und wissenschaftlichen Beschreibungen abgehandelt werden kann, warum eine Revolution wie die Franz?sische vor ca. 210 Jahren mehr sein muss als ein Stapel trockener Tatsachen in irgendeines Wissenschaftlers verkramtem Studierzimmer... Es sind Frauen und M?nner, Kinder und Jugendliche, die die Franz?sische Revolution miterlebten, Menschen, für die sich so vieles ver?nderte, dass ihre Nachfahren noch in unserer Zeit am Datum der Revolution einen Feiertag begehen. <br>  <br>  Allgemein gesagt sind die Ver?nderungen (gesellschaftlicher, politischer, kultureller, mentaler Art) so tiefschürfend gewesen, dass sie noch heute die Grundlage für das gemeinsame und ?ffentliche Leben nicht nur in Europa bilden. Diese beiden Aspekte - der Mensch w?hrend der Revolution und die Auswirkungen auf unsere Kultur - sollen daher die Hauptsache in der Behandlung dieses Themas darstellen. <br>  <br>  Der Eingangsworte seien aber jetzt genug gewechselt, ihr wollt nun endlich Taten sehen, oder? Daher sollt ihr jetzt Gérard kennen lernen, einen junger Mann (kaum ?lter als ihr), der die Revolution miterlebt und mitgestaltet hat. Durch Gérards Tagebuchaufzeichnungen k?nnt ihr nun eintauchen in jene wilden Zeiten, als Freiheit und Gleichheit noch nicht selbst-verst?ndlich waren. <br>  <br>   1788<br>   Es ist doch ein Leid. Da steht man vor einer Boulangerie, bis die Abendsonne den Himmel erglühen l?sst ohne etwas rechtes in die Finger zu bekommen. Man arbeitet Tag um Tag, und es ist harte Arbeit die wir verrichten, doch wozu führt's? Die angesammelten Besitztümer müssen feilgeboten werden, das t?gliche Einkommen geht fast ganz für einen Laib Brot daher... Und was für ein Brot ist das! Von unappetitlicher Farbe, hart wie Stein und entsetzlich im Geschmack. Nicht nur Adèle treibt's die Bl?sse ins Gesicht. Und die Umst?nde durch welche man das Brot zu erlangen hat! Vor der Boulangerie dr?ngen, nein prügeln sich die Menschen um den Eintritt, t?glich und überall gibt's ein eingeschlagenes Gesicht, eine blutige Nase oder einen gebrochenen Arm zu beklagen. Gestern kam Maman mit einer Platzwunde an der würdevollen Stirne und sonst auch gar zu zerzaust nach Hause; nur einen Knust hatte sie ergattern k?nnen. Gerade Maman, die doch Menschenansammlungen so hasst und sich über der Leute Unsitten mokiert. Es muss sich einiges ?ndern, das steht fest. <br>  <br>  Viel haben wir gearbeitet, meine Familie und ich. Papa hat das Unternehmen aufgebaut, Adèle und ich gehen regelm??ig zur Arbeit, wir zahlen Steuern (die wei? Gott nicht niedrig sind) an die Hohen im Staate... Eine vergleichsweise gute Bildung haben wir genossen, selbst Adèle. Als M?dchen ist es nicht so einfach, an eine gute Bildung zu gelangen, aber Vater hat sich für Adèle eingesetzt und so konnte auch sie eine kleine private Schule besuchen. Wir sind nun gebildet, einigerma?en verm?gend; unsereins geh?rt zu den vorantreibenden Kr?ften in Paris. Wer sind die hohen Leute, dass sie sich im Rechte dünken, wenn sie uns übergehen, uns, die wir doch Kern des Staates sind. Der Adel kann nicht ohne uns sein, unsere Steuern und Abgaben sind der hohen Leute überlebensmittel... Wie kann es dann aber sein, dass man uns nicht an den Parlements teilnehmen l?sst, dass man uns arbeiten und Abgaben leisten l?sst, ja, dass man Kriege und andere zwielichtige Unternehmen mit unserem Gelde führt ohne dass wir ein Wort zu sagen haben? <br>  <br>  Und sieht man erst die Armen, die Handwerker, Arbeiter, Tagel?hner und Diener! Ihr Einkommen und ihr Besitztum ist so viel geringer als das Unsrige. Wie soll damit das t?glich Brot bezahlt, gar eine Familie ern?hrt werden? Wie k?nnen sie von ihrer Not sagen, wenn man sie nicht h?ren will? <br>  <br>  Immer wieder geht es um ?ffentliche Angelegenheiten; die Politik ist überall; auf den Stra?en, auf dem Schlachtfeld vor den B?ckereien, am Arbeitsort, in der Familie; sie treibt die Menschen aus den H?usern, l?sst sie Stunden lang an den Fenster ausharren, begierig, Neuigkeiten aus dem gesch?ftigen Treiben in den Stra?en herauszufiltern. überall gehen Flugbl?tter um, in denen gro?e Geister zu Widerstand aufrufen. Es sind gro?e Worte, die sie führen, ungeheuerliche Anliegen, die sie vorbringen. Es erscheint alles so unwirklich, als ob die Welt auf dem Kopfe stünde. Vom dritten Stande ist dort die Rede, der Jahrhunderte lang von den oberen St?nden, dem Adel und den Kirchenleuten ausgenommen und tyrannisiert worden sei. Dabei sei er zahlenm??ig doch den ersten St?nden haushoch überlegen. Doch wohin geh?re ich, geh?rt meine Familie, unser Umfeld? Zu jenen armen Teufeln kann ich uns nicht dazurechnen, das w?re unfair, bedenkt man doch, dass wir gar nicht so unverm?gend sind. Unsere Zugeh?rigkeit zum Klerus oder zum Adel ist ebenfalls ausgeschlossen. Wir geh?ren scheinbar einer Menschengruppe an, die schwierig einzuordnen ist. Einige Flugschriftverfasser nennen uns die "Bürger". Da wir jedoch keinem Stand so recht anzugeh?ren scheinen, so sind wir doch existent und haben Recht auf Mitsprache. Egalité, Fraternité und Liberté sind die Schlagw?rter, die siele Flugblattschreiber einbringen. Gro?e Denker wie Rousseau oder Sieyes haben eine Art kollektives Menschenbild geschaffen, gültig für jeden Menschen, egal welchem Stande er entspringt. Da hat selbst seine Exzellenz der K?nig von Frankreich dieselben Rechte und Pflichten wie unsereins... <br>  <br>  Es ist, als h?tte man die Menschen aufgeweckt aus einem tiefen M?rchenschlaf - pl?tzlich redet alle Welt von Gleichheit und Freiheit, von Dingen, an die vorher niemand dachte (oder niemand laut dachte). Eigentlich sind es ja einleuchtende Erkenntnisse, wenn man l?nger darüber nachdenkt. Warum sollte jemand über mir stehen, der auch nur aus Fleisch und Blut und Leben besteht? <br>   1789<br>  Ein neuer Schreck l?uft durch Paris, springt von Mund zu Mund, sitzt in jedem Café: Die Neuigkeit, dass der Staat bankrott sei, geht um. Man sagt, dass der K?nig und seine M?nner die Einnahmen und Ausgaben falsch kalkuliert haben, sodass nun wieder einmal die Ausgaben die Einnahmen überschreiten. Dazu kommt, dass man keine Geldverleiher mehr aufzutreiben vermag; jene haben das Vertrauen endgültig verloren. Wie konnte es dazu kommen? Im Café Impérial sagen sie, dass des K?nigs verschwenderische Hofhaltung der Grund sei. Heute Morgen in der Boulangerie jedoch hielt man die letzten verlorenen Schlachten für die Hauptursache. Eine Kombination aus beidem mag der Wahrheit am N?chsten kommen. Auch die Zinsen, die der verschuldete Staat zahlen muss werden eine Rolle spielen. Was nun geschehen soll, hat mich Adèle vorhin gefragt. Ich wusste es nicht und kann es jetzt nur ahnen. Man wird die Geldpolitik ?ndern müssen, wahrscheinlich droht auch uns eine neue Steueranhebung, die wir nicht verkraften k?nnten. <br>  <br>   H?rt, h?rt, wieder hagelt es Neuigkeiten. Seine Exzellenz der K?nig von Frankreich hat sich dazu durchgerungen, die Generalst?nde wieder einzuberufen. Wenn mich nicht alles t?uscht, ist jene Versammlung seit 1614 nicht mehr zusammen getroffen. Aber es bedarf der Generalst?nde, um eine Steuerreform durchzuführen, und die h?lt der K?nig für unausweichlich. Statt des h?fischen Aufwand-Treibens zu entsagen, bittet seine Exzellenz nun uns wieder einmal verst?rkt zur Kasse... Papa hat darüber heute solch einen Wutanfall bekommen, dass dem alten Herrn eine Ader in der Nase platzte. Maman hat geschimpft und Adèle geweint. Eine h?ssliche Zukunft ist das! <br>  <br>  Emp?rung ist in der Leute Gesichter zu lesen, blanke Emp?rung und Wut. In den Generalst?nden streitet man sich um das Abstimmungsprinzip - nach Vertretern oder nach St?nden. Die feinen Herren aus dem ersten Stande verlangen natürlich eine Abstimmung nach St?nden - da k?nnen sie ihren Einfluss auf den Klerus gelten machen, und ein zwei-zu-eins-Ergebnis erpressen. Stimmte man nach K?pfen ab, so f?nden sich sicherlich viele Kirchenmenschen, die die Ungerechtigkeiten eins?hen und auf unsere Seite tr?ten. Die Macht der Oberen ist nur noch sch?dlich für die Nation: Sie verwirtschaften das Land und treiben einen jeden in die Armut. Dazu nehmen sie uns aus wie gebackene Wildg?nse. Unsere Forderungen sind eindeutig: Wir brauchen eine nationale Vertretung, die über Steuern und Gesetze entscheidet, au?erdem gew?hlte St?nde in den Provinzen, die die Verwaltung übernehmen und natürlich Freiheit der Person und der Presse. Niemand soll uns sagen k?nnen, was wir zu denken und zu sprechen haben. Je l?nger man darüber nachdenkt, desto selbstverst?ndlicher scheinen unsere Forderungen. <br>  <br>  20. Juni<br>   Endlich eine gute Nachricht: Nachdem die Generalst?nde zu nichts geführt haben, wurde eine eigene Versammlung vom dritten Stande gegründet, die sich Nationalversammlung nennt. Die Nationalversammlung hat das Recht für sich beansprucht, über Steuern zu entscheiden. Au?erdem soll eine Verfassung entstehen, ein Papier, auf dem alle Rechte und Pflichten eines jeden Bürgers festgehalten sein sollen. Und es kommt noch besser: Die Kirchenmenschen haben sich bereit erkl?rt, mit uns darüber zu verhandeln. Doch wer spukt wieder einmal dazwischen? Der Adel natürlich, mit einer sofortigen Aufl?sungsanordnung der Versammlung. Aber unsere M?nner halten dagegen, indem sie einfach in einem Ballhaus weiter tagen. Papa, der sehr viel von den neuen Entwicklungen h?lt, konnte alles beobachten - dicht gedr?ngt mit anderen neugierigen stand er an den Fenstern und folgte den Verhandlungen wenn auch nicht zuh?rend so doch zuschauend... Leidenschaft sei in der Redner Bewegungen gewesen, wei? er zu berichten. Bald sei einer aus der Menge aufgestanden, auf einen Stuhl geklettert und habe wild gestikulierend gesprochen, bald habe ein anderer mit ruhigen Bewegungen der Menge Zustimmung gesucht. Fast alle seien mit rauschendem Beifall bedacht worden, man habe die Redner in die Arme geschlossen, sie herumgereicht und bejubelt. Zukunft sei in ihren Gesichtern gewesen, Brüderlichkeit in ihren Gesten... Viele h?tten Tr?nen in den Augen gehabt, als die Menge die Finger zum Schwur erhob. Man habe n?mlich geschworen (und das sei sp?ter an die ?ffentlichkeit gedrungen) nicht auseinander zu gehen, bevor man eine Verfassung aufgestellt h?tte. "Gérard", sagte mein Vater, "Gérard, ein neues Gefühl geht durch die Menschen - Identit?t, Zugeh?rigkeit zu einer Nation der Brüderlichkeit und Einheit steht in Aussicht." Maman und Adèle hatte er zur Feier des Tages Schmuck mitgebracht - er hatte es zu einem günstigen Kurs mit Livres bezahlt, denn wer braucht schon Schmuck in diesen Tagen? Vater schien jedoch wie neugeboren, er schien ganz in seiner neu gefundenen Identit?t aufzugehen.<br>  Maman und Adèle nahmen die Geschenke schweigend entgegen - sie glauben noch nicht an Besserung. Und tats?chlich ist der Brotpreis noch nicht gesunken und die Lebensmittelknappheit macht uns nach wie vor das t?gliche Leben schwer. Und ist nicht auch noch der K?nig und der Adel da, der sich drohend ge?u?ert hat? <br>  <br>  9. Juli<br>  Man sagt, der K?nig habe die Forderungen der Nationalversammlung akzeptiert und die ersten St?nde zur Teilnahme an der Nationalversammlung aufgefordert. Papa hielt dies sogleich für eine Finte, er wetterte gegen den betrügerischen K?nig und den falschen Adel. Adèle hatte einen jungen Mann mit nach Hause gebracht; er ist ein junger Kaufmann, neunzehn Jahre alt (also zwei Jahre ?lter als sie), der ein extremer Anh?nger der Revolution ist und sich vor einiger Zeit dem politischen Club der Jakobiner angeschlossen hat. Er war der festen überzeugung, dass der K?nig ganze Menschenmengen umzubringen gedenke. Man plane, ganze Viertel in Paris sterben zu lassen, die Soldaten führen dann Gewehre und Kanonen auf, das Pariser Pflaster erzittere und die Sommerluft würde von Kugeln durchbohrt, erz?hlte er mit rollenden Augen. Papa hielt das allerdings für eines jener wilden Gerüchte, die zurzeit in Paris kursieren.<br>  Ob Gerücht oder nicht: Es wir viel Tumult geben wenn nicht schnellstens Klarheit geschaffen wird. Und tats?chlich scheint die Information gesichert, dass k?nigliche Truppenverb?nde aus dem Umland nach Paris aufbr?chen. <br>  <br>  12. Juli<br>  "Zu den Waffen, zu den Waffen!" - die Schreie wehten aus dem Garten des Palais Royal heute Morgen. Der Redner stand auf einem Tisch, eine Pistole schwenkend. Schnell eilte ich herbei; die Menschenmassen riefen wild durcheinander, immer wieder h?rte ich den Namen Neckers, unseres besten Verbündeten pro revolutio im Kabinette des K?nigs. Da schallte es mir entgegen, dass er entlassen sei, zusammen mit einigen weiteren Reformorientierten aus des K?nigs engem Umfelde... Da durchzuckte auch mich der Gedanke, dass eine Gegenrevolution im Gange sei - man verschwur sich offensichtlich gegen die neu gefundene Nation. Pl?tzlich fühlte ich mich eins mit den brüllenden und schimpfenden Menschen, wir waren eine gro?e Einheit, ein Volk... <br>  <br>  13. Juli<br>  Ein Ger?usch elektrisiert Paris, man h?rt es überall in den Rues widerhallen, ein dumpfes Stampfen, ein tiefes Grollen... Man fühlt den Ton durch die W?nde dringen, ein Auf und Ab, Gl?ser und Schüsseln beginnen leise zu klirren, eine angespannte Stille produziert dieser Ton, als ob sich irgendwo tief unter Paris ein Riese regte und zum Durchbrechen der Erdoberfl?che ansetzte... Irgendetwas regt er auch in mir, ein neuartiges Gefühl, dass ich noch nie vorher gespürt habe. Bürgerliche Milizion?re (denn vor allem die sind es, die mit ihren Schritten dieses m?chtige Ger?usch hervorbringen) streifen an unserem Haus vorbei, ihnen folgen unz?hlige Zivilisten. Die bürgerliche Miliz ist erst vor kurzer Zeit entstanden, ihre Gründung ging einher mit der Umschichtung der Stadtverwaltung. Jeder Pariser Distrikt hat seine Wahlm?nner, die einen st?ndigen Ausschuss bilden und diese Vertreter hatten mehrheitlich die Aufstellung einer solchen Miliz zur Wahrung der ?ffentlichen Sicherheit beschlossen. Deutlich ist jedoch zu spüren, dass diese seltsame neue Spannungswelle nicht von den vergleichsweise kleinen Milizgruppen ausgeht - die Menschen um mich herum ver?ndern sich; sie tuscheln miteinander oder emp?ren sich laut über Politik wenn sie sich unbelauscht wissen. Ja, es sind die "normalen" Bürger, die sich ver?ndert haben. Ein neues, kollektives Gefühl scheint Ann?herung zwischen den Menschen zu forcieren. Ein seltsamer, neuer Eindruck ist das: Fremde Menschen blicken einander im Vorübergehen fest in die Augen, der morgendliche H?ndedruck mit den Kollegen dauert ein Qu?ntchen einer Sekunde l?nger als sonst, die Leute verbringen lange Zeit auf den Stra?en. Die Unruhe, die sich schon seit l?ngerer Zeit in Paris eingenistet hat, ist zu schwelender Wut geworden. <br>  <br>  Der Sieg ist unser! Wir sind die Nation! Es lebe Liberté, Egalité und Fraternité! Das Volk hat seine überlegenheit über die ersten St?nde bewiesen! Was ist das für ein Tag gewesen! Ich bin kaum aufgestanden heute Morgen, als das Getrappel und Gerenne drau?en immer lauter und anhaltender wird. Gro?e Menschenmengen ziehen schreiend an der Türe vorbei, der Strom will nicht abrei?en. Schnell mache auch ich mich auf den Weg; es scheint einiges im Gange zu sein. Ich lasse mich vom wilden Strome mitrei?en, bald schon erfahre ich, dass der Anführer der neuen Bürgergarde, Monsieur Lafayette Waffen für seine Soldaten verlangt, die man ihm offiziell nicht zubilligen will. Die emp?rte Menge str?mt also zum Invalidenhotel, wo man viele Gewehre vorr?tig wei?. Dort angekommen, dr?ngt die Menge sogleich durch die ge?ffneten Türen; die k?niglichen Truppen in ihrer l?cherlichen Unterzahl, k?nnen nichts gegen uns ausrichten. Was ist das für eine Welle, die durch die Menge lief, als die ersten wieder mit Gewehren an den Türen erscheinen! Der schnelle Erfolg l?sst uns erschauern, des Volkes Machtgefühl ist an seinem H?hepunkt angelangt... Und schon ruft es überall: "Auf zur Bastille", denn dort sollen gro?e Pulvervorr?te untergebracht sein. Eine Eisesk?lte durchl?uft mich augenblicklich - ich erinnere mich meiner Kindheit, als Maman mir zuerst von jener Hochburg der Grausamkeiten erz?hlte. Gegner des K?nigs würden dort in ewiges Dunkel gesperrt, H?ftlinge systematisch zu Tode gehungert und Menschen von verschiedensten Insekten aufgefressen werden... Doch die Menge tr?gt mich fort, rei?t mich mit in ihrem Strom von Wut und Wahn. Und aus Angst wird Grimm, aus Kindheitserinnern Zukunftsdünkel.  Als wir die drohenden Mauern, die düsteren Schie?scharten und die m?chtigen Türme zu Gesicht bekommen, steigert sich der Ingrimm der Menschen - doch was ist zu tun? Bald kommt die Nachricht, dass sich der Gouverneur weigert, Festung und Pulver zu übergeben, er habe jedoch die Kanonen zurückgezogen und die Zusicherung gegeben, dass er nicht schie?en werde, falls er nicht angegriffen würde. Bis dahin ist die Volksmenge, die aus der Rue Saint-Antoine in die Festung gestr?mt war, erst in den ?u?eren der beiden H?fe eingedrungen, von dem aus man zur gro?en Zugbrücke und zum Haupttor der Bastille kommt. Der ?u?ere Hof ist wie immer unbewacht. Als der Gouverneur glaubt, es würde nun ein frontaler Angriff erfolgen, l?sst er schie?en. Noch nie habe ich so ein Geheul und solch ein Chaos erlebt - von den unsrigen fallen Mehrere getroffen nieder, alles rennt, nach Deckung suchend, man trampelt und rempelt, kurz: es ist wie in der H?lle. Nach dem Chaos tritt verwirrte Stille ein; ich halte mich mit einer Gruppe junger Handwerker ein wenig abseits und kann nun aus sicherer Distanz beobachten, wie die hartgesottenen K?mpfer aus unseren Reihen erneut Stellung beziehen, ja, sie schieben sogar eine Kanone aus dem Invalidenhotel heran. Stunden der Anspannung folgen, in denen nichts Wirkliches geschieht - die Belagerer harren aus w?hrend sich die Belagerten nicht zeigen. Nur noch wenige Gefangene werden in der Bastille festgehalten, sagt man. Haupts?chlich handelt es sich dabei um geistig Verwirrte. Vielerlei Geschichten gibt es über die "Letzten der Bastille"... Pl?tzlich breitet sich die Neuigkeit aus, dass der Gouverneur die Festung freig?be unter der Bedingung, dass den Soldaten nichts gesch?he. Ein wütendes Brummen geht durch die Menge; man will von Bedingungen nichts h?ren. Auch dann nicht, als der nun seinerseits ver?rgerte Gouverneur mit der Sprengung der Festung droht. Dessen verzweifeltes Gebaren wird bald zum Spott der Leute, und tats?chlich ist es lustig mit anzusehen, wenn die Leute seine Geb?rden und Grimassen nachmachen. Doch dann wird die Menge pl?tzlich still. Irgendetwas hat die Aufmerksamkeit der Menschen auf sich gezogen. Es ist unheimlich, wenn so eine gro?e Menschen ganz, ganz still ist - man h?rt das eigene Herzklopfen, man spürt die Spannung der anderen, der dringende Wunsch, allein zu sein, aus dem Machtbereich der Menge heraus zu geraten, dr?ngt sich auf.<br>  Nun vernehme auch ich es, das Ger?usch aus dem Inneren der Bastille, was die Menschen anh?lt, einzuhalten. Ein seltsames, misst?nendes Quietschen ist zu vernehmen, ein haarstr?ubender Laut. Die Menge beginnt sich erst aus der Erstarrung zu l?sen, als sich die Hauptzugbrücke langsam herabzusenken beginnt... Die geballten Emotionen mehrerer spannungsreicher Stunden wallen nach diesem Stillstand so pl?tzlich wieder auf, dass die Menge in gewaltsamen St??en, in ekstatischen Zuckungen auf die Festung eindringt. Schon sind die ersten über der Brücke, es wird geschossen, gerempelt, getreten. Die wenigen Soldaten, auch der Gouverneur wollen entkommen, man packt sie, schl?gt sie, misshandelt sie - der Groll eines aus Unterdrückung befreiten Volkes richtet sich auf diese armen Würmer...<br>  Die Menge überschwemmt f?rmlich die Bastille, man dringt überall ein, zerst?rt, ramponiert, plündert, brennt,... Die ganze Unsicherheit der letzten Jahre, die Wut der Unterdrückten, die Armut der Ausgenommenen, der Grimm der Tyrannisierten - die angestauten Emotionen werden an diesem einen Objekt gewaltsam abgebaut. Ersch?pft kehre ich heim, der Siegesl?rm dr?hnt in meinen Ohren. Ich habe mich noch nie so machtvoll, so gro?, so selbstbewusst gefühlt. Wir sind die Nation, nicht die mickrigen Laffen aus den oberen St?nden. <br>  <br>  17. Juli<br>  Papa murrte nur etwas vom "niederen P?bel" als ich ihm die Geschichte des Sturms auf die Bastille beschrieb. Wahrscheinlich ?rgerte er sich, nicht dabei gewesen zu sein. Dafür hatte aber auch er Einiges zu berichten: Man hatte n?mlich einen revolution?ren Stadtrat einberufen, dessen Oberhaupt Monsieur Bailly ist. Ferner wurde eine nationale Garde unter La Fayettes Führung gebildet die Blau-wei?-rote Kokarden tragen. Papa h?lt diese Ver?nderungen für wichtiger - unserem Sieg über die Bastille misst er nur symbolische Bedeutung zu. Natürlich kann er nicht abstreiten, dass die Entwicklungen um die Bastille die Nationalversammlung ganz sch?n zu den erw?hnten Entscheidungen angespornt haben. Ganz anders dagegen Adèles neuer Freund: Dem kamen die Tr?nen, als er mich von dem Sturm auf die Bastille reden h?rte... Papa duldet ihn eigentlich nur im Hause, weil er sich so viel mit ihm über Politik unterhalten kann - Maman findet die Beziehung zwischen ihm und Adèle gar nicht so schicklich. Aber das ist eben Maman. <br>  <br>  Lange Zeit habe ich nicht geschrieben - dabei ist so viel passiert. Nach jenen beeindruckenden Tagen um den 14. Juli verst?rkte sich die Angst wieder, der Adel k?nne eine fatale Gegenrevolution starten und die neue Nation in ihrem Entstehungsprozess bereits zerst?ren. Diese ?ffentliche Angst und der Druck der Massen (vor allem aus dem Umland, nicht nur in Paris) bewog die Nationalversammlung, einige wichtige Schritte durchzuführen: Die feudalen Vorrechte wurden abgeschafft (noch vor einem Jahr h?tte ich meinen Kopf über derlei Unm?gliches geschüttelt), die Kirchengüter wurden nationalisiert (eine Sache, die Maman gar nicht in den Kopf wollte), die Menschen- und Bürgerrechte wurden festgelegt (woraufhin Papa ein Festessen ansetzte) und die Abschaffung des Erbadels wurde durchgesetzt (was Adèle unter ihres Freundes radikalem Einflusse sofort zu befürworten wusste). Ach ja: Der K?nig hat sich noch unbeliebter gemacht, als er es ohnehin schon ist: Er stimmte gegen die meisten Beschlüsse der Nationalversammlung und wurde infolgedessen und in Hinblick auf die erneute Lebensmittelknappheit von einer Horde wilder Marktfrauen besucht, die seine Umsiedlung nach Paris erzwangen... Diesmal waren es die Damen in der Familie, die zuerst gro?e Zustimmung ?u?erten! <br>  1791<br>  Juni<br>  Der K?nig hat versucht, zu entfliehen! Ganz Paris ist in h?chster Aufruhr. Man hat ihn in Varennes fassen k?nnen, als er gerade in einer Gastwirtschaft inkognito hatte einkehren wollen! Sogleich wurde er mit gro?em Tamtam wieder nach Paris eingeführt - wir standen am Stra?enrande und schauten sp?ttisch dem langen Zuge aus feixenden Revolution?ren an, die in ihrer Mitte die k?nigliche Familie (welche freilich eine bitterb?se bis ?ngstlich-entwürdigte Miene aufsetzten) transportierten. Nun steht seine Exzellenz der K?nig von Frankreich zur Belustigung der Massen unter Hausarrest in den Tuillerien. Er ist da nicht der erste, der entfleuchen wollte - verschiedene Vertreter des ersten Standes sind seit den Sommerereignissen 1789 ins Ausland entflohen. Man sagt, sie würden dort eine Streitmacht gegen unsere Revolution?re zusammentrommeln. Wie dem auch sei - das franz?sische Volk ist jetzt so m?chtig, dass nichts Ernstes befürchtet werden muss. <br>  <br>  3. September<br>  Endlich ist es soweit! Die neue Verfassung steht, dem K?nig hat man auch noch ein bisschen Macht geschenkt (Adèle meint aus Mitleid) und unsereins hat endlich konkrete Mitbestimmungsrechte in Form von Wahlrechten erhalten. Papa und Adèles Freund haben sich heftig gestritten über die neuen Grundlagen - Pierre hielt das Wahlrecht, was nur für die Verm?genden gilt, für ungerecht. Papa hingegen hebt die guten Seiten der Verfassung hervor: Exekutive, Legislative und Justiz werden streng voneinander getrennt w?hrend die Nationalversammlung das politische Gewicht innehat. Ich muss Pierre recht geben: Die Forderung nach Gleichheit aller Menschen findet hier noch keine Erfüllung.<br>  Der K?nig hat sich beeilt, der Verfassung seine Treue zu schw?ren - in seiner Situation w?re anderes Handeln unklug<br>  1792<br>  25. April<br>  Schon wieder Krieg? Ein seltsames Gefühl. Unsere Nation ist erst im Aufbau und schon wird wieder ein Krieg begonnen. Die Girondisten, ursprünglich ein politischer Debatierclub, hat nun das meiste politische Gewicht in der Nationalversammlung. Es wird gemunkelt, dass mit einem Kriege von den inneren Schwierigkeiten abgelenkt werden soll und dass der Krieg eine weitere Einigungskraft darstelle. Auch der K?nig befürwortet den Krieg - naturgem?? haben das viele der politischen Lager sehr kritisch aufgefasst. Papa meint, der K?nig treibe ein Doppelspiel - er befürworte den Krieg in echt nur deshalb, weil die neue Nation damit geschw?cht und die Altvorderen wieder an Macht gewinnen k?nnten. Viele denken ?hnlich - die Ressentiments gegen den K?nig mehren sich... <br>  <br>  10. August<br>  Der K?nig ist so gut wie entmachtet! Wieder einmal hat das Volk Entscheidendes geleistet. Nach den verschiedenen Nachrichten, dass der K?nig der Nation durch sein verr?terisches Doppelspiel schade, erstürmte man die Tuilerien, woraufhin sich der K?nig in den Schutz der gesetzgebenden Versammlung begab. Dort wurde er freilich sofort seines Amtes enthoben... <br>  <br>  Sommer<br>  Es gibt gro?en Streit in der Familie. Papa, der sich nun deutlich zu den Girondisten bekennt, hat Adèles Freund Pierre des Hauses verwiesen. Der n?mlich ist mittlerweile Montagne-Anh?nger. Auch mich m?chte er überzeugen, der "Bergpartei" beizutreten (mit der Bergpartei ist die radikale Linke gemeint, die in der Versammlung auf den hohen R?ngen sitzt) aber ich fühle mich noch nicht bereit, eine klare Entscheidung zu treffen. Als ich ihm das in Papas Anwesenheit klar machte, verspottete er mich nur und bezeichnete mich als "Marais" (in der Nationalversammlung gibt es n?mlich Unentschlossenen, die von allen ver?chtlich "Marais", Sumpf genannt werden. Papa pl?diert für eine Einigung mit dem K?nig w?hrend Pierre eine Republik ohne jegliche Form von Monarchie verlangt. Wenn es ganz nach ihm ginge, sollte der K?nig sogar umgebracht werden. Adèle hat es schwer - sie steht zwischen den beiden wütenden M?nnern und versucht Frieden zu stiften - vergebens. Maman und sie halten nun sehr zusammen und schimpfen auf die beiden Wüteriche. Ich halte mich da lieber heraus. Heute Morgen ist es zu der schlimmsten Konfrontation zwischen den beiden gekommen, als n?mlich Pierre um Adèles Hand anhielt und Papa fragte. Dieser lehnte Pierres Wunsch kühl ab und bat den jungen Mann, nie wieder bei uns aufzutauchen. Die beiden schrieen sich an, Papa bekam wieder Nasenbluten und nahm alle seine Kr?fte zusammen, um Pierre achtkantig aus der Wohnung zu werfen. Wir h?rten ihn nur noch die Treppe herunterpoltern. Adèle tut mir leid - sie ist zu empfindsam für solche Szenen. Vorwürfe hat sie Papa noch keine gemacht.<br>  Immer deutlicher scheint sich jedoch ein Sieg für die radikale Linke abzuzeichnen - man sprach heute in der Boulangerie von den vielen Unentschlossenen, die sich wegen der Haltung der Girondisten zum Verbleib des K?nigs zu den Linken geschlagen h?tten. Die Bergpartei und die Sansculotten (so nennt man jene, die die breiten, armen Massen in Paris vertreten) gew?nnen an Macht. <br>  <br>  24. September<br>  Nun gibt es schon seit mehreren Jahren Unruhen - immer wieder durchzucken neue Meldungen die Stadt. Die neue Nationalversammlung, in der die Linke immer mehr an Macht gewinnt, nennt sich jetzt Nationalkonvent. Vor ein paar Tagen wurde die Republik ausgerufen - damit ist das K?nigtum in Frankreich endgültig entmachtet. Nie h?tte ich damals, als ich von meiner Begeisterung für die Werte Gleichheit und Freiheit schrieb, einen solchen Umsturz der Verh?ltnisse für m?glich gehalten. Denke ich an meine frühe Jugend zurück, so kann ich kaum fassen, wie viel sich für uns innerhalb so kurzer Zeit ge?ndert hat. Die Ideen eines freien, gleichberechtigten Menschen hat freilich schon vorher kursiert (als ich zw?lf Jahre alt war, sprach Papa bereits davon) doch die Umkrempelung buchst?blich aller alten Verh?ltnisse mutet schon sonderbar an. Unsere Nation ist im Entstehen - doch fertig sind wir noch lange nicht. Traurige Meldungen treffen fast t?glich ein - eine der denkwürdigsten ist sicher die Information über die 1100 Gefangenen, die in diesem Herbst aus Rachegründen vom Staat get?tet wurden. Man hatte sie der Kollaboration mit Konterrevolution?ren beschuldigt und im Zuge des beginnenden Krieges t?ten lassen. Wie ist das mit den Menschenrechten zu vereinbaren, deren Einführung doch so viel Anklang unter uns allen fand?<br>  Nein, Pierre, ich kann nicht der Bergpartei beitreten. Ich kann es nicht, auch wenn die Forderungen nach einem Wahlrecht für alle wichtig sind. Ich kann es nicht, weil ich eine gewisse Entfremdung spüre zwischen dem Fortgang der Revolution und mir. Das wofür ich mit zur Bastille ging, die Menschenrechte, der Kampf gegen den Despotismus - alle diese Punkte sind dem allgemeinen Machtkampfe und Machtstreben der Parteien gewichen. Auch Papa schwingt keine leidenschaftlichen Reden mehr - ich glaube, dass meine ganze Familie einen Ernüchterungsprozess unterl?uft. Und Pierre? Der redet sich vielleicht in irgendeinem politischen Club seinen Hass von der Seele.<br>  Sommer 1794<br>  Vor ein einhalb Jahren schrieb ich zuletzt in dieses Buch. Ich stellte damals eine gewisse Wandlung an mir selbst fest, eine Entzweiung mit dem Fortlauf der Revolution. Vieles ist seither geschehen, Ereignisse, von denen ich bisher nicht schreiben konnte. Nun m?chte ich versuchen, das, was geschehen ist, in Worte zu fassen. <br>  <br>   Zun?chst einmal muss ich vom Ende des K?nigs sagen - im letzten Winter beschloss man, ihn hinzurichten. Sein Haupt fiel unter dem Schafott. Langsam aber stetig arbeiteten die Jakobiner an ihrer Machtergreifung - erst unterschwellig und dann unverblümt ?ffentlich. Mit der Gründung des Wohlfahrtsausschusses am 6. April begann ein neuer Abschnitt in der franz?sischen Revolution. Als Verteidigungsausschuss geplant, übernahmen auch dort bald die Jakobiner, unter der Leitung von Monsieur Robespierre die Macht. Ende Mai 1793 organisierten die Sanscoulotten einen Aufstand gegen den Konvent und begannen, die Girondisten systematisch zu verdr?ngen.<br>  Am 2. Juni 1793 umstellten Nationalgardisten den Versammlungsort und nahmen 29 Abgeordnete und zwei Minister der Girondisten unter Arrest. Bald schon folgten weitere Verhaftungen, Kurzprozesse und Hinrichtungen. Auf den Pariser Stra?en, wo doch sonst so ?ffentlich diskutiert wurde, gingen die Leute nun schweigend ihre Wege. Nur die Jakobiner blühten noch mehr auf - ihre Siegesgewissheit kannte keine Grenzen. Ein Revolutionstribunal wurde errichtet, in dem Gegner der Revolution kurzerhand zum Tode verurteilt wurden. Die Begriffe Gleichheit, Freiheit und Brüderlichkeit waren verschwunden. Nur noch ihre Worthüllen bl?hten sich auf in der Sprache der fanatischen Jakobiner. <br>  <br>  Drei Monate ist es her. Jemand muss energisch an unsere Tür geklopft haben. Sehr früh morgens, nur Maman und Papa müssen schon wach gewesen sein. Maman hat, wie sie uns sp?ter erz?hlte, die Türe ge?ffnet. Drei M?nner h?tten sie barsch in die Wohnung gedr?ngt, w?ren an ihr vorbei ins Schlafzimmer gestürmt, wo Papa sich gerade umzog. An den Armen h?tten sie ihn herausgezerrt. Als Adèle und ich bleich und verschreckt durch den L?rm auf den Flur traten, lag Vater auf dem Boden. Pierre blickte uns mit einem schrecklichen Grinsen an und sagte nur folgendes: "Euer Vater ist wegen konterrevolution?rer Gesinnung unter Arrest gestellt! Lebe wohl, Adèle." Er machte auf dem Absatz kehrt, die beiden anderen Burschen schleiften Vater davon, der sich vergeblich zu wehren versuchte.<br>  Mit einem schleifenden Ger?usch und einem dumpfen Knall am Ende fiel die Tür hinter ihnen zu. Diese Ger?usche werden nicht aus meinem Kopfe gehen. Sie sagten uns, dass man ihn zum Tod durchs Schafott verurteilt h?tte. Das Schleifen der Tür und das dumpfe Einrasten des Schlosses produzieren fast t?glich Bilder in meinem Kopf - Bilder vom Schafott, das schleifend herunterrast und mit einem dumpfen Prall Vater t?tet. Auch in der Nacht tr?ume ich diese Ger?usche und die damit assoziierten Bilder. Dann wache ich schwei?überstr?mt auf und lausche den Ger?uschen der Nacht. Ich hasse die Ger?usche der Revolution - das Fu?getrappel, die Schüsse, das Knirschen der Zugbrücke der Bastille, die Tür, das Schafott. Sie sind das Requiem eines Traumes von uneingeschr?nkter Freiheit, Gleichheit und Brüderlichkeit|`|1c07cdd8d513a5c6670e8a3049a4a31baa	wie mein prof immer sagt: man muss eigentlich nichts wissen, au?er wo es steht. und in dem falle würd ich auf tausende von geschichtsbüchern tippen. <br>  und wenn ich nett w?re k?nnt ich dir auch mein 13 punkte referat über die franz rev schicken. so nett bin ich aber nicht :D|`|2fc270d5a4f75b58417589f41d373419aa	Wenn Du Dir etwas zur franz?sischen Revolution vorlesen lassen m?chtest, dann kannst Du das auf der Seite der Zeitschrift GEo tun.

j5Apt8hWaa	"orangey" pictures are caused by having the white balance set for daylight or flash, but you are using  and incandescent light source  There is a nearly 2000 degree Kelvin difference in the light temperature.    Using high ISO settings will increase the noise produced by the amplification of the signal sent from the sensor.    Subjects being "washed out" has to do with overexposure.    Flash can only light a very thin area in front of the camera, subjects closer will be washed out and those further away will be too dark.    You may want to take a basic class in photography to understand the physics, mechanical and other technical aspects of controlling exposure, even if your P&S camera promises to figure out the exposure for you, there are certain limitations.

3LQVJ7PYaa	Dude's out of luck as far as knowing for sure, obviously.    Depending on the country and its laws, which may be too much of a hassle to find out just for a story, marriage in itself may make the dude responsible for whatever offspring was produced.    I think I read a historical romance once where a crescent-shaped birthmark was used for this. I guess you'd have to go with something dumb like that. It's not like a mail-in DNA kit is getting invented any time in their near future. :-)|`|pI5jKfmaaa	A marriage is a socially, sometimes religiously, and often legally recognized union between or among partners forming a family, legitimizing sexual relations between the partners and providing the context for legitimate production of offspring. Marriages are generally publicly declared in the context of a wedding ceremony.     Marriage as an institution traces back into antiquity and is found in nearly every culture. Usually it is understood to join a man and woman (who in their marital roles are termed the "husband" and "wife" respectively; generically they may be referred to as "spouses") in a monogamous marriage. Polygamous marriage, in which one person takes more than one spouse, is ancient, but is now common only in Africa and Asia; polygyny (a man with multiple wives) is the typical form of polygamy, while polyandry (in which a woman takes several husbands) is rare    The way in which a marriage is enacted has changed over time, as has the institution of marriage itself. In Europe during the Middle Ages, marriage was enacted by the couple promising verbally to each other that they would be married to each other; the presence of a priest or other witnesses was not required. This promise was known as the "verbum". If made in the present tense (e.g. "I marry you"), it was unquestionably binding; if made in the future tense ("I will marry you"), it would, by itself constitute a betrothal, but if the couple proceeded to have sexual relations, the union was a marriage. As part of the Reformation, the role of recording marriages and setting the rules for marriage passed to the state; by the 1600s many of the Protestant European countries had heavy state involvement in marriage. As part of the Counter-Reformation, the Catholic Church added a requirement of witnesses to the promise, which under normal circumstances had to include the priest.|`|mnIeK8q6aa	It depends on his relation with his wife and child, if he had any other children which were indubitably his, his social position and most important of all: whether it's common knowledge or not.     If he had a good loving relationship with his wife and child, no other children and nobody knew about it: hush hush never mind.    If not: though luck, all the money goes to the family, church or the poor house. The child could consider itself lucky if not thrown on the street.     A child born out of wedlock was - and technically still is - known as a bastard. Something you'd rather not want to be until after WW2.

Have you considered applying for college or conservatory where you can participate in opera workshop and other performing opportunities?  You'll be able to study foreign languages (important for classical singers), improve your musicianship, and learn vocal pedagogy.  Performing and having support from people active in the musical community will go a long way.  And there are a number of opera and musical theater workshops during summers.  Always do your best to be a good team player and work with your directors.

jnxLprxRaa	Why don't you read books and see how great writers write, read the classics, and take a creative writing class at community college.    Eight rules for writing fiction:    Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.   Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.   Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.   Every sentence must do one of two things  reveal character or advance the action.   Start as close to the end as possible.   Be a sadist. Now matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them  in order that the reader may see what they are made of.   Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.   Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.

sWA7xAtuaa	Language keeps on evolving with time. Its sometimes hard for us to understand what is being said in a piece of literature due to this age linked obscenity. So abridged(easily understandable) versions of such literary materials are created for us to understand. I would suggest you an abridged version no matter if its an audiobeek or simply a book.    Sooner you might be reading unabridged versions provided your interest and knowledge about literature grew with time. :)|`|MmbLWe3Qaa	I'd prefer unabridged.|`|Ci3Efibkaa	abridged is a shortened version    i appreciate the whole thing|`|1asStWo4aa	My preference would depend on when the book was written, more than anything.

Especially if it would help me understand it better. . .
k3LbhASGaa	I had to get the dictionary for this one, having only a Ged, I am not smart as you are in the way you think, but here is my opinion. Morality is not learned , we are born with it , some more than others, let me explain. When you see some one getting hurt , you can say one of  two things , one, glad it is not me , or two ,that is wrong stop it . Usually killers do not see the error of their ways in till it is their turn to die, just like thieves, they think it is ok to steal in till they are stolen from and then they get offended and forget what they are . So if right and wrong is relative , then it is ok to throw this boiling pot of water on you because I think it is ok even though you may not. and if any one objects what gives them that authority ? them selves or someone else?. Oh and about the Abrahamic God, do your reaserch , those people where cruel baby killers, cannibals and just down right evil in my book so I think they probably had it comming for a long time|`|MBhKmsjCaa	yeah, most morals are relative - if its always wrong to steal then it must be wrong to steal food for your starving family.  i disagree with that.  but i also believe that there are some things, such as your torturing babies idea,  which is just plain wrong and there are no crcumstances in which tht is okay.  so i guess that sometimes, it swings either way.|`|FoIxsunVaa	I have a conscience, God or no God, which is black and white absolutist and (for me) objective.

Morality in this world would be certain values that are necessary to ensure greater well being of us all collectively.... in other words, restraints on those individual freedom, whims and fancies that can harm others. Such morality can obviously be only objective.|`|lL6oGDU8aa	All morals come from God.    Just kidding.    I think the common human experience gives a better foundation for objective morality than some deity. First of all, if the existence of said deity is far from certain, how can morality that comes from it be objective? Also, I find the Euthrypho Dilemma convincing. Either morality exists independent of God, or God made up morality arbitrarily. Some people respond by saying that God is Goodness itself, and is incapable of commanding anything but what is moral. But what does that say about the Abrahamic god commanding all the Old Testament massacres?    To my mind, what makes morality objective is that we all take part in the experience of being human... pain, joy, achieving goals and failing to achieve them, etc. Being quasi-rational as we are, we can't help but to extrapolate that others experience these things as we do, and the result is some degree of empathy and compassion. Of course, people can ignore this implus (just like people can ignore God and go to Hell voluntarily). But what makes that moral impulse objective is that everybody has it simply because they are human.|`|F5v5Qme0aa	Morality is man made - just another way of creating guilt.  There may appear to be certain principals that should be universal, but upon closer inspection, I really don't think that it is our place to say.  Who am I to dictate what is right for anyone but me?     Also, the term "a Godless world ", is like saying "an Ocean without water".  Our collective consciousness IS God.  The power that created us does not judge us - we do that to ourselves and to each other.     It is only here, in this material realm that ideas like right & wrong exist.  Beyond this plane... they have no meaning.

4n2b3wNzaa	hi  Take no notice of the people who make fun. I think your ideas have potential. However, if your aim is to write a sonnet then you need to follow the tradition of sonnet writing which includes using 7 lines and a fixed number of syllables for each line so that it flows. In the final line, there is usually a moral or a conclusion or a question to get the reader to think. Please check this because I do remember that the sonnet is very compact in structure. Take for example Shakespeare's famous one called 'shall I compare thee to a summer's day?'. Google it, read it, count the lines and check the flow. You will see what I mean.    Once you get the idea, shorten your poem and capture the sonnet style. You can do this by keeping your 'important' sentences, rearranging the number of syllables for each line and fitting them together to form the sonnet.      Youve made a good start because you have the theme and the content ready so it won't take long.    Good luck!|`|2bF20YrBaa	i find your sonnet creative. you vividly describe how the panda feels after the tourist visiting hours. it's okay to explore beyond the traditional Shakespearean or Petrarch sonnet, it doesn't really need that you follow the iambic pentameter, ABABCDCDEFEFGG pattern unless it's a requirement in your school.|`|ZS5FI34waa	this is ******* pathetic|`|xc7X1WlHaa	Bad, very bad.

Sh3vYDr3aa	A controversy exists in regards to whether or not any parts of the historic region of Macedonia are incorporated in the present-day the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as very little if any of the ancient Macedonian kingdom is. There is also controversy, however, with regards to the Slavic peoples who are concentrated in less than half of the region. They first arrived in the late 6th and early 7th centuries AD when Slavic-speaking populations overturned Macedonia's Greek ethnic composition. As a result, the appropriation by the "Republic of Macedonia" of what Greece held as its "Greek symbols", raised concerns in Greece as well as fuelling nationalist anger. This anger was reinforced by the legacy of the Civil War and the view in some quarters, that members of Greece's Slavic-speaking minority were pro-Yugoslavian and presented a danger to its borders. The status of the Republic of Macedonia became a heated political issue in Greece where demonstrations took place in Athens while one million Macedonian Greeks took to the streets in Thessaloniki in 1992, under the slogan: "Macedonia is Greek", referring to the name and ancient history of the region, not posing a territorial claim against their northern neighbor. Initially, the Greek government objected formally to any use of the name Macedonia (including any derivative names) and also to the use of symbols such as the Vergina Sun. On the other hand, also in 1992, demonstrations by more than 100,000 ethnic Slav Macedonians took place in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia, over the failure to receive recognition and supporting the constitutional name of the country.    The FYROM printed currency with landmarks currently located within Greek Borders and they were forced to destroy that money and change their flag... but they continue to lay claim to the ancient lands of Macedonia when they are only in possesion of 30% and the other land is in Serbia, Albania, Bulgaria and the majority in Greece. The part cannot claim the whole. How can you be a descendant of Alexander when your people did not come into the region until 9 centuries later?    Historical Macedonia is considered to be the realm of Philip II, father of Alexander the Great (4th century BC), 90 percent of which is now the Greek region of Macedonia and the remaining 10 percent in southwestern FYROM around Monastir, Bitola and toward the Ohrid lakes.     So how can anyone say the FYROM was the western half? More like the Northwestern 10%...lol     Was Phillip Greek?  There is no question that he was. The ancient Macedonians spoke Greek. Exhaustive research shows that linguistically and culturally, the ancient Macedonians were Greek tribes. All inscriptions found in Macedonia dating from before the advent of the Romans are Greek, as are the names of peoples and their gods. The names Philip and Alexander derive from Greek words. That much is clear and anything else is the result of propaganda by Skopje. Alexander Himself proclaimed that he was a descendant of Greeks from Argos. So if the FYROMians claim to be descendants of Alexander than they are Also Greek by default since Alexander considered himself a Greek.    In the 6th and 7th centuries AD, they moved into the whole of the southern Balkans and created a strong population base in the area in question, where the populations had dwindled due to wars and invasions. Despite their efforts, however, they were unable to seize Thessaloniki, the joint capital, in a manner of speaking, of the Byzantine empire.      Greeks are not promoting hate but ever since ancient times we unite to defend against an aggressor (I don't want to say enemy because I don't believe that Greece sees the FYROM as an enemy but rather a misguided neighbor) and I don't see anything wrong with fighting false propaganda. The only reason the FYROM got so far is because of US backing because of Us interests. In fact the US Congress disagrees with the President's decisions to recognise the FYROM with their constitutional name.  US House of Representatives in 1361 resolution on Durban Revision Conference, unanimously adopted by the Plenum, refers to our neigbouring country as FYROM and not as "Republic of Macedonia. It is a first time that a unanimous decision of the US House of Representatives makes clear reference of the neighbouring countrys internationally recognized name. It should be reminded that the two bodies of US Congress-House of Representatives 356 resolution and the Senates 300 resolution  call FYROM to put a halt to its hostile and irredentist campaign against Greece and work constructively to produce a mutually acceptable solution to name issue.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	I guess because he conquered the known world so maybe saying he was just from Macedonia would be an understatement.|`|AA10729675	Alexander the Macedonian, was from Macedonia, king of Macedonia. However, at the time, Alexander started to wear Persian robes, and the Macedonians were shocked.  They did not call him "the Great".  Romans did, long after Alexander's time.  As for Macedonia today, there is a lot of controversy.  It used to be Greek, part of Greece.  It had been conquered by other people, and now, some say that it is Slavonic, which is totally untrue.  You are right:  Macedonians should be very, very proud of even living on the soil Alexander walked upon.  It seems that when politics and religion start to mix, there are a lot of troubles.|`|S1uPEgbTaa	Ancient Macedonia was part from Ancient Greece.  There are artifacts that proove this.Tons of them.

mnIeK8q6aa	The Roman empire was from very early linguistically divided: the western half spoke latin, the eastern half spoke greek. greek was the lingua franca of that part of the world long before the Romans conquered it, and remained the common language after the fall of the western half of the empire.     Of course in the early days of the Eastern empire latin was spoken pretty widely, but after the fall of the Western empire, less and less.    In those days Turkey didn't exist, it was known as Asia Minor. The common language (there were many local languages) was Greek.|`|d5005b7e54b8bec0697ec47a83b82fb8aa	The primary language used in the eastern Roman provinces (i.e. the Eastern Roman Empire) even before the decline of the Western Empire had always been Greek.[128] Indeed early on in the life of the Roman Empire Greek had become the common language in the Christian Church, the language of scholarship and the arts, and, to a large degree, the lingua franca for trade between provinces and with other nations.[129] The language itself for a time gained a dual nature with the primary spoken language, Koine, existing alongside an older literary language with Koine eventually evolving into the standard dialect.[130]|`|heF3HIzQaa	Of course many did speak Latin, but yes, Greek was the language because Byzantium was essentially a Greek City State, part of the Greek sphere of influence.    Most of the inhabitants spoke Greek, so it made sense.    Greek was widely spoken by the educated elite in Rome as well as Latin. Greek and Latin were the only 'non-barbarian' languages (according to the Romans).

This extreme view that  over-values material things is a misconception, the result of  unreasonable, illogical thought.     Therefore, if you want true peace, happiness and joy, you need to  realize that happiness and satisfaction come from within you and stop  searching so fanatically outside.

(without the use of money)    These are people who just appear to be "lucky," but there is something else going on there. They are in the light, and this kind of pure light gives them the power to get what they want.    So on the surface, this kind of knowledge is seen by those on the outside as "good luck" or serendipity.    And this why many spiritual leaders recommend to "increase the light."

Certainly, money has been given the power to create things through the purchasing of materials. It has the ability to change the things around a person, the state of the world, a status in society, both good and bad. But make no mistake, knowledge, fundamentally, is power.  Without knowledge, we as a people are only instinctual animals, with no knowledge of bartering, trade, or money. We would eat, sleep, and survive with nothing more. Some live, most die. Knowledge gives meaning to money as a way of making the challenges of the world easier. But without knowledge, money has no meaning. If we don't know how to build a house, paper dollars do not have the power to give us shelter. If we don't know how to hunt, cultivate, mass produce, or feed ourselves, money does not have the ability to make us survive. If we become sick, money does not have the power of a doctor with knowledge to cure us.  Rather, how much you know can drastically change your life. Knowledge opens the keys to all doors; be it knowing that we want to make lots of money and have tons of capital or knowing that we want to live a simple life without money. If we don't have the knowledge of where we're headed, money can not save you. It can place you somewhere, change the scenery around you, but it does not have the power to do anything more than what we want it to.    If you're hungry one day and you see a fisherman, you could buy a fish off him and eat for the day. If you're hungry one day and you ask a fisherman to teach you how to catch fish, you eat for a lifetime, regardless of how much money you have. In that sense, knowledge is power.|`|vuKD7je1aa	Well, knowledge empowers one to be able to be successful and make money.  Yes, it is sad how much money rules our day to day lives.

DIlNnjf8aa	The point of studying history is to apply its lessons to the present.    The corruptions of Boss Tweed couldn't even get close to the corruptions of politics in the US today. Perhaps DC should be renamed Tweedtown in his honor.    Were he alive now, he'd be admiring the Bush fraud and intimidation that characterized the presidential election of 2000.     He'd love Cheney's masterful lies that made huge profits for oil and other corporations at the cost of lives in Iraq and elsewhere. The slick campaign of associating Iraq with 9/11 and with possession of nukes would make him salivate.    So far as I know, Tweed's corruptions didn't kill anyone. But I'm pretty sure he'd have nothing but glowing admiration for a system so corrupt that sending Americans to their deaths in Iraq for big oil is portrayed as patriotism.    Tweed put NYC $97 million in debt over a career spanning decades; contrast that with the $700 billion of our money that Congress recently donated  in just one vote to the banks.     Tweed stalled progress in NYC by opposing a subway system that would have competed with his ownership of surface transport. That piece of work pales in comparison with the rejection of the Bering Strait railway link that would have kept America competitive in Asia and Europe. And just to show how effective it is, no one has even heard of the proposed Bering Strait link. Now, THAT'S corruption.    Now we've got a new president who is committed to change. He smiles at Muslims while he drops his bombs on families in Pakistan and Afghanistan.    We have long had the resources to produce CTL (Coal to Liquid) that turns coal into oil and keep the price of oil from going more than $50 per barrel (about $1.65 for a gallon of gasoline).

egRullZPaa	Develop a character checklist. I was teaching a group of high school kids to write a novel, during NaNoWriMo and they had a great character checklist. I'll copy it here, if you do this for each one of your characters you'll be off to a head start. You don't have to answer all the questions, but the more you answer, the more you'll learn about your character, and what makes them act the way they do.    Once you have your character down a bit, a really fun way to get to know them is to interview them, or just sit down and have a conversation with them. You type your part of the conversation, then type the answer 'they' give you. I have learned so much about my characters like this, including things they didn't agree with about my novel.      Here's a list to start with:  1. Name:  2. Age:  3. Height:  4. Eye color:  5. Physical appearance:  6. Strange or unique physical attributes:  7. Favorite clothing style/outfit:  8.

adZszNOuaa	Aw that sounds so cute! Have you showed him that?    That would be so adorable :)    You did great great great! You are an awesome poet and keep it up.     Yes I get writers block as well and I know, it's very annoying and makes me feel like a bad author, but when with inspiration the mind can do great things.     So I think instead of just imagining like you used to do, maybe you just need to find your inspirations for your individual poems.    Perhaps that's the way you write. :)    Or maybe even just write by what you are feeling, what makes you feel strongly about something, something big going on in the world, the problems and emotions that things bring to people.    Dare to write what comes from your heart, dare to write what no body else can.     Express your opinions and messages you want to send to people through riddles even.    It doesn't necessarily need to rhyme and make sense.  It can be alliteration, you can add personification, things like that.    He looks so peaceful - this sends a message to the readers that the writer is watching him, describing as someone sweet and soft by using the word peaceful.  With his head on his pillow - this determines that the 'peaceful' boy is not dead, but merely asleep.  While time just passes by - It shows how the writer is watching him in adoration, which tells the reader that there is a possible close relationship with him.  Far away he's dreaming - It shows that he is in a deep sleep without knowing that eyes on on him.  As I watch him sleeping - Confirms the writer is watching him.  In my bed he lyes - Confirms the fact that a relationship is hsared between the two, the type of relationship however is not specified.  I start to wonder - this line simply leads to the next.  Why he's right here with me - This is saying that he must be adored very greatly by this admiring writer.  Out of everyone else - a line that continues to the next.  He could do better - Confirms that the relationship the two share is love.  Lord, He could do better - A cleverly repeated line.  The rest of the poem is a description on how much the writer loves and cares for this boy.    You have used a very well balanced out and sweet lay out, and chosen your words lovingly and emotionally.    Anyway keep up the awesome work, you are brilliant and I am sure that some of your poems could become Famous if you decide to keep writing beautiful poems like this. ^_^    Wonderful work - I love it |`|4Al9aapdaa	Don't over think... Go with the flow... write down the the first things that come to mind when you think of the topic you want to write about, it may be words or phrases... then piece them together or they may further inspire you , just don't force creativity upon yourself it will come on its own , no matter how frustrating it is avoid persevering.  we've all been there :) Different things work for different people...

Take care.  Mani|`|t7O3Erpvaa	Firstly english isn't your first language is it? I recommend you take some remedial english classes at your local adult learning centre.    I notice that you have attempted some rhyming tenets throughout the piece, however your in consistence makes it feel halting, jerky.    The two line where you repeat yourself, "He could do better:,"Lord, he could do better", are either brilliant or self-indulgence and unimaginative; I'm not sure which.     Which brings me to my point: Poetry is about self expression. Think of the things that happened to you today. When you feel an emotion strongly, remember it. Keep a small notepad with you wherever you go, so if you see hear or feel something noteworthy, you can write it down immediately so you don't forget it. This book of ideas will help you in those moments when you sit down to write poetry and draw a blank.    If all else fails, try a haiku. They are quick, easy and will boost your confidence for your next poetic undertaking:    Stimulus, you lack.  Small note-book, I recommend.  Or maybe Haikus      Hope that helps you.|`|ubM4Wz9yaa	basicly dont force it write when u get inspired and basicly put pen to paper and let it flow it doesnt have to be perfect just write what ur feeling|`|KUZrSrrBaa	Is this about me? ;)
XvO4iLk0aa	G The most important insight about those issues are contained in the results of consictently using the LDK.  Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|ZtfO38N0aa	Politics is flawed  Economics is boring  Religion is confusing  Ethics/morality is essential to human development  Meaning in life is pointless  Poverty is unavoidable in human civilisation  Truth is when seen beautiful  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder|`|0GNcOTIwaa	-Politics are an opinion, not the truth  -Economics are going to cause another Great Depression  -Religion is different with all people  -Ethics/Morality are what all people should follow  -Meaning in life is yet to answered...  -Poverty is never-ending no matter what you do about it  -Truth is what blinds people and suffocates lies  -Beauty is within if you are patient enough|`|ZUtLKMFMaa	-Politics is dirty.  -Economics is unpredictable.  -Religion is my salvation.  -Ethics / Morality is what makes us human.  -Meaning of life is to make it a better place.  -Poverty is the darkest places u can be.  -Truth is rarely found.  -Beauty is what makes life easier to live.

YEfW3vI0aa	Yeah I often notice this! Books are amazing and can really change your perspective on life! They can take you to a new world, share amazing experiences and either make you laugh or cry. I love reading, and I get a lot of enjoyment out of it.    Just ignore anyone that teases you, they just don't know the magic of reading!|`|crWA9ZD5aa	i haven't been in that kind of situation before, im in high school myself and i know heaps of people who enjoy a good book1 but i find it quite stupid y people would consider "reading" uncool. obviously they would rather get drunk than read a good book and they also lack culture!some people r too ignorant and do not appreciate the beauty of books. they say reading can improve and help u in spelling, comprehension, vocabulary, writing, mainly anything relating to english so i don't know y its considered uncool. those kind of people really piss me off because they don't look at themselves in the mirror and judge what they see in the reflection but prefer to judgewhatt other people do.don'tt worry about freaks like that, when they get older they'll be regretting that they never picked up a good book!|`|sZYbf0hcaa	What's really fun to do is take your Bible along to class and start reading it.

I'm sorry that your school-mates don't read, but you shouldn't mind them. Don't let anyone stop you from reading. You shouldn't feel sad because of them, they aren't important at all.

nxW1zZ9naa	the anti-white mania which has gripped modern Britain, the Atlantic Slave Trade is to be given wide prominence in schools from this term onwards-but the million Europeans who were enslaved by Muslims in North Africa between 1530 and 1780 will be ignored.    The untold story of the million whites enslaved by non-whites is covered in a book by Robert Davis, professor of history at Ohio State University. He developed a unique methodology to calculate the number of white Christians who were enslaved along Africas Barbary Coast, arriving at much higher slave population estimates than any previous studies had found.    Most previously estimated slave counts have thus tended to be in the thousands, or at most in the tens of thousands. Davis, by contrast, has calculated that between 1 million and 1.25 million European Christians were captured and forced to work in North Africa from the 16th to 18th centuries.    Daviss new estimates appear in the book Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500-1800 (Palgrave Macmillan).    Enslavement was a very real possibility for anyone who travelled in the Mediterranean, or who lived along the shores in places like Italy, France, Spain and Portugal, and even as far north as England and Iceland.    From 1500 to 1650, when trans-Atlantic slaving was still in its infancy, more white Christian slaves were probably taken to Barbary than black African slaves to the Americas, according to Davis.    One of the things that both the public and many scholars have tended to take as given is that slavery was always racial in nature-that only blacks have been slaves. But that is not true, Davis said. We cannot think of slavery as something that only white people did to black people.    Pirates (called corsairs) from cities along the Barbary Coast in north Africa-cities such as Tunis and Algiers-would raid ships in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, as well as seaside villages to capture men, women and children.    The impact of these attacks was devastating- France, England, and Spain each lost thousands of ships, and long stretches of the Spanish and Italian coasts were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants.    Although hundreds of thousands of Christian slaves were taken from Mediterranean countries, Davis noted, the effects of Muslim slave raids was felt much further away: it appears, for example, that through most of the 17th century the English lost at least 400 sailors a year to the slavers.    Even Americans were not immune. For example, one American slave reported that 130 other American seamen had been enslaved by the Algerians in the Mediterranean and Atlantic between 1785 and 1793.    Using the same methodology, Davis has estimated as many as 475,000 additional slaves were taken in the previous and following centuries. The result is that between 1530 and 1780 there were almost certainly 1 million and quite possibly as many as 1.25 million white, European Christians enslaved by the Muslims of the Barbary Coast.    Davis said his research into the treatment of these slaves suggests that, for most of them, their lives were every bit as difficult as that of slaves in America. As far as daily living conditions, the Mediterranean slaves certainly didnt have it better, he said.    While African slaves did grueling labor on sugar and cotton plantations in the Americas, European Christian slaves were often worked just as hard and as lethally-in quarries, heavy construction, and above all rowing the corsair galleys themselves.    Davis said his findings suggest that this invisible slavery of European Christians deserves more attention from scholars.    We have lost the sense of how large enslavement could loom for those who lived around the Mediterranean and the threat they were under, he said. Slaves were still slaves, whether they were black or white, and whether they suffered in America or North Africa.

I do 50 crunches with my feet on the ground, knees bent, then 50 crunches legs in tabletop position, then 50 crunches legs in the air, pilates v, then 50 crunches legs in side split, then 50 legs in butterfly. Then I do 50 side crunches on each side, making a grand total of 350. Then I do leg dips to work my lower abdominals. Plank also helps. Do 2 minutes if you do it in regular push up position, or do 1 and 1/2 minutes if you do a forearm plank since its harder to start. Also, pilates pushups will work your scapular muscles to help you pull those shoulders back to prevent rounded shoulders. Don't worry about a number with these just yet, try to do as many as possible correctly and work upwards from there.   These are just to start with, talk to your ballet teacher about specific exercises to help with your tipped pelvis, or even your doctor. Good luck!|`|l51gE33Vaa	If you use your stomach muscles, (I don't think that 350 sit-ups is necessary, but at least do some) and your "rotaters" - my teacher calls them that because they make your legs turn out or rotate. "Rotaters" are at the bottom of your bottom (or top of the back of the leg, whichever). Flex them, i you can't feel them, do some clams.     CLAMS - Lie on your side with your legs at a ninety degree angle with your feet in line with your pelvis. Keeping your feet together lift up your knee as far as you can go with out moving any other part of your body.     After you have done as many as you can on both sides, do some more, but this time, when the knee is in the air, extend your leg so it is straight then place your feet back together and lower your knee. Always do it on both sides.     Hope this helps.   xxx

ql7fDxI5aa	Very good question and explanation.    You have to understand that people who are raised in a society that believes in destroying difference and not embracing individualism leads to a dysfunctional civilization. I firmly believe that a person's dreams and beliefs affect who they are, and are part of their composition as an individual. Take Russia, for example. I have many, many Russian friends that are immigrants into the U.S. Russia went through a period, as it was explained to me, where the government was attempting to unify the people and muster support. One method was to promote Atheism. They believed that if people did not believe in a God, that they would look towards their government as the "god"... and it worked fairly well. I bring this example up because my friends, being raised in a society where they were taught that all types of religion are "stupid", had trouble assimilating into the U.S. culture because of all of our differences in belief and acceptance of others who were, politically speaking, against what we believe in.   And as in ALL societies, there would be a revolution to overthrow the fascist domination of people's minds and behaviors. It may take a very long time, but it would be inevitable.  As an Arab American, I see the importance of accepting that other's have different beliefs and cultures. Not only is there importance in accepting, but even greater importance in understanding. This is a concept that the world has been struggling with since the beginning, and, in my opinion, will always struggle with.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Hitler would have decimated the population of the world.

Look at the now defunct U.S.S.R.  They were in existence far longer than Hitler.  The rulers of the U.S.S.R. basically had the same goal as Hitler.  The over taking of the entire world.   And the leaders of all major communist countries committed genocide just as Hitler did, albeit not in the numbers that Hitler attained.  But did the U.S.S.R. win out?      Did it happen?  No.  Where is the U.S.S.R. now?  Gone.      In the end I believe that all countries ruled like Hitler wanted to rule and the way the heirs of Stalin ruled finally have enough and the insanity is stamped out.    EDITED:  "Hitler was a very good Policitian (sic) and Germany was in deep recession when he came to power."    Hitler rose to power during the 1930's.  The 1930's for the entire world was one Great Depression.  Read your history.  Hitler used Jews and Communists as scape goats for the "problems" of Germany.  "They" caused the depression.  Not a world wide problem caused by not any particular group.  No Hitler came to power in France.  None in Canada.  None in the USA.  All in the gripe of the same "Great Depression."

America is a better place for me because my ancestor's compatriots killed the native Americans.  History is written by the winners, and if Hitler had won, people would probably think his regime was wonderful because they wouldn't know any better, or because thinking otherwise would get them killed.  All the people who thought fascism sucked would be dead and not contributing to the discussion.  Even taking all that into account, who's to say the world wouldn't be a better place if humanity killed itself off with large-scale biological warfare, leaving the Earth to recover from our environmental damage?  The world would be a better place for most other species if that happened.  What if sentient robots took our place and made humans obsolete?  The world might be a better place for robots, and they might run things here far more effectively than we ever had.  I don't think there really is an objective answer to this sort of question, but it is certainly thought-provoking.|`|d97e0d7c192c0cd5634d474777b47535aa	Odd question but a very good one.     I think the general idea of everyone working for the better good of all humanity is good but he twisted it and wanted to re-create the arian race and have them rule over the masses.     I don't believe the world would be better if he had won, mostly because there will always be people that resist. Different underground organizations would have formed and created factions to fight back and also fight each other for control over areas. Even if some one good united the world, that would still exist.

His beliefs and desires changed very quickly and very violently.  He was a massive hypocrite even in his own beliefs.  I understand the point that you are trying to make, but my point is that his philosophies were whimsical.  So one day year he might want to exterminate the Jews and another year it may be redheads.  He was also very wishy-washy about his religious beliefs.  Sometimes he would claim to accept a Christian god and other times he would denounce the idea of religion.    So the answer is no.  The world would be entirely unstable. (Much more than it is right now)|`|4esOOErCaa	yeah i know what you mean.. but what you are describing sort of sounds like communism (everyone living as one, same religion etc)    and well.. we all know that communism in theory sounds great    when put into action.. not so great. because it is human nature to want to be different from your neighbour. i know this sounds simplistic but, how boring would it be if everyone was the same?      however.. i do think that the world is a better place because of WWII (i know that the deaths and everything was terrible) especially on the social front. womens rights for example. sexual rights.. consumer rights.. heaps of stuff|`|w2qV8WEmaa	Would the world be a better place if the ancient Greeks rule the world ?  Would the world be a better place if the Romans rule the world ?  Would the world be a better place if the Mongolians rule the world ?  Would the world be a better place if the French rule the world ?    No.    First of all, no conqueror can hold an empire together because people cannot be united by force.  the world  will never allow itself to be unify because when there is yin, there will be yang. There will always be people, whose thinking is exactly the opposite as you.     Second, Hilter is Christian, who was taught like other Christian during his time that all Jews are Christ killer. That is why he hate Jews and that is why when he propose sending Jews to their death, no Christian in Germany felt that it is a bad idea. ( Some of them felt that it is bad when they realize they are losing the war and they may be trial for war crimes.)    Third, promotion of intolerance will never make the world a better place because one of the problem with the world today is intolerance. Hilter promote intolerance.       Fourth, religions exploited people's insecurity cause by fear, uncertainty and doubt. Religion take money from people and provide people a false sense of security by providing them false answers to address their fear, uncertainty and doubt. One religion will not tolerate another religion because see others as competition for money. Monopoly of religion will ensure the largest market share and maximum revenue. As long as religion taught people to be intolerance, war and conflict will continue.|`|d6d6ba532d5982bcf991fac313dd88a1aa	Hitler grew increasingly delusional towards the end of the Third Reich.  He was making battle plans with armored divisions that had been routed weeks ago.    Let's take two historical turning points that were crucial to the defeat of Nazi Germany.    1.  The Battle of the Bulge  2.  The Battle of Stalingrad    Of the two, Stalingrad is more important I believe.  Hitler had an ideological reason to continue to throw hundreds of thousands of troops into the harsh winter of the Russian campaign to die freezing and under-equipped.  On the other side, he committed just about every still functioning armored division towards taking out the paratroopers at the Bulge.  He failed on both counts, but even if he didn't he wouldn't have lasted much longer.    There were too many people within the Nazi high command that thought Hitler had taken the country into madness.  News of the concentration camps couldn't have stayed secret forever, and would have spurred his generals and admirals with any shred of decency into action against him.  In addition, there were numerous assassination plots against him, one of which was carried out by Col. Stauffenberg - albeit unsuccessfully.    So in summary, even if Hitler did not lose these two pivotal battles and end up committing suicide in his bunker, he would have most likely been killed or incapacitated by his own military staff who were tired of seeing their troops sent to their deaths in nearly unwinnable campaigns.|`|wzmQ4glbaa	I don't think so because you can't control so many people. I mean individual people would have sealed emotions and some leader is probably going to get a group of people to go against the gov. and release everyone's emotional "bottlecap". I think if Hitler did conquer the world it would either be stable or not stable.

VA2Sb4Q8aa	Human existence con sits of three things. 1. BODY 2. MIND 3. INTELLECT. Imagination is the result when all the three come in operation together. Even if one is not there there cannot be imagination. Therefore Imagination is the sum total of human existence; and therefore the most powerful gift given to human beings. We are talking of creating things with mind. In fact as per the Hindu system of ADVETA (NON-DUALITY) the whole universe is created by the mind of BRAHMA the creator. Taking this matter further every human being is creating his own world; may be in dreams. Just imagine a man dreaming That he is travelling in a train. In the dream he experiences the train, the movement of train, the noise of train etc. While that man was dreaming the train  and travel in the train was a reality. Now there are some question need to be answered. How the huge train could become reality in the brain or head less that a foot wide? During the dream when the man experienced all the sensations, was it not a reality?  This is a very wast subject. It needs lot of introspection rather than reading the books.|`|2scdUqkMaa	Talk to Stephen King or Dean Koonts or any number of people who write novels.

He said, if you look at a piece of paper, and spend some time looking, you will notice maybe one corner is a little bent, the paper is thicker on one end, the lines show through the paper when you hold it up to the light, etc.... So long as you keep looking, you will find things about that paper that you didn't see before. Eventually, usually fairly quickly, you will start to feel disturbed by the fact that this little peice of paper keeps changing and growing in detail under your wavering gaze. Soon the whole reality of that paper will become extremely upsetting. He calls this nausea.    If you imagine a piece of paper, it has no secondary characteristics unless you ADD THEM. It is what you decide it is. No nausea, no conflict, no problem. Reality is problematic, so people resort to imagination for a sense of security. This can be a very dangerous game if taken to excess.    What I have always hated about the Matrix movies is that the "outer reality" is so much less dense than the inner reality of the Matrix itself. When I leave one reality into another and the new one has less detail and is less "nauseating" than the other, I know the "new" reality is the fake one. They never address the fact that the Matrix functions like a real world and the outer world functions like a fantasy.    Well imagination is no good, we'll have to take a stab at real life.|`|LJzHR4zhaa	Probably cause the imagination comes from our brain. That way you see how complicated, remarkable, perfect and fantastic beings we are. We are connected of body, spirit and brain. We don't know our limits and that's why we can't answer to this question. We don't know why is it, we know that it is. There are no limits, as long as we exist, limits are erased from our vocabulary, but world, also.   You don't know what will exist in future, you can't say it's unfair. You can only suppose. I mean, when we were brought to this world, us, humans, we lived in nature. Years past by and we developed. We had nothing, but our imagination. That imagination soon became reality. And so it kept going, we still developed and developed. We created a new, different world, but that doesn't mean it's something good. Like, technology, for example. Sometimes it's so much helpful, but sometimes it's more suicidal than normal.   Who knows what will happen in the future. It's on us to decide, but, if you ask me, I'd rather live the present than the future. I'd rather not worry with this question, I'd rather live to find an answer to it.

An important (but obvious) thing I've learnt is that not everyone enjoys reading the same type of story; you can't please everyone.

Eight rules for writing fiction:    Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.   Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.   Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.   Every sentence must do one of two things  reveal character or advance the action.   Start as close to the end as possible.   Be a sadist. Now matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them  in order that the reader may see what they are made of.   Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.   Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.|`|f4Nn0W1xaa	You can't really know if other people will like it. You have to have the courage of your convictions. I know that that is true because I never have and it has prevented me from ever trying.    You can do some market research, of course. You can follow trends and read publishing forums in your areas of interest. For now though, since you have the beginners learning curve to go through, you'd probably be best off taking the story you feel you know the best and want the most to work on and go with that. It'll teach you more than thinking about it ever will.       To your previous answer:  Bertrand Russell would credit his sources. Those are not your rules. Those belong to Kurt Vonnegut. Plagiarism is thoroughly unpleasant, not to mention disreputable.
egRullZPaa	One idea is to start at the end of your story, what happens in the last chapter, and outline your plot backwards, writing down what event led to the one you just put down on paper.    By the way, there's more to a story than just a plot :-o  There's characters, setting, world building. You could try starting on something else, and not worry about the specifics of the plot. Build your world first. Decide on characters and what they're like, think about them and your world and see if a plot develops.      Sometimes I start with a rough idea of the plot, but as I actually start writing the novel the plot changes. I get to know the characters more, different ideas come up as I discuss my novel with others.      Some writers are organic writers. They don't sweat over what the plot is, they just sit down and write what comes to them. You could try that too.Maybe there is a great plot line buried somewhere inside your mind, just waiting to come to the fore. Perhaps its just waiting for you to start the story.    Plot is important. Your novel won't go anywhere without a pretty air tight one. But you can start writing without having a clear view of which direction it's going to go.      If you really can't think of a plot, try sitting down with a group of friends and brainstorming it.|`|l6ajMoVFaa	describe the worst date of your life  write about a time you lost something important to you  write about a prom. anyone's prom. maybe even your parents  take the reader behind the wheel of the worst driver you've ever known  a story that begins with, "why didn't you call me?"  a characer who is trying to gain access to a private club or organization  Begin a story with, "The last time I saw my mother was 15 years ago."

1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	"Danny Champion of the World" by Roald Dahl  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny,_the_...  "Danny's mother died suddenly when he was only four months old and from then on he lived with his father in an old Gypsy vardo at the back of a filling station, where his father fixed cars. By the time Danny was seven years old, he was able to take apart, and then put back together, a switch motor.    Danny's father owned the filling station, and it was the only piece of land for miles around that was not owned by a wealthy but unpleasant local man called Mr. Victor Hazell. After Mr. Hazell threatened Danny and Danny's father subsequently refused to give him service, Mr. Hazell attempted to have the father and son run off their land. This caused Danny's father to bear a grudge against Mr. Hazell. When Danny was nine years old he woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't find his father, who has a dark secret. His father went to poach pheasants from Hazell's Wood. Danny's father then let Danny in on a secret of poaching: pheasants love raisins, and placing a raisin inside a 'sticky hat' (a piece of paper rolled into a cone shape with glue on the inside) is the perfect trap in which to catch a pheasant. Another trick that Danny's dad taught him was the Horse-Hair Stopper. You had to stick in a horse's tailhair in raisins and when the pheasant tries to swallow it, it wouldn't go down his throat. As a result, the raisin will stick to the inside of his throat and he won't move his feet.    One evening, Danny's father went poaching and promised to be back no later than 10:30 p.m. Danny, waking later that night, discovers his father's absence. Fearing the worst, he sets out into the woods to find him, trapped down a hole with a broken ankle, and is able to rescue him by virtue of a customer's car.    While Danny's father is recovering from his injury, they hear that Mr. Hazell's pheasant-shooting party is approaching. They decide to humiliate him by luring all the pheasants away from the forest, so there will be no pheasants to shoot. Danny suggests that they should put the contents of sleeping tablets inside raisins which the pheasants will then eat, and when this is done they hide the sleeping pheasants in a local woman's house by taking a taxi. The woman then brings all the sleeping pheasants in a baby cradle.  As she is walking toward them, the pheasants began to wake up and fly, but they droopily fall back down. An angry Hazell arrives at the filling station just as the pheasants are waking up. With the help of Sgt. Samways, William and Danny herd the groggy birds onto Hazell's car, ruining the paintwork (and interior). Once the pheasants have woken completely, they fly away from the scene - in the opposite direction from Hazell's wood.    Danny is hailed as a champion by his father and Sgt. Samways, but their victory is a bittersweet one, due to the fact that all the pheasants flew away.

But, before you read that, do yourself a HUGE favor and read the brilliant chapter on Descartes by TZ Lavine in her book "From Socrates to Sarte (1984)."  I highly recommend this book, and it is the best single volume history of Philosophy, ranking right under the great Will Durant introduction "The Story of Philosophy (1921)," which I also hightly recommend.    Then read, "Rules for the Direction of the Mind" and "Treatise on Man."      After that, you might want to read "Man a Machine" by La Mettrie.|`|j4a5kiu5aa	Discourse on the Method.|`|Cf8VzXVZaa	I would actually take a look at some of his natural philosophy works, such as Le Monde and Optics and A Treatise on Man. It's pretty interesting how he put all this stuff together, and actually much of it is generally correct (Optics), with modern verification. Or at least more in tune with modern findings than other philosopher's theories, including the empiricists.    But after a brief glance at those, start with Discourse on Method. That is where he mentions "I think therefore I am" in that particular form. After Discourse, move to the Meditations where he states it a bit differently. Finally conclude with the Passions of the Soul, his last work, inspired by Princess Elizabeth whom he fell in love with.     Enjoy|`|iBQ0LF4Daa	Meditations.

t7K7ETfgaa	what do you need to know? his relationship with lady macbeth?  basically it is very loving, he cares for his wife, calls her his "partner in greatness" and once he finds out this news from the oracles, he shares it with her at once and promises her greatness for their future. but lady macbeth is more greedy and evil spirited than one would think, and macbeth is not. (this is, of course how they are at the beginning of the story making their moral change later on ironic).  Lady Macbeth convinces Macbeth to murder the king to get what they want, when Macbeth was simply going to let things unfold and let fate play it's part. So their relationship is loving, but Lady Macbeth becomes a creature of darkness when she is overcome by greed and tortures her husband into doing the deed.  she tests his faith in their marriage, and his manhood, all to get him to give into her desires and murder the king to get what it is she desires.  then later on in the story, Macbeth becomes insane with power and goes on a killing spree, killing all those who hold any possible threat to him, but in a unecessarily violent way.  he kills the guards they framed for killing the king, he sends murderers after Banquo and his son, then has the murderers killed, he also has McDuff's family, servants, and entire household slaughtered simply to torture McDuff.  Then it is Lady Macbeth, who was initially welcoming darkness and wishing to be desexed to become a creature of darkness, who feels the guilt in the end and it tortures her soul 'til she has nightmares and sleep walks/talks every night ,then she commits suicide.  When she commits suicide, we see that their relationship has changed drastically becuase Macbeth hardly takes notice.  We first see a change in their relationship when Macbeth plans to have Banquo and his son killed without telling Lady Macbeth.  They used to be partners, but now he keeps things from her and has become, himself, and moreso than she, a creature of darkness.  So we see it go from a loving relationship, to torn by power of greed, to no longer partners, to not even caring about the other's death.

QE71sNC3aa	It's easier to get an electric guitar to sound like an acoustic than it is to make an acoustic sound like an electric. There are acoustic electric guitars. But, they're mainly for making amplification or recording easier. They won't excel at heavier overdriven electric guitar sounds.    Choose the instrument that's most capable of the sound you wish to play. Otherwise, you'll soon grow bored and quit.    Problem is... That's kind of a tight budget for an electric guitar and an amp... The "Jam Packs" of the decent brands start at around $200.00 for an electric guitar and amp from Epiphone, Ibanez, etc....  You could get a nice Yamaha, Epiphone or Ibanez acoustic for around $100.00. Maybe a little more for a "Jam Pack" that includes a gig bag for the guitar and some accessories.    If you want to go electric... you're going to have a tough time on that budget. You could get a Dean for around $100.00. Korg makes a tuner for around $15.00 that's very good... Maybe you could start by plugging it into your computer's mic jack for amplification. The software for many sound cards includes distortion and other effects for guitars. You'd need a 1/4" to 1/8" adapter for your guitar cord.    As you can afford it.... you could add a little amp. You're either going to want a basic amp and some effects pedals or a multi-effects processor to get the kind of sounds you're looking for out of an electric... Or an amp with some nice built-in effects like a Line 6 Spider.    You may be able to find some sort of lesser-known brand of electric guitar package in your price-range online or at a discount store or something... Some of these really aren't that bad. I'd stay away from anything with a tremolo system (whammy bar) in the lower price ranges. These guitars will not stay in tune. It's better to go with a fixed bridge in any guitar under about $300.00. A combo in that price-range would have a very basic amp. But, you could later add a multi-effects processor from DigiTech or another brand to enable getting heavy distortions, delays and all kinds of other effects.    A pro set-up by a shop that sets up / repairs guitars is recommended when you can afford it for any guitar you buy. Guitars in that price range generally leave the factory playable, but not tweaked to perfection. A pro can often lower the strings and adjust the neck to make playing easier and the sound better on an acoustic or an electric. A little money very well spent on any guitar.    It absolutely does make sense to get a decent guitar for a beginner. If it doesn't stay in tune or sound good, you'll quit or the money will be wasted and you'll have to buy something better. How do you learn if your guitar doesn't sound like it's supposed to? Why bother playing if no matter how hard you try it sounds bad? The whole point of a guitar is that it's supposed to sound good when you play it. Not too sure why anybody would want one that doesn't. Those cheap Strat copies with the tremolo bridges are about the worst thing you could buy. You'll be lucky if you can get it tuned properly for a minute or two. The fixed bridge from Dean is a much better guitar and about the same price. Unfortunately, no package with an amp is available. You would be FAR better off buying decent gear as you can afford it than throwing your money away on garbage. A decent guitar that stays in tune is a must. Paying a little more for an amp with some built-in effects or a separate multi-effects processor will allow you to sound a lot more like what you hear in recordings and make playing MUCH more rewarding and fun.    I know you probably want to hear that you can go out and buy a nice electric combo for $100.00... but you just can't and you're getting some very poor advice here.  Saying a garbage guitar is fine for a beginner is just plain foolish. Garbage is garbage and there is absolutely no use on Earth for a guitar that doesn't sound good for anyone, particularly a beginner who would likely just lose interest in playing due to a poor quality instrument.|`|7VpDEkC6aa	In your budget range I can only think of one place that you could find a (hopefully) good guitar. Their stuff doesn't look all that bad. It's easier to get an electric guitar that you can adjust to play well, even if it's cheap.  Acoustic guitars can be a little more temperamental. However if you want an acoustic-electric guitar (which as the other guy said, doesn't really sound electric, although you could get a distortion box, and it would sound more like an electric guitar) they have this:  http://www.rondomusic.com/eag1k.html   It is a complete package with guitar, amp, cord and guitar bag.   It even has a built in tuner.    For a good sounding electric guitar,  This page has a bunch of different Stratocaster copies that look pretty good too.  Also a complete package for under 120.  http://www.rondomusic.com/electricguitar...    Strats can be made to sound very much like an acoustic if you use a "clean" amp setting and use the pickup closest to the neck.  They are the most versatile guitar. I've played strats for over 30 years.      If you are kinda on the small side you can also get a "short scale" guitar which is the same as a regular guitar, but built just a little bit smaller, so smaller people can play more easily.    I know that a lot of folks will turn their noses up at cheap guitars, but if you are beginner, it doesn't make sense to spend a whole lot of money.    And like I said, most electric guitars can be adjusted in a lot of ways to make them play easier. Especially those Stratocaster copies.    This site has tons of guitars in your price range.    Here is the main page:  http://www.rondomusic.com/|`|ivGzzGOdaa	yamaha and fender make good low priced guitars with better quality than other guitar co. epiphone is good.|`|XUwtAWzkaa	Start with acoustic, try guitar center, they have large sales recently and your sure to find something you love.|`|20KORDX8aa	Get electric starter pack you don't have to use a amp all the time|`|94MyeH19aa	You don't have to start on acoustic, just don't get the electric and play around with distortion and cool sounds and famous riffs and forget to learn other stuff. I got a Squier Strat, so have lots of my friends that play, it's a copy of Fender Stratocaster but cheaper and to start with you wont notice the difference. About $150Australian i think it was. If you get an acoustic first youll either have to spend a lot more for 2 guitars or you'll end up waiting years to get the electric but if you like it and its a hobby youll probably get a few guitars later on anyway. An electric costs more too coz theres an amp as well, so if you get a $100 guitar youll pay 200 i guess, depends what you buy. also buy the guitar on what type of music you like, the squier i have is good for rock and blues, but it cant make the thick crunchy metal sounds. if you like that get a guitar with humbuckers (a type of pickup).    and for the guitar that sounds like an electric and an acoustic, it could be an acoustic guitar with microphone like things (pickups) in the soundhole, so you can plug it in and its got an  acoustic sound. (i dont know about them much though). or it could be a hollow body electric, which is the same as a normal electric but i think its got a more echoey tone. or it could be a normal electric guitar, and when you plug into most amps, theres a settting that says 'clean,' you turn that on and its almost like an acoustic, its not distorted at least. Or, there is an effects pedal that can make an electric guitar sound acoustic, an effects pedal's something you plug the guitar into, then you plug the pedal into your amp with another cord, and on the pedal, its got some dials and switches to change the sound, for this it would switch between acoustic and normal electric sound. I dont know much about that guitar though look into it more maybe. Also, acoustic guitar has thicker strings and thicker body, and other differences i dont know, so even if you get an electric that sounds acoustic, its still not the same.    You could buy a better guitar 2nd hand too, if the first owner hasnt smashed it up, you can just replace the pickups, fretboard, strings, machine heads etc if its too bad.    Go to your music store for more help though theyre pros and they can answer all your questions its way easier than this.

e221ab6e424181e56de41ddeec997728aa	The Third Estate was the third chamber (representing the middle classes) in the French Parliament (Estates-General) until the French Revolution of 1789. The EG was called in 1789 to vote to address the economic crisis. It had 3 chambers/estates, and 2 of them had to agree to pass legislation. The other 2 estates where the nobility and the clergy. However the EG eventually took the "Tennis Court Oath", declaring they were no longer the Third Estate but rather the National Assembly/Parliament of France. The other two estates members eventually joined the new National Assembly too. The king send troops into Paris and intended dissolving the chamber, but soldiers mutinied and the king was forced to back down.

ckrh0iJSaa	If you're not living there full-time, the chances of an LA agency signing you are very, very low.  Especially if you're on the other side of the country.  Every state has a market, but the only truly good ones are LA (tv and film) and New York (stage).  Chicago is also good for stage.  Auditions can come up at any time and they need you to be able to get there ASAP.  Agencies won't take a risk putting all their effort into finding auditions for someone who probably won't make it in time, and may not afford all the plane fare.  LA is the best place to get film and tv work.  That said, yes there is a lot of competition.  More competition for females especially.  You need to do this research on what you need to do on your own, by researching and looking through books and websites for answers from actual professionals who write them.  Research all the scams out there so that you don't fall for them.  You will be much more satisfied getting answers from professionals, not from just people on Yahoo answers.  I would highly recommend actorsaccess.com, and backstage.com.  Both have the best articles for learning about the business.  If you move to LA, first thing you'll want to do is get a reputable, well-known acting coach... Also, many people come out here and "try."  It's not about just trying, it's about knowing what you're getting into, being intelligent about the craft and the business and the city, loving what you do and not just doing it for fame, and never giving up even after all the years of rejection it takes.  I swear, people come here thinking that they'll be "discovered" by some director as they walk along Hollywood Boulevard, or stand outside movie studios.  Doesn't happen.  Not saying you're one of those people, but make sure you stay away from them.  Be ready, be prepared, and know that you have to sacrifice so so much to seriously pursue a career in acting.  Talent, presentation, representation, and persistence-- I've heard those are the keys to success in the acting world.  Best wishes.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Call Rainbow Casting in Burbank and discuss this with them.  Try Central Casting probably in LA or surrounding areas.

On top of that, with the slowing economy and threat of SAG strike business has been at a virtual standstill which has been very tough on the medium to small size agencies. It's always a given that there are too many actors for too few jobs but what's going on now is severe.     LA however is not your only option. New York City because of it's generous tax credits has been attracting a lot of TV and film production, you might consider a move there.     In any case, whether you choose LA or NYC, you will have to move before you make any overtures to agents. My recommendation is you go on a strict savings diet. You want to land in either city with as much money in the bank as you can to smooth your transition and grit out the pavement pounding that will have to happen while you try to find your feet in either city.
JB93S2PXaa	Hi!I love chick lit and cinderella stuff too.    anw i would like to recommend you the book called "where rainbow ends" by cecelia ahern. i find it very romantic, it is about a boy and girl who are best frens and liked each other all the way but nv confess their love to each other.    the book is written in the form of emails and instant messages forwarded to each other which is rather different and interesting.    anw since u mentioned you like normal plain jane meets famous guy kind of story line, i recommend books by louise bagshaw.    i usually like reading her books cos her leads characters are usually normal girls who are in a setting where they get to meet glamourous ppl like movie stars, directors, models etc.    oh yea, jane green's books are not bad too. for more romantic one, i guess u can try "Mr Maybe".

AA11086644	I know you probably don't want to be rude. You like being a nice person but don't want to be anyone's doormat either, right? That's a legitimate dilemma, especially for us ladies.    I suggest when a situation presents itself where you feel pressured or expected to submit or bow out, just remain silent. Don't make a fuss one way or the other, don't offer to give up your seat, your pen, your place in the group, etc.  When that doesn't work and someone explicitly asks you (which will happen a lot), politely decline and kindly state your legitimate reasons.    "hey, would you mind making another group"  "well actually I think it would fair if I stayed. I've made another group for the last few times, maybe we can take turns--I wanna hang out with you guys this time"    Now be warned, my dear, many people are NOT going to like this. They have gotten used to stepping over you and getting what they want and will resent your for saying no or sticking up for yourself. You will have to learn to deal with this.   If you explain your reasons for sticking to your guns and they STILL are upset, that's their problem and you will have to deal with possibly losing certain friends. Don't take this personally or let it get to you. If someone can only be your friend if they can get their way, they are not your friend and they need to be cut loose, okay? It is critical that you stick to your guns when you really feel you're being pressured. It's okay to acquiesce sometimes and take one for the team, but it needs to be understood that you're doing it because you're a thoughtful person, not because you don't have a say in the matter.    Also know that people will try to manipulate and guilt you when you say no. They'll beg, ask why not, say "well you did it last time" or give you dirty looks or say rude things. Just ignore it and stand your ground. It is critical that at this juncture in your life as a smart young woman, you learn to stand up for yourself and cope with some people not liking it.  You have to make yourself happy.  And I said that you can explain yourself, say that you'd rather not, or whatever, and that's true. But remember that you don't OWE anyone an explanation. Don't let anyone make you feel like you have to defend yourself or your right to do what you want.  Stay strong and remember that you'll be better off without the people who may leave, and the friends who stick around (and most will) will respect you more for it.    Good luck honey!!

When thy Lord drew forth from the Children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants, and made them testify concerning themselves, (saying): "Am I not your Lord (Who cherishes and sustains you)?"- They said: "Yea! We do testify!"

He will take your troubles and pain away from you as you have to believe that he will provide for you as you read his word, his word is Truth and the way to Truth is though his life the way to salvation in the Bible.We live to tell others about our lives so that we can save someone or to give sound advice to others.We all much do things correctly to mbe an example to tohers of how Christ lived and died to save others so they would not burn in Hell.God is the Father of us all, He IS the Father who created us all, we must obney his words as If you had Christ in your life, you would not ask this question.We all have to die sometimes, but after life we have new bodies and no more pain or suffering.The more you read the Bible, the more you understand why you asked this question. Have a great week, and remember, God loves you, Jesus died for you and loves you alot, and I love you.|`|VA2Sb4Q8aa	First of all GOD has not ordered anything. In Hindu sacred book GEETA, the Ultimate Teacher Lord Krishna tell the most eligable learner Arjuna as follows " Thus the "Wisdom" which is greater secret than all secrets, has been declared to you by ME; having reflected upon it fully, you now act as you choose". Here it can be seen that GOD Krishna has given full freedom to his desciple Arjuna to "Act as you choose".   Second point is death. Anything that is born has to die. There is no justice or injustice about it.   At the time of birth, the time, place and location of death is destined.  We are all bound by laws of KARMA.  Third points is "Did we want to born?" Yes we wanted to be born. After death the ATMA (Spirit) rests. It is guided by other holy beings. The spirit comes back to be reborn as per its own wish. Therefore it chooses the place of birth, the parents and life it wants to lead. The aim of every spirit, including you and me is to attain the state of "NIRVANA" or "MOKSHA". This cannot be done in one life. It takes several lives. It is said that BUDHA had to take more than 2500 births to reach BUDHAHOOD.

9bb9d9f875252d0bd072744b016f3817aa	Obedience in Thought:  Nice simile and metaphor usage throughout, especially liked the last stanza very interesting message you're trying to convey. I heard from a knowledgeable poet teacher one time that lines like "Simple curiosity may kill and daily I feel" actually hurt a poem's true message because it seems like there is a forced attempt at a rhyme, which compromises the voice of a poet and it takes focus away from the meaning and structure of the poem. Also, if this is free verse then job well done. If not, syllable matching for a rhyming poem might give it a better flow. (See Iambic pentameter)    Speed of Life  I see a lot of double meaning in this one, which is good because it allows the reader to create what he or she presumes the story to be. Given the shortness of the poem, there's little you can do to create a story and you do a good job of keeping it open, yet closed given the title.    The Knock  Again, a title can completely change the meaning and intentions of a poem. Since the poem is short, I'd recommend a changing of the title which can, in turn, give the reader a much better sense of where you wanted to go with the poem.    Modern Romance  It's simple, and it certainly has imagery. But consider changing the word forest (too simple, not modern really), and the term modern romance in the poem. If you changed that up, you could really add some "modern" visualizations instead of simple stating modern romance to give the reader even more of a feeling.    Nice Job overall, though. Just remember that with poetry, anyone can write down words and give them a cryptic open ended meaning. What separates the great from the good is the ability to gives words meaning to the reader in such a way that it pinpoints emotions, feelings, sentiments, memories, and inspiration through the very structure and exactness of the words you use.|`|k5OQQt2vaa	Man, Michael W got it exactly :)
dmWJbloTaa	that is very vague however i will attempt to answer it. Western cultures usually have an extremely democratic governments. As opposed to eastern cultures often have either a) a communist government or b) a traditional government (eg those found in such countries with islamic law) in general though there is very little difference. You could get into the UN charter and the Wests tendency to show more support than the Wests. also in a lot of eastern countries the main focus of campaign speeches are the poorer people in the country as there are many people below the poverty line in these countries. If you ever watch the 7 o'clock news you also see the political/civil wars as a result of the governments structural leadership styles. but other than that there is little difference.|`|550e4912823fee98e745442e7bdab33faa	Basic example of Western Leadership Style ( one of many)  "Follow Me Boys".
oqI7H1T9aa	Thats Mira Bai not Meera bhai!    She was the greatest ever devotee of Lord Krishna.    Look what Wikipedia says about MiraBai--      Mirabai (???????) (1498-1547CE) (alternate orthographies: Meera; Mira; Meera Bai) was a Hindu mystical poetess whose compositions are popular throughout India. Mirabai is held to have been a disciple of Ravidas. Mirabai composed between 200 to 1300 prayerful songs called bhajans. These bhajans are in the bhakti tradition, and most passionately praised Lord Krishna. The extant version of her poems are in a Rajasthani dialect of Hindi and in Gujarati.  Many of the details of Mirabai's life are pieced together from her poetry and the stories later recounted by members of her community. While Mirabai's hagiography is held as truth by followers of the bhakti tradition, the historical authenticity of most of her story is the subject of scholarly debate.      This is a piece of Introduction only. I did not wanted to make my Answer very long.

U66CDN2Taa	Orthogonal drawing involves drawing accurate specifications of a 3D object from fixed perspectives (at 90 degrees from each other) so as to make a clear blueprint from which to construct a design. These perspectives are typically from: directly above; from the front; and from the side  providing all the information you need to fabricate an object.    Isometric drawing presents a 3D object in a different way, using three axes that are separated by 120 degrees. Start with a vertical line, then measure with a protractor 120 degrees either way from one end and extend two more lines. These are your three axes / dimensions. Stick to angles of 30 and 120 degrees and start with simple shapes and you'll get the hang of it in no time.

Cf8VzXVZaa	He's not...    Maybe you meant father of modern philosophy. In which case he is considered the father of modern philosophy because he introduced the idea that all knowledge is the product of reasoning based on self-evident assumptions. Descartes was living in Holland when he published his first major work, Discourse on Method, in 1637. In this treatise (official discussion) he applied mathematical methods to science and philosophy. His concept of reasoning provided the foundation for modern philosophy, which dates from the 1600s to the present.|`|ncXImw6kaa	With all due respect, I believe that this question is incorrectly formulated.    Rene Descartes is not known as the father of philosophy, but is called by some the father of modern (Western) philosophy.    He accomplished this by locating the source of truth, and the ground of individual being, in the self-certain, self-conscious thinking subject.    By locating the ground of thought and truth in the `thinking-subject' Descartes decisively liberated philosophy from every sort of theological dogma and outwardly imposed historicosociological constraint.    I myself, however, believe that there are a number of different philosophers who can be said to have fathered different modern Western `philosophies,' or, better yet, `ways of philosophizing'.  But this would involve us in a different discussion.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Why is Descartes known as the funniest comedian in the catskills?  Why is Descartes known as a raincoat for all seasons?

NYU37jfGaa	Gothic architecture.  Astounding.  It produced buildings of such beauty, the great cathedrals that are still the glory of Europe, that they take your breath away.    And it is not true (as the comment above says) that there was no realistic looking art in medieval times.  On the contrary, there are some very beautiful paintings which look very realistic indeed.  Consider the work of Giotto for example, or some of the enchanting illustrations to be found in the Books of Hours that were produced, with their small and exquisite illustrations of medieval life.|`|b620ee9ffe6252c90305858258e1bd65aa	Printing?     During the Middle Ages, European artists painted in a way that emphasized religious images and symbolism rather than realism. Most paintings depicted scenes holy figures and people important in the Christian religion. Even the most talented painters of the Middle Ages paid little attention to making humans and animals look lifelike, creating natural looking landscapes, or creating a sense of depth and space in their paintings.  http://www.mos.org/sln/Leonardo/Painting...  http://www.historylink101.com/lessons/ar...

Short poems with one basic conceit  like this, are hard to make cohere w/o adding more stuff and ruining the simplicity at the core.  (Hard for me, anyway.)    I love the way you *don't* use punctuation.  You let the line breaks do that work for you and that adds to the cleanness of this poem.    I'm ambivalent about the word "remodel".  I alternate between loving it and thinking there is something better.  If I had been writing this poem (gawd forbid), I would have used the work "inform" in its place.  But I realize I'm moving away from that central simple cleanness you've set up, with the philosophical overtones that "inform" has.    Remold.  Recast.  Realign. Supplant.  Replace.  No.    Remodel is probably the best word for the concept.    I loved it!|`|AA11267193	You do goood.    Now you've got me thinking...What would be a metaphor for my father?

I have met Jesus several times - nice guy, great ideas - he didn't save me from anything.  In this life, I've yet to do something to be forgiven for, if you catch my meaning.  Love is real *but can be really fickle, too*, but ALL religions were invented and fine-tuned by US.  Religion is for the feeble-minded, those that collect Santa figurines & believe a child was born to a virgin, yet denounce, well - I'll stop there.  Love is real.|`|2eCmyfH2aa	yes.

c2f7ef4507c724db34ebbcc925ef59e1aa	It sounds like what you really need is Adobe/Macromedia Flash. It's an animation programme what does everything you want. Using it, you can change the frame rate so that it doesn't run too quickly, and you can use actionscript at the end of the animation... gotoAndPlay(1); to make it repeat. You can also select multiple frames and move them about as you wish.    It would take me all day to tell you how to work Flash but you may be able to find a free trial online, and there are plenty of tutorial websites such as Entheos.    Hope this helps!

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi    Usually on a nylon classical guitar, you use the thumb on the down-stroke and the index or middle-finger on the up-stroke.    That way, it will sound smooth and actually more pleasing to the ear. You should look for Videos on youtube of Flamenco Guitar players. That will give you a good idea of how it sounds without the pick, and the way it should be strummed.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	ive retrained guitarists who only could finger pick and they always say what you say.  keep at it and it will sound nicer, work some basic strumming pattern and start with only one chord.  a thin pick is fine.  its takes a few thousand times to get good at something so your not there yet.  once you strum a few hundred times you'll get better though and you'll be strumming alot more everyday.  it won't take long just keep it up|`|QXQWDw1qaa	First of all HIRE A GUITAR TEACHER... you don't know enough about playing a guitar to do what you are trying to do.    I have a Taylor NS34CE that I play all the time.  I almost NEVER use a pick on it because, to me, a classical guitar is all about technique and warm sounds.. they are NOT for shreading.  There are only a few songs that need the raw sound I can get from a pick.    I also have a MARTIN Acoustic and THAT guitar is ALWAYS played with a Pick.    HIRE A TEACHER..,. then you can learn some basics and get a better start than what you are trying to do for free off the internet.|`|XOgvpDiZaa	Classical guitars are not meant to be strummed with a pick; use your thumb.
Ow3O7h4caa	Hi Tom    Your wrist is not suppose to hurt whatsoever. You have to push down on the pick , and life up with the index. That way, it produces a tiny circle movement. The wrist is used in conjunction wit the up and down stroke of the fingers movement.  YOu should practice economy-picking. ONce you master this technique, you will triple your speed in weeks. WIt a daily practice and perseverence, you should be able to play quite well in a year's time.    Practice alternate-picking and combine it with economy-picking. The secret is to use one finger per fret technique. This way, each finger has its position and eventually, it will be done automatically.|`|QXQWDw1qaa	The FIRST thing you need to do is HIRE A TEACHER so you can LEARN THE BASICS.. which you OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW.

BCrEyeTbaa	you can't really "learn" how to rave. so i'm sorry to say that your friends may be posers XD anyways so like the guy above me said, if you are going to a REAL rave then your friends would have to have connections with the underground party starters to know where to go! otherwise your just going to a goth club. Now, to your question. Since you can't learn to rave then i suppose your friends would be talking about some type of glow toy. probably glow poi. in that case there is NO way that you will be able to learn that before the party, it takes a long time just to learn the basics of poi! plus there won't be any space to do it. so my advice is just chill, dance, and have a good time|`|YJZ8W4QBaa	OK THERE IS NO SET WAY ON HOW TO RAVE  you are either a RAVER or not....!!  when you get there,be YOURSELF,everyone there will be doing there own thing and you will soon see that no body at raves cares about how anyone else is dancing!!!  so go relax and (RIP IT OUT OF IT) XXX|`|gQtbwpyCaa	just dance go to the music, no one cares wen ur there everyone is just loved up haha!|`|4Al9aapdaa	Internet?? youtube is where alot of my friends go to learn how to do all the cool moves with the light thingys lol , im sorry tthat'sthe best i can think of.. raves are too intense for me :P just have fun, and good luck :)|`|AA10645224	THERE IS NO SUCH THING ABOUT HOW TO RAVE    JUST GO AND DO YOU    AND DON'T DRINK THE YELLOW STUFF (It's probably piss)

4Al9aapdaa	I think that if its something you love then do it!! if its something you enjoy then of course its not a waste of time. A waste of time would be studying something like law when you absolutely hate it. People today are so driven by Money they give up on their dreams. We live in a society where we are brought up to aspire to be people like lawyers and doctors or anyone that will make lots of money.. If you were to ask most people today if they would rather be doing something else i bet alot of them would say yes... I know personally ive been shot down by my parents many times when ive told them want to do acting being one of the things.. my mom totally discouraged it when i was younger despite the fact i loved it... now because i listened to them and not myself im stuck 5 years later trying to get back into it...

ZjqdLSv2aa	As a filmmaker I can tell you this - there is no average.    It all depends on who you're connected to (if anyone), your acting range, your look, your personality, where you live, etc., etc..    Here's a helpful hint though: You are considered to be a pretty successful actor if you land at least one out of every 20 roles you audition for.    So, if you want to be successful, then you better start referring to the casting couch as your second home.|`|vLF2uz9saa	none maybe some it depends on how much time u have and who ur agent is.|`|AA11480859	If you are serious about acting and getting in the biz then every time there is a audition or script reading you need to be there, whether it's for a movie or a commercial, if there's 5 in one day then you try your best to be at every one, there's never "too many" auditions and as long as you remember that you 'll do just fine.|`|7kvTHzj0aa	one of koreas top drama actors had to audition 213 times in a row before he got any part. but it was totaly worth it now that hes super popular and rich.

I think, one should follow one's life calling (because it is unusual) if there is one.    Having said that, there is a school of thought that says that you can have both. Have a practical career first (and earn some money so that you can support yourself). At the same time (if you have enough time), or later in your life, you can have a second career (=your life calling).    It has been said that careers only last 10 years of one's life. Our working life is 30-40 years long. If this is the case, then you can certainly have more than one career... maybe two, three or four.    Good luck!|`|QDrAGIOeaa	Yes, every day.

It don't help people and no matter how hard I work, I am not appreciated by anyone. I was overwork, underpaid and suffer from burnout. I was very depress and felt the need for a career change.    I feel that my job should be meaningful in the sense that it will help and benefit people. So I studied for an IT degree and made a career switch nine years ago. Now I work as a programmer, creating software solutions to solve problems in my company's daily operations.  I help people do their daily job in a less tedious, more productive and more efficient ways.     If you feel that you have made a mistake, it is not too late to change.  However, in this economy crisis, you should make the career switch after you have found your new job.
xU7AaQOdaa	Iago: Othello's ancient, a position below lieutenant. Perhaps Shakespeare's most evil figure, not for his treachery which is arguably surpassed by Macbeth (who kills his king in his sleep while staying at his castle as a trusting guest), but for the manner in which he effortlessly manipulates all those around him to do his bidding (kill Cassio, destroy Othello, discredit Desdemona's virtue) by taking advantage of their trust and using his victim's own motivations (Roderigo's desire for Desdemona, Cassio's desire to be reinstated) and weaknesses (Othello's pride, Cassio's impaired judgment whilst drunk), to achieve his ends.     Though Iago does kill when he stabs and murders Roderigo, he created most of his devastation through the use of others who unwittingly follow their own agenda which Iago subverts to achieve a web of events which succeeds in making Cassio first lose his position as Othello's lieutenant, then petition Desdemona to be reinstated which allows Iago to suggest Desdemona's adultery and later to motivate Roderigo to kill him (Cassio).     Iago's character is complex, but in Act I, Scene I, where he describes his disgust at being overlooked for Othello's lieutenant, we can see that a primary motivation for Iago's skillful manipulations was revenge and anger; revenge for Cassio replacing him, anger that Othello overlooked him. Thus it can be seen that Iago's manipulations are driven by a basic desire to avenge those who hurt him but also to gain what he believes is his, indeed Iago's suggestion that Cassio and Desdemona are having an affair earns Iago Othello's trust and the position as his lieutenant in Act III, Scene III.     However being made lieutenant only satisfies his pride, his continuing with his plan to discredit Desdemona shows us that it is not enough for Iago to have what he believes is his, he must punish Othello for overlooking him in the first place by making Othello disbelieve and destroy his virtuous wife...    Iago is pragmatic. We see this in the manner in which he uses opportunity to aid his plan to hurt Cassio and Othello. When Iago realizes Cassio's admiration of Desdemona, he immediately formulates a plan to use this to make Othello suspect adultery.    Though Iago appears to have the goal of misery for Othello and Cassio, he does not appear to have a specific detailed plan, he continually refers to using insights he makes about Cassio, Othello, Roderigo and Desdemona to further his plan in his asides in the play.    Iago's pragmatism is also evident in his use of Roderigo. He uses this well-healed (wealthy) Venetian for money by promising to forward gifts on to Desdemona he instead uses for his own ends.    However when Roderigo suspects this in Act V, he plots to have Roderigo kill Cassio since if Cassio wins, he still wins by having Roderigo eliminated. Ultimately this fails, so Iago kills Roderigo himself.    Cunning in the extreme, Iago nearly gets away with his plan; Othello does kill Desdemona, Iago is made lieutenant, but Cassio despite his attack in Act V, lives and he (Iago) is eventually caught and exposed.     If Iago has an Achilles heal, it was his wife Emilia, who despite threats and orders from Iago, revealed to all Iago's treachery by declaring Desdemona's innocence and explaining how she found Desdemona's handkerchief, passing it on to Iago... For this Iago shows his total ruthlessness by killing Emilia and escaping, only to be later caught.    Though Iago appears to be managing everyone else's insecurities to his personal advantage, Iago does indeed have his own insecurities, lending credibility to his character since no man is immune from insecurity or indeed misjudgment.     Iago shows his insecurity by his need to be made lieutenant, which reveals his own desire to reach a status he seems to need to be comfortable.     Likewise, in Act II, Scene I, when Iago reveals that he suspects Othello is having an affair with his wife Emilia as a peripheral motivation for manipulating Othello, he again shows his insecurity, one which he uses in Othello against Desdemona.     Iago's great misjudgment of course is of his own wife. She stands up to him to defend Desdemona despite all the risks it entails, unraveling Iago's web of manipulation.    At the end of the play, Iago differs from many of Shakespeare's villains in that he is left standing, if guarded; most villains in Shakespeare's plays tend to die at the hands of those they oppressed in a recurring theme of restoration of order. Iago by contrast does not die, we can only speculate that his future will be miserable...|`|DvToP5h7aa	Othello, Moor of Venice - Study Guides:    http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/w...    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/oth/    http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ot...    http://absoluteshakespeare.com/guides/ot...    http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xOthe...

The reason he treats Emilia so badly may be that he blames her for their dysfunctional marriage. She an example of a woman being treated as would be common in Elizabethan/Jacobean times, not as submissive as her husband might think and acting independently when the cause was sufficient.      2)   Iago displays a clear arrogant attitude towards women  he views them as subordinate and the inferior sex. Much to the dismay of Desdemona and Emilia, he expresses his views on women as merely sexual objects; there to satisfy mans desires: You rise to play/And go to bed to work. Furthermore, at the end of the play, Iago murders his own spouse, indicating his hatred for women. He views his own wife as merely a servant rather than a companion. This is a direct parallel with the views of Othello towards Desdemona. This is used by Shakespeare to show the differences of attitude in two characters that are both highly regarded in Venetian society.      3)   Iago resents the privilege that Cassio represents, and Iago equates this with a lack of manliness.  We see this in the opening scene when he calls Cassio bookish and a spinster (1.1.23) while he himself, an experienced soldier, passed overAnd I, God bless the mark, his Moorships ancient!      This is also why his anger seems so excessive when Cassio acts mannerly with Desdemona, patronizing Iago as he does so:  Let it not gall your patience, good Iago, / That I extend my manners; tis my breeding / That gives me this bold show of courtesy (2.1.97-99).  Iago cannot stand it.     We see this  class feeling again in Act 5 when Gratiano and Lodovico have forgotten his name:  these bloody accidents must excuse my manners / That so neglected you. (5.1.93-95). Here he apes the courtesy that Cassio says Iago lacks (Act 2). Because he wants to be accepted as an equal, he addresses Cassio as brother (5.1.71).      Therefore, his bitterness at Cassio springs not so much from disappointment over not being promoted on just this one occasion as from his general sense that he is not acceptable as officer material.  He compensates for these humiliations, the daily beauty of privilege that makes me ugly (5.1.20).|`|2cBVWVkvaa	1) Iago doesn't trust anyone, and during the play he convinces himself that Emilia is cheating on him with othello, he makes himself believe it even though its not true at all. All she wants wants to do is make her marriage work and that's why she helps him not knowing what Iago is really like. You really see her character right at the end of the play, and see the fault in Iago's master plan by letting Emilia help  2) He treats everyone the same way, he stays away from them as well as everybody else even as u nohiss wife. ItsCasioo whodoesn'tt treat some women right like the character of Bianca.   3) Iago is provoked by cassio because he got the promotion to lieutenantt that he wanted. Just for that he hates cassio, othello and the whole world.    Thats basically what it is...hope it helped :P

Use a color like green to trace around on the INSIDE of the letters.     Use a color like yellow to color in the inside and blend the green and the yellow together. (try overlapping the colors on a different piece of paper to see different ways you can achieve that.)     You might want to leave places white in your letters for little highlights. (if you can gray-up areas... that looks good too.)    You might want to make the first letter a solid color like red. or if you are using and Xs in your word, color those all red.    Finally, leave a very very thick white border around the entire thing (since you are using marker, you will have to put things behind it so you can tell where the white border is.) Otherwise, you could just thicken up the black around the outside...     that's a pretty common graffiti style.    try looking at this graphic: http://www.actden.com/grap_den/lesson1/c...

This treaty offered her large territories in Tyrol, Dalmatia, and Istria.  The only problem was, that such gains depended on Italian military success.  As it was, Italy was forced into several situations where she had to face large odds (eg., face the whole Austrian-Hungarian army + German forces alone), and after the demoralizing loss at Capretto, there was little progress....Italy ended up giving up too much for too little: 600,000 dead, 250,000 permanently wounded, greater expenses than for the last 40 years altogether; and all for just a little piece of the Tyrol.

You have to experiment with them, and shake them up again at least a few times with each shot. You will find the ' right ' angle eventually. No angle is set in stone, it all depends. Just take the pictures from a few different angles. Also experiment with the vertical or horizontal orientation of the shot.

pI5jKfmaaa	There are no fixed or universally agreed dates for the beginning or the end of the Ancient/Classical Greek period. In common usage it refers to all Greek history before the Roman Empire, but historians use the term more precisely. Some writers include the periods of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, while others argue that these civilizations were so different from later Greek cultures that they should be classed separately. Traditionally, the Ancient Greek period was taken to begin with the date of the first Olympic Games in 776 BC, but most historians now extend the term back to about 1000 BC. The traditional date for the end of the Ancient Greek period is the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. The following period is classed as Hellenistic. Not everyone treats the Ancient and Hellenic periods as distinct, however, and some writers treat the Ancient Greek civilization as a continuum running until the advent of Christianity in the third century AD.       Ancient Greece is considered by most historians to be the foundational culture of Western Civilization. Greek culture was a powerful influence in the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of Europe. Ancient Greek civilization has been immensely influential on the language, politics, educational systems, philosophy, art and architecture of the modern world, particularly during the Renaissance in Western Europe and again during various neo-Classical revivals in 18th and 19th century Europe and The Americas.    The basic unit of politics in Ancient Greece was the polis, sometimes translated as city-state. "Politics" literally means "the things of the polis." Each city was independent, at least in theory. Some cities might be subordinate to others (a colony traditionally deferred to its mother city), some might have had governments wholly dependent upon others (the Thirty Tyrants in Athens was imposed by Sparta following the Peloponnesian War), but the titularly supreme power in each city was located within that city. This meant that when Greece went to war (e.g., against the Persian Empire), it took the form of an alliance going to war. It also gave ample opportunity for wars within Greece between different cities.    Most of the Greek names known to modern readers flourished in this age. Among the poets, Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Sappho were active. Famous politicians include Themistocles, Pericles, Lysander, Epaminondas, Alcibiades, Philip II of Macedon, and his son Alexander the Great. Plato wrote, as did Aristotle, Heraclitus of Ephesus, Parmenides, Democritus, Herodotus, Thucydides and Xenophon. Almost all of the mathematical knowledge formalized in Euclid's Elements at the beginning of the Hellenistic period was developed in this era.       A Greek hoplite made up the majority of the soldiers in a state's army.Two major wars shaped the Ancient Greek world. The Persian Wars (500448 BC) are recounted in Herodotus's Histories. Ionian Greek cities revolted from the Persian Empire and were supported by some of the mainland cities, eventually led by Athens. (The notable battles of this war include Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis, and Plataea.)    In order to prosecute the war, and subsequently to defend Greece from further Persian attack, Athens founded the Delian League in 477 BC. Initially, each city in the League would contribute ships and soldiers to a common army, but in time Athens allowed (and then compelled) the smaller cities to contribute funds so that it could supply their quota of ships. Revolution from the League could be punished. Following military reversals against the Persians, the treasury was moved from Delos to Athens, further strengthening the latter's control over the League. The Delian League was eventually referred to pejoratively as the Athenian Empire.    In 458 BC, while the Persian Wars were still ongoing, war broke out between the Delian League and the Peloponnesian League, comprising Sparta and its allies. After some inconclusive fighting, the two sides signed a peace in 447 BC.    That peace, it was stipulated, was to last thirty years: instead it held only until 431 BC, with the onset of the Peloponnesian War. Our main sources concerning this war are Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War and Xenophon's Hellenica.    The war began over a dispute between Corcyra and Epidamnus; the latter was a minor enough city that Thucydides has to tell his reader where it is. Corinth intervened on the Epidamnian side. Fearful lest Corinth capture the Corcyran navy (second only to the Athenian in size), Athens intervened. It prevented Corinth from landing on Corcyra at the Battle of Sybota, laid siege to Potidaea, and forbade all commerce with Corinth's closely situated ally, Megara (the Megarian decree).       Herodotus (5th century BC), one of the earliest nameable historians whose work survives.There was disagreement among the Greeks as to which party violated the treaty between the Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues, as Athens was technically defending a new ally. The Corinthians begged Sparta for aid. Fearing the growing might of Athens, and witnessing Athens' willingness to use it against the Megarians (the embargo would have ruined them), Sparta declared the treaty to have been violated and the Peloponnesian War began in earnest.    The first stage of the war (known as the Archidamian War for the Spartan king, Archidamus II) lasted until 421 BC with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. The Athenian general Pericles recommended that his city fight a defensive war, avoiding battle against the superior land forces led by Sparta, and importing everything needful by maintaining its powerful navy: Athens would simply outlast Sparta, whose citizens feared to be out of their city for long lest the helots revolt. This strategy required that Athens endur|`|Fm5YsQnfaa	There is no evidence that they were educated anywhere else other than Greece.

How could Pythagoras have discovered the pythagorean theorem when the pyramids were mathmatically calculated and engineered so perfect?

Travellers like Herodotus (early 5th c BC - my mistake!) visited sub-saharan Africa as well as travelling extensively through Persia, but more in the spirit of adventure and collecting folklore than of learning from the people he met there.      Future Daddy - please provide references if you're going to make claims like that.  The Graeco-Roman pantheon is nothing whatever like the Egyptian one.

AA12343309	My answer is lengthy and I apologize but you need to understand the advantages and pitfalls of online genealogy and the different steps you should take even before you go online.    You do so by tracing your ancestry starting with yourself and working back one generation at a time. Don't get overly involved in your name. Your name is a very small part of you. If you get back to your 6xgreat grandparents, barring any duplicates, you come from 510 individuals. Of those 510, only 8 of them will have your name unless there was marriage to others with your name.    Get as much info from living family as possible.  Talk to your seniors. Tape them if they will let you. People who do this say they have gone back and listened to the tape again and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. They might be confused or wrong on some things.    Find out if any has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Also depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be very useful.    Websites that only have family trees are not totally worthless unless you are willing to verify the information with documentation.    The best website for original source records is not free but your public library might have a subscripton to it.  That is Ancestry.Com. They have all the U.S. censuses through 1930. The 1940 and later are not available to the public yet. They have immigration, military, land and other records. They have indexes to vital records of many states.    Not all records are online but the ones they have will save you money in traveling to courthouses, libraries, etc all over the country to get the records.    Good genealogy means good documentation.  Be very very careful about family trees on their website or ANY website, free or fee. They are subscriber submitted, seldom documented and when they are documented, they are usually poorly documented.    You frequently will see different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is accurate. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues as to where to get the documentation.    I recently found out that me, my sister and my brother-in-law were all dead. Didn't give dates of death but it said we died in New Jersey. The only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey was in 1956 when we drove through with our family coming back from New York. So be careful! You might be dead.    Checking further and I found family on both sides that married and died in Newton, Sussex County, New Jersey. Since what ancestry of mine that is not southern American colonial came in through southern ports, I was very surprised.  If this information had been sent to any of the websites, it would have been accepted. If you disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that is between you and the other subscriber.    A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon)Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.     I have never had them to try and convert me or send those handsome young missionaries by to ring my doorbell. I haven't heard of them doing that to anyone else that has used their resources.    Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.|`|oIgL3Y3saa	Yes, you can search, at geneaology.com, www.family search.com, rootsweb, even type in your surname family page ,then click on search, good luck, I'm still during research myself.
WWZEUMkzaa	Ask Hobbes and he'll tell you that man exists to submit himself to State. State is also above man in Machiavelli's ?Il Principe?. Rousseau is the counterpart; the State is product of a social contract, in which men quit some of their freedom in exchange of a State that will guarantee their rights.

sSdbfJpJaa	Philosophically, YES, of course hen or roosters are inferior quality of birds. I wonder, all the answerer mentioned 'chicken' that's cooked as dinner! Whereas the question is been asked about BIRD. I do agree with you that bird synonyms flying. People cries for birds , its species, its preservation etc----and poetic people highly prefer bird's flying; sometimes they protest for a caged bird, ahh! When the life began, people had dream of flying (like birds). In this regard, of course hens, roosters are of inferior qualities. I do honor chicken but I can't support hens or roosters as bird-like bird. Birds should have to fly high in the sky; they have to be free! Once I had a chance to go through a great poetry by Tagore, where there were dialogues between a caged bird & an wild bird-----and the wild bird won in the debate. How selfish we the human beings are that we even treat birds as inferior to hens or roosters, because we consume chickens most of the time! May be hens or roosters a superior quality of food item but these are inferior quality of real bird.|`|AA11564934	No, flying doesn;t define bird.    Do you think an ostrich is inferior?  It can kill a lion with a kick.|`|uiKAI8bWaa	Unless they where taking about his last meal in which case the old guy would consider a superior quality bird flightless & eatable.    They do seem inferior as a symbol of freedom though "a bird in freedoms walk" doesn't really cut it?|`|Cf8VzXVZaa	"whenever we hear the word BIRD, from a child to a dying old guy would then imagine some living creatures that knows flying!"      Who cares what we imagine? Birds are not defined by what we imagine, they are defined by science.    "Perhaps bird's synonym is Flying, agree?"   no.    "From this angle, isn't a rooster an inferior quality of bird?"  no.    It also depends on what you mean by flying. They can fly actually. Just not very far.|`|AA12226501	The birds you mention CAN fly...they just don't do so often or for long distances. They are not like the flightless birds...ostriches, emus, penguins. However, each serves its purpose.   Different strokes for different folks (or in this case different birds)...the hummingbird is the only one which can sustain backwards flight -does that make the hummingbird superior to all other birds?|`|EPe2p55Eaa	Hall of Flame  Turkey 4 Xmas and loved by everyone around the world.

A bird is a hen.  Which means that everything a bird is... a hen is. Also, a hen also has its own distinguishing characteristics such as its body shape. So in fact, a hen is a  genetically more superior organism than whatever organism all birds inherit from.    If you don't have a clue about what I'm saying than you need to get off this moronic site and get enrolled in a school.     If you do... aight... then we understand each other. ..............we both need to get off thise site and start reading a book.|`|HpWujntlaa	Is a man who can't walk an inferior quality of man?     Whether or not an animal flies or walks or swims, it is important part of life on this planet. No one thing on Earth is superior to anything else because all things are an essential component to our existence. You say that a chicken is inferior to other birds, but imagine if chickens were to suddenly disappear. Think of all the billions of people every day who eat all the billions of chickens in the world. Suddenly chickens become much more important right? We can't appreciate something based simply on one aspect of it's nature. All things living and not are significant somehow.|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	It all depends on how you cook it.      And you have never seen a hen or rooster fly?

AA12343309	American is a nationality only.  People with citizenship in the U.S. their nationality is American.  However their ancestral heritage is varied.  Even in colonial days, there were a variety of people, English, Scots, Scotch Irish (called Ulster Scot in Britain), Irish, German, French Huguenots, Dutch etc.  Then as the country expanded it took in areas that had people of other heritages. The people of southern Louisiana have mostly French heritage. They were already in New Orleans in the late 1600s.  Then some came down from Nova Scotia in Canada in the mid 1700s.  They were all there when the U.S. bought the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803.  In San Antonio, Texas it was originally ruled by Spain and Spain established a colony there in 1731 with families from the Canary Islands.  When Mexico broke from Spain, Texas became part of Mexico for 15 years.  Then Texas became an independent republic for 10 years. Texas entered  the U.S. as a result of a treaty between the U.S. and the Republic of Texas.    During the great wave of immigration starting in the mid to late 1800s and lasting through the first part of the 20th century, people came to the U.S. from all over Europe.  In the North, they tended to settle in their own little communities as they shared common values with each other.  I live in Southeast Texas. We have a large Cajun French population and always have had a sizable Italian population but we have never had Caucasian ethnic neighborhoods.  The African American  neighborhoods in the past weaved in and through the Caucasian Neighborhoods. The only Caucasian ethnic neighborhood I have ever seen in the South was when I lived in San Antonio and the neighborhood where I lived had been and was still to some extent a Jewish neighborhood.  There was an Orthodox synagogue close by and Orthodox Jews cannot use any means of transportation on the Sabbath.    There is one street in our town that before it was taken into the city limits mostly Italian truck farmers lived there.  The Italians here will tell you those truck farmers made good money back in the Great Depression going into neighborhoods and selling fresh vegetables off of their trucks.  Other than that  most of the Italians did not live in separate neighborhoods.    We also have some Syrians, Lebanese and Greek.  We have a Syrian Lebanese Orthodox Church here.  None of these people lived in separate neighborhoods.  The Jews here that live in Beaumont have never lived in separate neighborhoods.    Our prevailing language is English, but our ancestry is varied.      My father's was mostly Irish, but back in Ireland one of his ancestors married a woman who was mostly Italian, Spanish and Austrian.  My mother's mother was of southern colonial stock but she had English, Scot, Scotch Irish, Alsatian German and French Huguenot.   My maternal grandfather was Polish, Polish Jew, German and some American Indian.|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	Are you sure it didn't say NATIVE American? Which is also called American Indian. (As opposed to Asian Indian, from India. Those are two completely different races.)       And American is by no means synonymous with English. Sure, a lot of Americans have English ancestry, but certainly not all. I do not. I am Irish, and Scottish, and many other ethnicities, but not English.|`|nzdDdKtyaa	By american it could mean american native, but I don't think that's the case.    Even though modern america is made up of immigrants, we have developed our own distinct culture. So, you could label yourself as an american, without needing to go back to whether your ancestors were african, european, etc.    Also, "white" does not mean "english".  There are many nationalities of whites, just as there are many nationalities of blacks. Just as blacks might be Nigerian, South African, etc, whites could be English, Irish, German, Italian, any one or more of those. Just saying "white" is far too broad of a term, although I understand that many americans today cannot trace their lineage back to their country of origin.|`|TdE0J2xVaa	Here perhaps is your answer.  On the latest U.S. census, many citizens listed themselves as "American"  (7.2%). They are generally assumed to be of predominantly English, Irish, Scottish, or Welsh stock, though some are likely to be people of several other different European ethnicities who are unable or unwilling to choose one. Many people who trace their ancestry to the colonial period or the slavery era consider themselves to be of "American" ancestry
