20090305060715AAVS8aJ	Politics & Government;Elections	Will filing bankruptcy help or hurt GM?	 http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090305/ap_o...       Because I have family members who work/have worked for GM, and the industry in which I work indirectly relies on the automotive industry I was on the fence about them filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Not to mention the effect it would have on automotive suppliers who aren't even affiliated with GM.      Another reason for my concern is, per the article, people might be reluctant to buy from a company in chapter 11 for fear of warranty & replacement parts.       However, GM and the U.S. automakers in general have had ample Government assistance to help them get back on their feet to no avail.      So, to me, it sounds like a no win situation either way.      In your opinion, will filing bankruptcy help or hurt GM?

20090305120152AAt9Y09	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	CANADIANS: As her guardian what can I do about this situation?	So on a side note ~~~~ I had a girl!!!!! She's 17 and I'm sooo proud! HAHA      Anyways here's the background. I met Sarah during the summer of 2007. Bright, respectful girl I thought. She was planning to move to New Brunswick with her mother in a few days. Two days after meeting her she showed up on my doorstep bloody, bruised and hysterical. Her and her mom had been in another fight ~ her Mom hit her as she did regularly over something Sarah couldn't explain and didn't understand because as usual Sarah's Mom was incoherently drunk. (Since Sarah was 8 years old she cooked for herself because her Mom was always to drunk) Sarah was abused emotionally and physically for years. Once she left Sarah at age 12 for 3 months in their apartment while she went gallivanting with a man who didn't appreciate Sarah's presence. I could go on and on about how fuked in the head this girl's Mom is and was but I digress ~ she's a horrible woman. Now I'm done.      Soo Sarah's Mom took off to New Brunswick as scheduled and left Sarah here ~ to fend for herself at 16 years old ~ just turned. Since then I have seen this girl make decisions 30 year old women would have a hard time with. She's stubborn and determined and she uses what has happened to her to fuel her. She never uses it as an excuse. So since her Mom left Sarah has had it rough to say the least. My biggest battle has been keeping useless 20 something men away from her because in addition to being super mature for her age ~ she's beautiful.      MY POINT : Since her Mom took off on Sarah she has still been collecting baby bonus for her. The entire time. Sarah has barely spoke to her since she left but once she called her because she had no food, no tampons and was starting school the next day and had no money for bus tickets. Her mother did nothing, obviously. I can not stand the fact that she is collecting money for her and doing nothing to help her. As Sarah's guardian what can I do now to stop this? I want to make it clear I don't want the money ~ I want Sarah to have it and for her mother not to. The idea of her having to pay all back that she has collected since she took off on Sarah makes me smile too. Where do I start?

WEDNESDAY, Nov. 1 (HealthDay News) -- Anti-smoking ads on television produced by tobacco companies and aimed at parents may actually be encouraging children to start smoking, Australian researchers report.      "The tobacco companies are up to their old tricks," said Danny McGoldrick, director of research at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "Anyone who thinks that the tobacco companies have reformed are kidding themselves."      McGoldrick was not involved in the study, which was led by researchers at The Cancer Council Victoria in Melbourne.      They looked at television ratings data from 75 media markets in the United States. The team specifically looked at average exposure to tobacco company-sponsored anti-smoking ads, both those targeted to youths and others targeted to parents. Some of these ads featured titles such as "Think. Don't Smoke" and "Tobacco Is Whacko If You're a Teen."      The researchers also looked over data from a U.S. national school-based survey from more than 100,000 children from 1999 to 2002.      The report was published in the Oct. 31 online edition of the American Journal of Public Health.      The researchers found that, among young children, there weren't many links between exposure to tobacco company ads and smoking attitudes and behavior.      However, among high school students, seeing parent-targeted ads was associated with kids expressing a lowered sense of smoking as harmful, a stronger approval of smoking, stronger intentions to smoke in the future and a greater likelihood of having smoked in the past 30 days, the researchers found.

20090305123911AApIGN4	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Need a good and fair priced landlord/tenant lawyer in Washington DC.?	I am the tenant.  I am due my security deposit, which I would handle myself but I believe I may be due damages.  I would like to find a good lawyer that doesn't break the bank that could consult me.  This is a run down of what happened...      I vacated my previous rental unit on the 12th day of September, 2006. I provided my landlord with forwarding contact information.  He never returned the deposit to me or notified me of valid deduction from my deposit.   I also believe that he unlawfully evicted us, took criminal actions, discriminated against us and interfered with our right to fulfill the lease agreement in peace, all of which I have proof.   When my roommate and I realized we were going to be behind on the rent in June of 2006, I sent a partial payment with a note detailing why I was late and a payment schedule of when I would pay the missing monies, bringing my balance to paid in full by July 15, 2006.  Our landlord never contacted us stating that this was not acceptable to him.    Our first inclination that there was a problem was when we received an eviction notice on our door.  When we received the eviction notice we realized that he had made a claim for judgment in the incorrect amount.  He made a claim for $2520, stating that we owed him for a full two months rent plus an outrageous 10% in late fees, (there is no mention in our lease of charging anything for late fees).  He held onto the partial payments we had already sent him.  He did not send them back with a written letter stating that he was not accepting partial payment.  One of our payments he forged the date on the check and deposited it weeks after receipt.    My roommate and I went to court, (the landlord did not show).  On that date we discussed with his lawyer a missing payment we had made to him in the amount of $330.  His attorney stated that the landlord told him the check had been returned for insufficient funds.  We had no record of this and his attorney did not have the correct balance due so he advised us to hold our payment.  We ended up mailing the landlord the remaining payments including the two months of late fees.  We sent two letters expressing our desire to resolve this situation and other matters, he never responded to us and kept moving forward with eviction proceeding while holding on to our payments, never communicating with us or responding to our letters or calls.  After we received the notice from the US Marshall stating that we could be evicted at any time, we were left with no choice but to pay the stop payment fee and stop payment on our checks (except for the one in question of $330) and move out.  After we moved out he cashed the check for $330.   Additionally, he never repaired our air conditioning; we lived in sweltering heat all summer.  I woke up with termites hatching out of the walls and going onto my bed.  I made him aware immediately and he never exterminated.  He made derogatory comments towards my roommate as well as he NEVER referred to her by her correct name.  He made a miserable living experience for us and I hope that he does not continue to do this to other unsuspecting renters.    I have…   A. Copy of check with forged date   B. Copy of our lease for verification of handwriting    C. Copy of letter sent dated August 28, 2006   D. Receipt of letter (dated August 28, 2006) sent by certified mail   E.

Upon arrival officers contacted the owner of the business (victim) who said that he had just been robbed of cash and merchandise. According to the victim, three young men entered his business looking around for a few moments and left. Approximately 10 to 15 minutes later one of three men returned and selected a number of items. It appeared he was going to purchase the items, but he ultimately exposed a handgun he had in his waistband by lifting his shirt and the suspect demanded money and was given approximately $400 in cash. The suspect left the store on foot with the merchandise and the money. While officers were on scene investigating the crime, they were approached by the owner of  a donut shop. She informed officers that she too had been robbed by a lone young male suspect at 5:30 a.m. and had not yet reported the incident. According to the second victim, the suspect entered the store and ordered a dozen doughnuts. He then lifted his shirt and exposed a handgun he had in his waistband and demanded money. The suspect was last seen leaving on foot, eastbound on State St. with a dozen doughnuts and approximately $10 cash.             WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK??

I am using this credit card that charges different interest rates based on the type of purchases. However, when I am paying down my balance, the credit card company said the money can only apply towards the portion that has the least interest rate, I cannot dictate how my money should apply to. This means I am always going to stick with a chunk of my balance that has the highest interest rate, unless I paid everything off. Is this legal? Is this loan-sharking?

20070307064929AAfNWlR	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you think, when the Repubs were impeaching Clinton, that they realized it would come back to bite them?	Do you think they realized that, by cheapening the impeachment process, they would be teaching the false lesson to our citizenry that you can try to remove a President from office simply because you don't like him?      Look at all the people who are claiming that we have grounds to impeach Bush.  We don't.  But they think we do, because if a President can be impeached for lying about a bj, surely you can impeach him for continuing a war that 90% of the country opposes, right?      But these are the lessons learned through abuse of the impeachment process.  Clinton was impeached for 1 reason and 1 reason only: the Republicans at the time felt threatened by him.  So they began a lengthy, expensive, time-consuming hunt for something - ANYTHING - with which to bring him down.  And when they FINALLY managed to back him into a corner by subjecting the President of the United States to an embarrassing interrogation under oath about his sex life, he lied.  What did we prove?  That he's human.

Now comes the new millenium and nobody wants to see a muslim in office 'cause he's inherently a terrorist.

Also, that doesn't automatically mean that I hate ALL republicans either. I used to think John McCain was a good man, until he started sucking up to the religious right.

It began as a custody case. I moved from my mother's to my father's. All we needed was to get the child support payments altered. For some reason the judge on hand delayed our case 4 months past the legal limit. The judge now had broken the law. When we contacted the Attourney General, he refused to do anything. The lawyer we had hired sucked and did nothing. Now we need a good agressive lawyer, but it is difficult to find one online because i want to be assured he/she will be a good lawyer.   I ask you to please offer any suggestions you may have.   The lawyer needs to be in CT, preferably in the Hartford County area.   Thank you very much, all suggestions will be greatly appretiated.

20090226111232AAlgONo	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are Republicans urged to embrace Reaganism instead of trying to go forward with their own ideas?	Reagan gave us deficit-spending, neoconservatism, and massive defense spending (amongst other things).      Policies which still haunt us even to this day. (Like signing a bill in 1985 which allowed illegal immigrants entry to this country--for example. Today, we have too many illegal immigrants in this nation--with some estimates suggesting that we will have close to 192 million illegal immigrants by 2030--and some states' recent census figures show that some small towns and community neighborhoods are being overtaken by illegal immigrants. On top of that, state subsidary programs usually used by people in need are being pushed past their breaking points--because of so many illegal immigrants are applying for services that they don't have a legal right too.)      Nearly 30 years later--the GOP is still trying to march lockstep back towards those days--desperate to embrace *something* of what Reagan either was, or what his stance represented during the Cold War.      But given the fact that a lot has changed in 30 years--why hasn't the GOP?      What good is embracing the past when we now live in a much different future?      The Republican Party *needs* to stop destroying itself over obsolete values, ideas, or issues that have little or no impact with the multitude of voters *today*--rather than standing on a degenerate platform which only appeals to a certain segment of a culturally and socially-repressed voter-bloc.      If change is going to happen, it needs to be with the GOP--if they ever hope to have a shot at the 2012 ticket.      Because having Jindal as their next big candidate will just reduce this country into stitches when it come to the next big vote. :0)

By the time taxes are taken out of his income, it's not worth working 60-80 hours a week and designing multi million dollar projects for the community and state.       Now his plan is to work as little as possible and contribute nothing to the community. That way he will provide more security for his family by bunning money from the state. Kinda like what a leach does and he's dead serious about it.      It's so sad his amazing career is ending like this. He is by far my biggest role model in my life.

20070501153100AAjeHoK	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Seeking an Indiana attorney who has experience with expungements.?	I pled no contest to burglary 30 yrs ago (at age 19) and was placed on probation until 21.  I now have a graduate degree and hold a professional position.  There are no other criminal charges. My research indicates that  the only way to get a true expungement, as opposed to simply having records sealed, is to receive a recommendation from the Parole Board to receive a pardon from the governor.  Once a pardon is received, expungement is allowed.        This conviction has haunted me for the last three decades.     I'm a single woman who lives alone.  My home was burglarized about 1 1/2  years ago.  I cannot even purchase a firearm or get a gun permit for self-defense because of something that happened in 1977.  My work involves being around adult male felons - another reason I'd like protection in my home. I've checked the usual places for referrals (Bar Assocation, etc.).  I'm at a loss and would be grateful for the name of an Indiana attorney with experience in this area.

20070710081057AAt7gYW	Politics & Government;Politics	Why is economics such a mystery to some people?	 http://news.yahoo.com/s/csm/20070710/ts_...       This is a stupid story, a stupid concept - - people living in a neighborhood for 40 years, not taking care of it, and not investing in it, not buying but taking advantage of low rents, now that the property values are going up they're unable to take advantage of it - - - if they owned the property, rising values would be a good thing, they'd make out like bandits.      In life we make CHOICES.    You CHOOSE to sacrifice present cash flow for future net worth when you buy rather than rent - or you choose to sacrifice future net worth for present cash flow when you rent rather than buy.  If you choose the latter and property values go up, you're not a victim of anything but your own choice.      If you're free to choose, you're not free to blame others for the result of your choice.      Plus it's not like it's any surprise, please, they developed the West End, Southie, even the Leather District, nobody didn't know this was coming.

20081017194559AAKuLK1	Politics & Government;Politics	Why did Obama condemn Palin during debate for not stopping man for yelling, "Kill Obama?:?	Breaking from Newsmax.com   Secret Service: 'Kill' Obama Report Unfounded   Barack Obama asserted during Wednesday night's presidential debate that someone shouted "kill him" when the Democrat's name was mentioned at a Sarah Palin rally.   But the head Secret Service agent at Tuesday's Palin rally in Scranton, Pa., said: Never happened.    The Scranton Times-Tribune first reported the alleged incident on Tuesday in a story written by reporter David Singleton, saying that while congressional candidate Chris Hackett was addressing the crowd and mentioned Obama's name, a man in the audience shouted "kill him."    Other media outlets picked up the story, including ABC News, MSNBC, and The Associated Press, with most attributing it to the Times-Tribune.    During the debate Obama mentioned to John McCain "some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like 'terrorist' and 'kill him,' and that your running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say, 'Hold on a second, that's kind of out of line.'"    But Bill Slavoski, the agent in charge of the Secret Service field office in Scranton, was in the audience at the rally, along with an undisclosed number of other agents, and he said not one of them heard the comment.    "I was baffled," he told the Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Times Leader after reading the Times-Tribune report.    He said the Secret Service conducted an investigation and could not find a single person to corroborate Singleton's allegation.    "We have yet to find someone to back up the story," Slavoski said. "We had people all over and we have yet to find anyone who said they heard it."

Ho letto alcune risposte ad una domanda avanzata da Leninista a proposito della Seconda Guerra Mondiale. Volendo generalizzare vedo che c'è gente che difende ad oltranza l'interventismo americano. Tornando a quel periodo qualcuno ha parlato dei 70.000 morti  yankee in Normandia. Il numero non fa una grinza cari, secondo tutti i libri di strategia militare un tedesco valeva militarmente quanto 10 americani, se ne son morti tanti poveracci è colpa dei grandi numeri, se non ne buttavano alla carica tanti col cavolo l'avevano vinta con i tedeschi. Comunque credo che l'interventismo americano sia sempre dovuto ad un secondo fine. Lasciate perdere le stupidate che vogliano difendere la democrazia. Qualche giorno fa sul "Giornale" leggevo un articolo di M. Cervi (26 Aprile) e diceva la guerra ormai era decisa nella Mitteleuropa dove dilagavano le truppe sovietiche. Se ve lodice un vecchio volpone liberale come Cervi , abboccate e zitti please...

They have their man and are pleased to work hard for him.      Blue Dog Democrats (fiscally moderate to conservative) believe Obama's pie has dessert for everyone.     ?????      Traditional Democrats do not understand the terrible judgement and charactor traits of Obama. Ayers is not a strong enough link for them, Rev. Wright is only minimally effective, (Why is this guy so quiet? I cannot imagine him accepting the label as radical.) Fannie Mae, voting present, and a couple of other small things is all we have because of his very limited experience and exposure.      What will it take to push a few Obama supporter to the other side? I understand most of the polls are a tiny biased 2-5%, some have lied to poll takers about voting for a black man, and the ordinary numbers will tighten for McCain. I do not think that will be enough.      People should be lined up for miles to oppose this guy and his extreme left, it just will not happen this time. McCain has to sway more moderates.

20090109192235AAZ4yC5	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Should uk judges be prosecuted when they commit miscarriages of justice ? ?	Do you think that they should be more responsible for their actions.   After all they say nobody is above the law.   if a man is wrongfully convicted and imprisoned for some times more than 10 years as they have in the U.K how come no one has to answer for it.   If i was to wrongfully imprison a person i would go to jail.   WHY is it that it's ok just to pay the poor person compensation out of tax payers money and not be answerable for the neglect he has committed in his court.   He is ultimately responsible for false imprisonment surely.   Why are they allowed to just not be answerable for their illegal actions.   They are above the law lets face it !   from police right up to prossecution services and the judges.   they can break the law and be immune from responsibility and prosecution.     It's wrong for no one to take responsibility when a man loses his freedom for something he has not done.   When a judge allows a miscarriage of justice in his court then surely he has to be dismissed at least.   eye for an eye i say. if a judge sends a man to prison wrongfully then that judge should also go to jail for the same term that he sentenced the innocent man too.   This would be fair justice surely and i am sure it would wake them all up a bit and stop this neglect of duty.

Teach and urge these duties."              "Whoever teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness, is conceited, understanding nothing, and has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words.

I don't get it...all the way up to the 1960's, Russian / Soviet military uniform hats were smart, trim, and frankly extremely good looking.  Then all of a sudden, they got really weird looking, almost Zoot-suitish (See  http://www.undertheredstar.com/kgb.htm  for a good example of the progression).      Is there a specific reason for this, other than style? I mean, someone in the Kremlin clearly decided that dressing up the Soviet military like the Flying Nun was a good idea, I'm guessing there was some sort of cultural or identification reason for it (maybe they just wanted to look totally different from Stalin era uniforms?). Does anybody know the specific reasons? Thanks!
