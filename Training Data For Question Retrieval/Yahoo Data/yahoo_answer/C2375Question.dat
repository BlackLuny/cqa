20090226131302AARyY3k	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	What grade is my frankenstein coursework?	i'm doin my frankenstein coursework at school and was wondering what grade it is   i would prefer a teacher to have a look at it but anyone can tell wether thay think it any good or not      Look at the significance of chapter five to    the novel as a whole. Focus on the relevance and    effect of writer’s use of language to describe    setting, character and what it shows   about social and historical influences.         Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus was written in the early 1800’s, a time when there were new discoveries being conceived almost daily and people were pushing the boundaries of what was seen to be morally ethical. Frankenstein is a story about a young and na?ve scientist who pushes these boundaries beyond the limit by playing God and creating life.    The story begins with Captain Robert Walton writing letters to his sister about his voyage to discover a passage through the north pole. Shelley uses the letters to create a sense of realism in the story because to the audience it may seem there is a possibility that Shelley found the letters and was retelling a true story. The most obvious ‘deeper’ meaning to the novel is a warning to scientists to not become obsessed with their investigations and if they do discover something potentially dangerous they should take responsibility for it. This is shown when Victor is talking about Captain Walton’s voyage and says that he has ‘drunk also from the intoxicating cup’ when he realises that Walton has become obsessed.   In chapter 5 we see the creation of the monster and this is when Frankenstein becomes fearful of his creation and attempts to abandon it forever. The chapter starts by setting the scene as a ‘dreary night on November,’ here Shelley is using prophetic fallacy to foreshadow something terrible happening. When Frankenstein brings the body that he had designed as beautiful to life he see’s that it not as he had hoped, it had become a ‘catastrophe’. Traumatized by this ‘catastrophe’, Frankenstein attempts to hide from the monster and by the next morning the monster has disappeared. Here, Frankenstein has shown no responsibility for the life he has created and it is the first sign of hatred towards the monster which is the first link in the chain that makes the monster evil.   When Frankenstein abandons his creation it shows that he did not follow in his parents footsteps of taking responsibility for the ‘innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them’. When Frankenstein was being raised, his parents responsibility was ‘to direct him to happiness or misery’. This shows that because Frankenstein was being looked after he had a happy childhood and implies that if he was not looked after he would be directed to misery. Therefore, without care and direction towards the very childlike monster, it would become miserable and be more inclined to do evil things.   When the monster is brought to life Shelley uses lots of imagery to create a vivid picture of a hideous ‘wretch’, she writes that the skin of the monster ‘scarcely covers the work of the muscles and arteries’ and that the ‘lustrous black’ hair and that the ‘teeth of a pearly whiteness’ create a ‘horrid contrast’. This creates an inhuman image in the mind of the reader. Shelley uses this horrid image to create a prejudice in the mind of the reader which assumes the monster is going to be evil. When Frankenstein retires to his room and has nightmares about the monster, Shelley describes the noises it makes as ‘inarticulate’, this description is used to make the monster seem childlike and which will give the impression that it needs to be looked after, Frankenstein, as its creator, is the person who is responsible for this.   This chapter links to the theme of, don’t become obsessed, because at the end of the chapter the obsession that Frankenstein had been concentrating on causes him to almost die and he is extremely ill for a long time. Where it not for the miraculous appearance of his friend, Henry Clerval, who he had been neglecting due to the obsession, he would have died.    The novel would have an impact on the audience because during the 1800’s almost everyone was extremely religious and it was the main reason for the way people lived their lives. The majority of people believed that the scientists were trying to replace God, because of the sense of realism Shelley has created throughout the story it would shave made people believe that it were possible to bring back the dead. This would have outraged anyone who was religious because it would mean that the scientists would completed their quest of taking over the role of God. This also ties in with the subtitle of the novel, the modern Prometheus; because the scientists would have made the story of creating man a reality.    Reading Frankenstein will give the reader a good understanding of what is considered appropriate language and writing style for 19th Century prose. The complex sentences along with vocabulary give the reader a better unde

I like maths, and my school offers further maths, but that one is all about statistics and stuff, which is a side of maths I really DO NOT find interesting at all. My mum somehow got the idea I was taking it anyway, and I thought she knew I wasn't so I adressed the subject really casually and now it turns out she wants me to do it anyway, saying the parental rubbish of "sometimes you've got to force yourself to achieve your ultimate goal", "you've got to take this GCSE, because it's worth more" and "it will look good on your CV"... She even started insulting the subjects I do want to take! To tell you the truth, I'm sick of doing subjects I don't like, and now I finally get to ditch them, but my mum refuses to understand that I REALLY don't want to take it and that a tiny GCSE more or less won't matter. Also, because I'm fluent in French and German, I'm taking those GCSE's this year and possibly the A-Levels next year, which means that I'll have 2 more GCSE's than everybody else anyway! But she's being stubborn about this, so please help me!

I have been told all along by his doctor he was just a little behind and he would catch up. He will be 5 in June and after 3 years of trying is still not potty trained. His doctor said he would "catch up". I dont know how he will be able to be in kindergarten. I checked from the school to see about pre-kindergarten and was told at $50,000 a year for our family of 5 we made to much.

20090226095322AACug2l	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	I failed one of my classes this past semester, will I lose my scholarship?	I'm a senior in high school and I got a Trustee Scholarship for college. The requirement to keep the scholarship is that as long as my "grades in the final secondary school report are satisfactory" it will not be revoked. It states nothing about my GPA.    This past semester I failed English, but kept A's (and one B) in all other classes. The reason why I failed this class was because I was away on vacation for the first week of the semester and my teacher did not mention several assignments I had missed when I asked her (she's old... I'm imagining she forgot). As a result, those assignments were recorded as "incomplete" and brought my grade down significantly.    Now I'm worried about losing my scholarship because of this one class. In two previous semesters, my grades in English were A's.

Right now I'm only a sophomore in high school but I already know I want to major in english and film in college. The problem is, I don't know how hard it is to get a decent job right after I graduate from college. I don't want to do what my sister did, she majored in history and is basically wasting her degree on a job that does not pay well. If I went ahead and majored in english and film, what are my chances of getting a decent job related to film? I'm thinking of eventually being a scriptwriter or director but I know that it will probably take a while to become either.      Also, how hard would it be to get into a good film school? I currently have a 4.0 GPA but I know getting into good schools can be pretty competitive.

When he had finished wrapping my ankle, I slid off the table but he had to help balance me. He caught me, but he had put one of his hands on my boob. I blushed and he smiled and told me how pretty I was. He kept his hand there and asked me if I had a boyfriend. I told him no, and he started to slide his hand up under my shirt. He started to kiss me, and at first I really liked it because I thought he was so cute. Then he pushed my bra up and started to play with me. I started to cry and told him no, and he stopped. He told me he thought I had wanted to do it with him. He said we could do more, that he could teach me how to do things boys would like and that it would be our secret. I’m 16, and he’s only like 32. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to get him in trouble, because I do think he's cute, and I did kind of like it. I’m embarrassed to tell my parents or friends. What should I do?

Hi i'm currently doing my As levels in spanish,maths,biology and chemistry and i'm looking at uni courses. I like the sound of linguistics and spanish but i'm worried having not done english in a while it may not be a wise choice to pick. ( I got B in english language and A* in english literature at Gcse level by the way). So obviously english language isn't my strong point really which put me off taking english literature at As level because there was a lot of english language involved. I do actually miss doing english literature though and reading the novels and poems, and combining that with spanish,which is my favourite subject, would be great. However, I'm worried I may have trouble with this course. Unis say you need a grade C in gcse english language though.   Thanks

20090226144218AAu8pFi	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Am I ready for AP French?	I'll be a junior next year, and considering AP French. I'm already taking AP Biology.   Should I do it? I guess I'm "decent" in French... but I don't really think I'm that good. However, my grades are telling me that I'm honestly not too bad at French. I'm in French 5H and have a B+ and got an A- on the midterm. Last year in French 4H, I got an A average.   I feel like I'm not ready and that I know the bare minimum for French. Like I STILL get confused with imperfect tense and past tense, and we're just learning conditional. But it seems that I'm doing okay in French 5H?   Honestly though, my teacher cannot teach. At least, that's how I feel.      So am I ready for AP French? I don't really know...I feel like I'm not too good with French, esp grammar, but my grade in French the past few years tell me I'm decent.    Again, I can always learn or reinforce French grammar over the summer, just as a precaution.
20090226142207AA5YTwo	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	I really want to get ahead (in school) this summer, what should I do?	I'm going into the IB program this year (kind of like AP, but different) and I really want to get ahead. I'm used to just reading in class, or just paying half the attention I should be and knowing 98% of the stuff being taught in class, but I know that next year, in IB, it will be harder and more challenging and a lot different, so I really want to get ahead. The subject in school I struggle the most in is math, and it doesn't help that I hate my teacher, and that I have math first period EVERY DAY and I'm really tired and my brain hasn't adjusted to "School" mode yet. Also, last year, I had an incredibly crappy teacher who never gave us notes/NEVER taught anything, and all we did in her class was 4-question long quizzes, and then we spent the rest of the period correcting them. Pathetic, I know.   Ok, back to my question :P   How can I get ahead? I've already talked to my parents about getting a tutor for math, and they are all for it. As for the other subjects, I don't really want to go to summer school (because it's just repetition of everything I've already covered), and at my school, you need to be getting below 70%, and you have to be returning the next year (My average is 84%, and I'm going to a different school next year, because of IB).   So yeah, what should I do? Read the English books we'll be reading??   BTW, I'm taking English, French, Spanish, Science, Geography, Math, and Gym (Yes, I need pointers on how to get fit/better at sports for that). I'm also taking Visual Arts, but I'm pretty good at that, :)   THANKS!

Next year i am planning on playing volleyball and being in more clubs. I will have 6 APs or more by the time i graduate. I am truly a well rounded person and a lot of self motivation. I want to go to Vanderbilt or Duke! But i don't know if i am good enough. I want to major in psychology or become a doctor. Which one do you think would let me be financially stable? and please don't say not to worry because i am a freshman.

The source is newspaper!       http://features.csmonitor.com/backstory/...       The writing is this:      The author, a journalist at The Christian Science Monitor, writes about sex roles through the fact that Eri Yoshida became the first female drafted in Japan’s all-male professional league. The author first informs that discrimination in gender used to be a lot worse.  For example, girls weren’t allowed to join little leagues 20 years ago, and in sumo wrestling, they still can’t be inside of sumo ring. The article concludes that in a lot of cases, though many opportunities in sports are still male dominant, the first Japanese female pitcher would definitely change the future. In contrast, an Interview on Yuka Yamamoto shows that in last five years, there have been enough opportunities for girls to play baseball, and this is not fair for girls to play baseball with boys.

20090226153229AAxBY2f	Education & Reference;Homework Help	URGENT! Please help with my english homework, i have to write a short story but don't know where to go with it?	This is what so have so far... and don't worry it's not as long as you think, you can skip to the end if you want.   "Smile.” My aunt Judith held the camera to her face and I leaned towards my Grandfather. He held his arm around me and I plastered a smile onto my face. We stayed frozen like that while my aunt fumbled with the camera. I kept that grin there the whole time and finally the camera flashed and I was released. My mouth ached from smiling and I rubbed my cheeks sureptitously.     “Oh, Merideth,” I grimaced, only Judith called me that and I hated it. To get her back I called her Judith when she wasn’t around even though she had all her nieces call her Aunty Jude. Blech, she was so full of herself and she tended to over state things and her sentences where so wordy. “I LOVE that necklace. WHERE did you get it? Really I MUST know.” See what I mean? She also had a tendency to talk loudly which made it hard to say anything and be heard.    “Thanks. I love it to, it’s my favorite.” The necklace I was wearing at the time was a simple leather cord with a painted tiger face hanging off it. I loved it because I felt it was simple yet elegant, like me. I don’t know if that sounds snotty or not, I’ve never shared that thought with anyone.    Just then the waiter walked up and said in that falsely polite voice that all waiters have to use.    “May I interest anyone in dessert?” Really, I feel bad for those poor people. No matter how annoying the customer is they have to smile and nod and do whatever the person asks. I wouldn’t be able to stand that. It’s hard enough for me to resist telling Judith what I think of her. I’m very independent and I always say what I think. If I set my mind on something you can bet I’m gonna get it done.   “None for me thank you very much. I’m QUITE full up with your EXQUISITE food.” Judith’s loud voice was first to answer of course and I rolled my eyes. I opened my mouth to ask for the chocolate cheese cake but my mother shook her head and said quickly, ”I believe we’re all ready for the bill.” The waiter nodded, smiled and headed towards the kitchen. I know times have been hard lately but I thought that my last night at home before I head off to a college half way across the country would allow for a little more freedom.       This is just a rough draft and i know the writing isn't perfect. It is supposed to be a short story and i don't know where to go with it. I have to have some kind of conflict, what i want is for her to have to deal with someone who she doesn't like, It was gonna be Judith or i could add a cousin or something. The main issue is how do i get it to move quickly to the start of the conflict and what is the conflict about? Could you help? thanx.

Supposedly we are a part of the Great Trail Council in Ohio - but the representative will not call us back.  Is there a main number?      Also, we have visited one troop, with plans to visit two more troops.  One of the adult leaders told me something that alarmed me:  That they (the adult leaders in this troop)  cannot get the names of the merit badge counselors for the boys.  My son really is not interested in camping - yet anyway - my son is really interested in working on the merit badges though.  How can we get the names of the merit badge counselors for this troop?  Is there a contact that can be called? phone number?      Thanks!!!

20090225113900AAAqbXC	Education & Reference;Teaching	What do you think can make math a more interesting subject for students?	Many students find math to be boring. When I teach math, I always start from the ground up. I don't like to give out a definition or theorem without deriving it, because students think that this is somehow magic. So, when I teach I will actually "tear apart" the theorem and discuss what it really means (many textbooks like to throw out theorems and definitions without discussing them in detail). Then I will back it up with a few examples.       So, my question is what do you think can make math a more interesting subject ?  Please be specific and give examples.       I would like to hear from both students and teachers.

Im not physically imposing- just about average height, skinny build- im a good runner and in decent shape. I don't really say much but sometimes when I do talk it is absolute crap that comes out.

Also I know about everyones weak points in their mind but don't exploit them? What can I say or do besides snitching

20090226151818AAVBdmX	Education & Reference;Homework Help	I'm writing for my English class. Tell me what you think.?	Subject; Call and Effects of WWII.       “Heil Hitler!”    The Poles had no idea it was coming. All they could hear was this strange language being shouted by tall men, wearing sturdy black boots, helmets, and carrying Karabiner 98k’s. These men were marching through the streets. The people, who were meandering about the city, scurried to find confinement in homes and businesses. They could hear the shouting continue.    “Los! Los!”    These terrifying men broke in to the buildings. They urged the Poles to come to them.    “Kommit schnell! Schnell!”    It was September first, 1939 in Poland when the Nazis invaded. World War Two had begun. What many people come to think was the beginning of the end, had arrived.        For you people who are not World War Two history buffs such as myself, I shall brief you on the events of the war in concise detail. In 1939, a dictator by the name of Adolf Hitler was in power. He ordered the Nazis to invade Poland. He kidnapped many people including Polish Jews, gypsies, gays, political leaders. (The list could go on and on) Then in 1940 the Nazis invaded the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxemburg. He took more men, women and children captive. In 1941, our oh-so-famous Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese. Over the next three years Adolf Hitler took control of the majority of Europe and sent numerous amounts of people into concentration camps. The Jews, homosexuals, and people of political importance were sent to these terrifying camps. Finally, in 1945 the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan. One was let loose in Nagasaki and the other in Hiroshima, thus drawing an end to WWII.       The most influencing affect is the prejudice that has come from the war. Adolf Hitler, a key part of WWII, was a racist, sexist, brutal man. But, in his mind he thought what he was doing, was for the good of the people. The difference of thought he had, ruined many a lives in the early forties and continued to change some later on. He had thought the Jewish, the homosexuals, gypsies and many more people were in the wrong because they were not the blue-eyed, blonde, light-skinned people he had admired. These people were his idea of the perfect individual. From then on, numerous amounts of people have faced prejudice coming from the precedents he set. People have been called “Nazis” and been accused of following in Hitler’s footsteps because of the way they look. (Blonde and blue-eyed) The gays face prejudice every day as well. There are many news stories that have featured suicides by teens and adults in the gay community, because of the overbearing discrimination.        As well as the bigotry, you also need to account for the positive aspects of the war. The first includes the political changes that occurred. After World War 2, many countries’ economies became weaker because of the lack of influence Western Europe provided. Previously, Western Europe had shaped much of the way the world ran. After World War 2, though, when these nations were exhausted economically, militarily, etc… they began to be shaped. The result was a bipolar equilibrium. Two main forces, the United States and the Soviet Union became the most powerful nations. It still remains this way today.       Another positive influence includes the military and social changes that occurred. New technologies have been developed. Improved tanks and airplanes, and even the atomic bombs were created to make wars faster and more impacting. When it comes to the social aspects, women in France and Italy were allowed to vote. That’s an improvement, right? (The voting rights would be in the category of “social changes” not “military changes”)        World War II has had a great deal of affects on the world. There are many, many different things that have changed or begun because of this war. (I could take hours to explain all of them in precise detail, but I do not have the time.) Some are currently a degrading factor in our society such as the prejudice that many people encounter. However, most of the results have changed our way of life in an excellent way. These include the new technologies, products, and social advances which developed. All of the positive and/or negative factors are going to have to be dealt with throughout our lives, and in future lives. We cannot escape it now, nor will we ever.

20090226080551AALXIQN	Education & Reference;Homework Help	I have to write a 1400-1600 word research paper, help with topics?	Okay I have to write a 1400-1600 word research paper. I'd like an easy topic, but something that I would be able to right about 1500 words. I'd like to write all day today and tomorrow so that it can be done.      Here are a few topics I came up with, but I'd like to know your opinions, which sounds best, and any other ideas?       -Should prostitution be legalized? Under what conditions?      -Because celebrities are so often in the public spotlight, do they have ethical responsibilities to set good examples for young people?      -Should the legal requirements for obtaining a search warrant be changed?       -If an officer finds something that he was not looking for (e.g., narcotics in an automobile that was being searched for firearms), why should or shouldn't the officer have the right to take the accused into custody? Consider the issue of "reasonable suspicion" in your discussion.      -Should people under eighteen years of age be required to have parental permission to get tattoos and piercings?      -I might research a disease… but what kind???      Thanks for reading and thanks for the help!

She makes fun of me and says very mean and rude thing about me to me face and when i was just standing there she pushes me out of the way. She hangs out with my best friends and when i am with them she is always there. The other day she asked me to see my scarp that i had on and i said sure to be nice the she started pulling it very tight around my neck like she was trying to strangle me. i went home crying and i don't know what to do. My friends have told her to stop and says that's not very nice to say but she doesn't care. I am told that i am very blunt. Another time was when my friend came up to me and then she went somewhere for a minute and this girl who is very rude says go run no one like you. Which really hurt my feelings. and then i said i don't have to if i don't want to and then everyone is like laughing at me saying nice come back which i wasn't trying to do i was just trying to tell her off. but it for sure didn't work. The only reason she is so mean to me is because when she was younger and still now she was bullied so now she is bullying me. Please help me i need it.
