20080530053418AAzkJ0V	Environment;Conservation	Comment faire face à l'attaque imminente de diabétqiues enragés?	Conseillère au maire de Meaux, en charge de l'urbanisation, je dois vous faire part de faits inquiétants.   Depuis deux jours, nous recevons à la mairie appels et courriers de menaces d'une obscure confrérie se proclamant fan de Thierry Hazard.      Réclamant plus de places dans les rayons pour les produits sans sucres et l'ouverture d'un Jardiland, ils menacent de bloquer l'usine Bedouin say, et de remplacer la musique d'attente de notre standard téléphonique par "Pour aller danser le Jerk"      Le personnel est sur le qui vive. S'il venait à assiéger la mairie, leur deverser des marmittes de Sirop dessus du haut du toit serait-il efficace?      Doit-on engager des hommes de main qui placeront du sucre dans leur réservoir, ce qui aura pour effet d'en éliminer quelques uns quand leur voiture ne démarrant pas il siffonneront le carburant pour voir ce qu'il s'y passe?      Faites vite. Aidez nous à nous défaire de ses arriérés pro-LO!

20090205010943AABbKz7	Environment;Global Warming	What are some simple steps or creative ideas that people can take at home and work to combat global warming?	Global warming is not only one of the most threatening environmental problems, but one of the greatest challenges facing all of humanity. Danger signs are surfacing worldwide as temperatures increase (the last ten years have been the hottest years ever recorded causing glaciers and the polar ice caps to melt, coastal areas to flood and storms to become more severe). If left unchecked, global warming will continue to have a profound impact on our planet that will eventually cause catastrophic results. Fortunately, there are things each of us can do. Buildings -- including our homes -- are major contributors to greenhouse gases they’re responsible for up to 40% of all energy and resource use and approximately 1/3 of greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.

20090205025440AAr3zg7	Environment;Global Warming	Is there anyone that still believes that climate change is not man made?	Or still doubt that climate change is happening at all.      My personal beliefs :-   There is a powerful lobby, backed by the oil, automobile and other vested inerest industries, that still puts out information to the contrary, even though EVERY scientific study to date confirms global warming. This has now been proved beyond any doubt, and that this change is directly related to industrial and human output of CO2 into the atmosphere.   I await with interest the arrival of the next El Ninjo and its worldwide repercussions.   Being a Sailor (32,000 sea miles experience) and a scuba-diver, I've personally witnessed huge changes in weather patterns, so rapid as to be shocking. In every place I've visited, locals say the same thing, they can no longer predict what happens with the weather as they did before. Also, so many coral reefs killed off by warmer sea temperatures.    The Ice caps and glaciers melting at an alarming rate.   The "tundra" de-frosting, and this freeing the trapped methane, which is many times more dangerous than CO2.   I see my girlfriends young grandson and wonder how his offsprings life will be. It is our inability to change our consumer and energy consumption habits, which in the end is denying our own offspring the same chances as we ourselves have. We are multiplying the costs to future generations by delaying action now.   I also like coral Islands like those in the Bahamas, and the Maldieves.   I'm not happy that perhaps a billion people may be forced from coastal areas, just because so many people won't give up their polluting ways now.
