5wn8Lksdaa	Don't use the cue outside yet. You have to work up to it slowly. If she's perfect in the house, try the backyard next. When she has a handle on that, move to the front yard. Then maybe the sidewalk in front of your house. Once she is getting it, you can try doing it when you are crossing streets.|`|HqpDo9BYaa	Just keep working with her.  She's a pup; she's going to be distracted by other dogs and people.  Think of her as a child.  Kids don't have long attention spans when they're young (I know my 11 month old doesn't!).<br>  <br>  Try recruiting a few friends to just stand around and chat while you work on on-lead recalls.  Do it in an indoor setting first, then outdoors.  Then work on off-lead recalls indoors with people around.  Don't work on them outdoors until she consistantly comes to you.  Just be prepared for her to be distracted.  Good luck!|`|9UplT75saa	small steps... your moving to fast from in the house to the busy unknown world.  Next step should be the yard or just in front of the house.  she's still a puppy.  depending on type she will catch on by 6 months with some small steps and never punish when angry because she's not doing it right... key is positive reinforcement.  dogs have the attention span of a 4 year old for a very long time so it may take some time.  be consistent too
X0TjUZLFaa	well idunno what every says but i have convicts in 1 of my ten gallons with lots of baby's the male will just eat them to thin out the heard but before that happens just take the baby's out and put them in a different tank i've had mine in there for 2 years and its great to watch them lay there eggs so the baby's can eat them :D|`|O0gnVpz1aa	You could try some dwarf gouramis, spike tail paradise fish or some dwarf cichlids like Rams.

Ik6WOcw3aa	He is a catfish. Looks to be from the pangassius family. Most likely an irridescent shark.    There are no freshwater sharks. Any fish that has shark in the name and lives in freshwater is either a catfish, or from the cyprinid family.    Young picture.  http://www.thechildrensmuseumct.org/irid...    Larger picture.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Irides...    There arent really any care sites about them. Because they are so massive that its not a good idea to keep them.    But, they grow to 36 inches. The largest one also weighed 96 pounds. They are a schooling fish. They require alot of swimming room. So basically, you will need tankspace to have several 36 inch long fish swimming around constantly.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	It's a pangassius catfish or one of its close relatives.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	it looks like a dwarf hammer head mixed w/ some type of algae eater or a dwarf cat fish|`|YWlSB3esaa	id shark that grows to 4 feet, long they are true sharks actually wit that huge size they can grow i hope u care more about the tank size rather than his whiskers|`|QV6swGUMaa	looks like a cat fish but not to sure try this site this is the closest i could findhttp://www.thetropicaltank.co.uk/Fishind...|`|uWpwXn6paa	It is a small blue whale--we have one we call egghead.

Mine has no interest in eating any of his mates.|`|bJh1MesQaa	He looks like some sort of shark. Maybe a dwarf hammerhead.|`|3zEKZNFsaa	With the whiskers hanging off his mouth he looks to be a freshwater catfish.  The ones they sell around here that eat the algae off the tank bottom and such.

Would look at your local pet store or pet smart if you have one and look at the different fish they have to offer and ask to see the cat fish so that it is verified that is what it is.|`|mFQydvncaa	take a pic and go to a pet store that specializes in fish to be sure and get him a companion! its going to be hard to get one without a real answer, because a lot of fish sadly arnt compatible! goodluck|`|c77qsgdvaa	definitely catfish family, try looking here ...http://www.planetcatfish.com/|`|soqGxITGaa	I think it is call a Bali Shark|`|IdpVYdEWaa	He may be a clown catfish, although I cant be completely sure from this picture..  Approximately how big is he?|`|PTsIhyHgaa	Dark Royk is correct, that is an iridescent shark. They are NOT good fish to keep as they get HUGE- you need an aquarium the likes you find at sea world to keep IDs.

hbj6vGE4aa	Not a stupid question at all!  It is good to start training young.    Ok, it sounds like you are holding the treat too high.  Hold it closer to his nose, and it is ok if he tries to nibble and get at it.  You can put your hand behind his hocks (back feet) to discourage backing up.  As a matter of fact, let him nibble, then gently and slowly move the treat back over his head.  As SOON as that little butt hits the ground, dispense the treat!  Remember, he is just a pup, you want to mold the behavior, don't make him sit for a long time at first.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za5IO00OA...    here is a pretty ok video from youtube.  I didn't really find any *good* ones.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Push her backside down, say "Sit!" and when she stays like that, give her the treat and shower her with praise. Don't let her jump up and take it out of your hand (perhaps conceal it in your fingers so she can smell it but not get hold if it). Just keep persevering. It takes time but she'll get it in the end. Good luck! :)|`|wCcioHqVaa	Have a treat on hand and push her butt down say sit and give her the treat and praise her do this lots of times|`|2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa	You really don't have to teach the dog to sit.  It already knows how to do that.  What you have to train it to do is to associate the command with the act of sitting.    With both puppies I have owned, I did not use treats as a reward.  Simple praise is good enough, as the the dog wants to please its owner.  In my opinion, using food at this early stage confuses the dog  Eating is a hard-wired survival response to hunger, and while an animal will learn when to eat and when to not, this is too young.    Keep working with the dog by first, seeing that it is calm to begin with.  Trying to train an animal that is all worked up because you've been playing with it is a waste of your time and the animal's.      When it is calm, if it is standing (if not, get it to a standing position), gently push down on its hindquarters with one hand while holding your other hand above its head to direct attention toward your face, and give the command to sit.  Keep repeating this.  Be sure to give it plenty of praise and gentle touching each time it responds correctly to the command. It will catch on fairly quickly.|`|HYpEOdsraa	Your puppy is a little young to start any intensive training yet.  Their concentration span is probably nil at the moment.  Give it a little time to settle in and when it is between 10 weeks and 3 months old the puppy will 'sit' for you if you hold a treat above its nose.  There is no need to press on the pup's hindquarters, this can cause damage to their spine at this young age.  The action of you holding the treat above its nose coupled with the word 'sit' should be sufficient.    Good luck with your puppy.|`|AA11947327	Here's a good site that will show you how to teach lots of things.  http://www.loveyourdog.com/tricks2.html|`|Ky4QX9jJaa	I would just keep doing that with the treat and eventually your dog should figure it out.  Put the treat in front of and above it and then move it back over it's head.  The dog's head should follow the treat and its bum will automatically plop down.  That's how I taught my dog to sit.  It might take a little longer since your dog is so young, though.  Depending on their age and development some dogs take a little longer to learn things, like mine, she's about a year and is finally learning the concept of dropping her ball when she brings it to me.    If the treat thing still isn't working you could try to kind of put your arm in the crease of his/her back legs to kind of force a sit.  Don't be too forceful, and never push down on the hips of a puppy that isn't fully grown because that could hurt them.  And remember to always say "sit" when your dog does it so the word will become associated with the action.  Good luck!
XF1ctbrkaa	just plain tanks, or the whole set up?..  I know the empty tanks at petsmart are about $25 to $30 ..  Set ups depend on what kind, but most are around $50 yo $100..  These are not that expensive..     You can watch craigslist , but most of them will not be new... you can get good prices though.. if I had any idea where you were I could look on there , but while I know there are at least 6 different tank set ups near me,  that won't help if you are not around here..|`|OsVswissaa	do you have kijjiji.com there?  that's popular here.|`|hiJaXOD5aa	Try garage sales.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Petsmart, Petco, and Walmart. They all sell 20 gallon kits for about 70-80 bucks.    The online sites dont have the kits on their. They just have bioorbs and other expensive setups.    But dont expect to be able to set a new 20 gallon up for less than 120-150 dollars. ANd if you need a stand also, dont be surprised if you spend 200 bucks.
YpEswTQdaa	Probably.    Female Rabbits(Does) are capable of mating ALL year round,after 4 months of age. Although a Dwarf Doe should be at least 5 months old,before mating for the first time. A Buck(Male) can mate any time after 4 months old,however he should ideally be 5+ months old.    Are they over 4 months old? If so i am positive that she is pregnant. Even the a single mating can be successful,in Rabbits. When actually purposely breeding Rabbits,the owner will generally only leave the pair together for no more than a day. When she is 12-14 days into her pregnancy(write it down,when they were 1st put together,so you don't forget) when she is palpated,you should be able to feel marble sized lumps,inside her belly. Also her belly may be tenser. A Rabbit is pregnant for 29-34 days,the average being 31 days. When she is 1 week,to 2 hours away from birth,she should pluck fur from her throat(Called the Dewlap) to make a snug nest for a Kits(Babies).    Its a good idea to provide a nest box for her. They are born Naked,blind & deaf,like this:http://www.dkimages.com/discover/preview...  At 3+ days they start to grow fur,you CAN handle them at birth,its a bit of a myth that the mother will eat or reject them. However some mothers can be wary of you. A Doe Rabbit will ONLY feed her Kits every 20-24 hours,for 3-5 minutes at a time. She does not stay with them all the time,in fact you may never see her with them,when they are in the nest. The Kits open their eyes at 10-14 days old. At around 16-21 days they will venture from the nest & start to eat the mothers solid food & try & drink from the water bottle. Do NOT give ANY greens,as these can cause major digestive disturbances. You can start to properly handle the Kits at 3+ weeks old.    Do NOT ween the Kits before 7wks old. I prefer 8-9wks old. Its actually illegal to sell rabbits before 8wks old,in the UK.    Hope this helps,please email me,if you need more help.xxx|`|OBW6nzkLaa	i think you should take them all for a trip to the vets .. the vets should know if their pregnant and if they are you can ask them what to do if they are :) .xxx.|`|Z22kPx71aa	have they reached the mating age ?  the mating age minimum is 6 mths to 8 mths .  and the pregnancy will take about 27 days to 31 days so if now the doe hasn't bore anything that means she's not pregnant ...|`|RNJ0NRTTaa	Well we could  never actually tell but our rabbits were allowed to hop around in the garden freely, we had a male and female, and the female got pregnant twice.Whenever she was pregnant she would get pretty fat in comparison to her normal shape and would not move around as freely, she would tend to just sit around.She usually had around  6 - 8 babys.

Rwz3dkQSaa	Goat gestation is around 5 months... It's way too early for her to be looking for a place to kid and going off feed unless she's aborting or she has something else wrong with her.    Also, not seeing them breed isn't a sure thing. I'm currently waiting on a doe to kid any day now who I never saw bred or have a 'messy' tail.    Size doesn't matter. If you look at a goat who has been browsing all day, they tend to look pregnant... bucks and whethers included. That's because their rumen is full of yummy vegetation. At the moment, my buck and my open does look pregnant. Rumen is on the left and Kids are on the right... but at 2mos, you wouldn't be able to tell by looking. Around month 3, you should be able to feel an udder start to develop. If you can't wait, you need to have blood drawn and send it to biotracking.com      I'll tell you right now. There aren't a lot of vets who are experienced with goats. I'm darn lucky to have a network of breeders and a vet who has had goats.     What's her temp? Is she pooping berries or is it clumpy? You could give her a couple cc's of fortified vitamin B complex to stimulate her appetite and I'd also swipe some cud from your buck for her to eat [put good goat bacteria in her rumen]. From what you've said already, it soooounds like early Entrotoxaemia or Listeriosis/Goat Polio.|`|aD1no2cWaa	She could be pregnant. I would take her to a vet that treats animals of that nature.

OaaJ7o9Haa	API water strips are for convenience only. Actually, all test strips are for convenience and a quick look only. API makes a very accurate liquid test kit that I use (and many people will probably recommend). If you get it at a petstore, it'll probably cost you around $30. Look for it on Amazon.com, I found it there for about $19.    40ppm is dangerous, if not toxic. Most aquarists shoot for under 25ppm.

7RbtAOYXaa	Boxers are not dumb.  Again I read answers by people who have no clue about the subject.  They are goofy and funny but extremely smart and easy to train although they can be stubborn at times.  I got my boxer at 4 months and they do love to play.  If you spend time training him you will see how  smart he is.  My boxer is now 9 months and knows -sit, stay, lay down, roll over, dance, spin, shake, come, and is whistle trained to come to me at the sound of my whistle.  Boxers are awesome!|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I don't know what you mean by dumb. Playing and fighting are completely normal, that is how puppies learn.

m0e3a3gWaa	Great Idea!  I do the same thing in my tanks.  Any white Styrofoam in perfectly safe.  You do not want to use and colored ones because the dye.
	don't listen to the first person. only some are picky eaters and their are many ways to get them to eat if they are. some will just stop eating in the winter and will eat again in the spring. You can keep them in a rubber maid container or a glass aquarium. you will need bedding, you can yuse aspen, cypress mulch or newspaper or paper towels. you will need a water bowl, a heat pad and at least one hide. thats about it.You can spent as little or as much as you want. If you realy want a axanthic then you will be spending atleast 200 on the snake.  this is what it will cost.  -snake-$200  rubber maid container-$5  or 20 gal glass tank-$80  bedding-$5  hide$5 or make one for free  heat pad-a must-$20  what ever you do make shure the cage has a locking lid so the snake can not escape. buy a book and ball pythons or google it know what you are getting. ball pythons are very good snakes|`|	i would go to google and put in ball python care, look at all the different web sites to see what they all have to say (they will all say somthing different) and then come back here if your still need to ask questions.|`|	I'm not sure about the cost. But ball python's are very difficult to care for, in the fact that they are very very picky eaters.     Alot of them will starve themselves. You will have to be very careful about them. But they all are like that, and they go through not eating phases.    If you make sure that it's not wiild-bred of wild-captured, it should make it somewhat easier.|`|	Is this your first snake?  Because axanthic ball pythons are expensive, N.E.R.D. has them listed for $4000. I'd say start out with a normal ball python, or a pastel.    Google ball python care to learn more about them.

qXnfaN9Zaa	It may have broken feet you should take it to a vet immediatley|`|KlkUj6uFaa	LOL!    Sorry but that's quite funny, even though I know you must be worried, etc.    Try taking the bird to a vet I suppose for professional advice.|`|dTdLrjFNaa	Cover your windows next time.|`|FWlSFpByaa	It might have broken its leg. Best take it to the vet, because its a small bird it shouldn't cost much|`|R0XoFY6gaa	It should be fine, but you should take to see a vet.  Good luck.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	Take the bird to a vet ASAP.    It is possible the bird has a bruise on the brain leading to brain swelling.  The swelling could cause muscle weakness in the bird's feet.     The bird may also have damage to the nerves in the spinal cord near the neck due to the impact with the window.    The bird may need a systemic anti-inflammatory drug such as a powerful corticosteroid to reduce inflammation in its brain or spinal cord.  The sooner the better.     Whenever any living creature hits its head hard enough to be knocked out, brain swelling is a possibility or a concussion.      A doctor's visit is a must.  If you get it to a doctor the bird will recover.  This is likely an easy fix, if properly and promptly attended to.      These drugs need to be administered quickly to reduce any permanent damage from any possible brain swelling or spinal cord swelling.     Here are links describing head trauma and spinal cord injury resulting in muscle weakness:    http://lifecenter.ric.org/content/2161/i...    http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/symptoms/m...    http://books.google.com/books?id=6QLRqgf...|`|a3Y8vKKtaa	No its just a bit dizzy but I'd keep an extra eye on it just in case.I hope its alright.|`|6KxBqnstaa	No it is just knocked out and stunned. Keep perches very low for a few days and watch it. Hopefully will regain all use of legs and feet. However with that being said it may have done some damage. If does not improve withing a few days I would take to vets for a look at it. Keep bird in a quiet dim lit room and put food and water down low for it. Next time let it out cover all windows as it thinks it can fly through them as all birds do. Same with all mirrors. Also may want to get wings trimmed so this does not happen again. Good luck to the bird and you guys. :)|`|QV6swGUMaa	it is most lightly just stunned ,should be fine in a few hours.feed him and give it a drink to try calm him down.|`|hiJaXOD5aa	I don't think so, give it some time to recover.|`|33J1ucEXaa	listen to beth p|`|K2QwEM4raa	My bird broke his foot and had to have a cast put on it.

7Y8DCpRWaa	Don't know about the adjustable AP, but a friend of mine got the CC and they are horrible. Terrible quality leather and made badly. The seat and leg flap are off, they tip you forward and swing your leg back. I rode in it once and was appalled.     Best to go for a better quality saddle and accept that you will have to use some creative padding to have it suit other horses. Half pads and wither relief pads are a big help, cashel has a great line of pads available.    I have an Antares that has quite a universal fit, half pads help with shoulder clearance, wither relief free up the wither to get your fingers of space, cashel or roma can lift a low fitting saddle, gel ride has pieces of padding for just withers if theyre too low in the front. Never ideal to have to pad up, but in a perfect world every horse would have custom saddles to fit them and various riders.
AraBfesHaa	Their sensitive to ammonia.  I had one that died and I know what killed it (the mollies!)  after that I did a little research and the only thing I can add is if you ever have to medicate your fish with ich medication, move the snails to another container as that particular medication will kill them.  I'm sure there are more little notes to make on having a snail, but I didn't do alot of research.  I figured I'd continue with it when I decide to get another one.|`|N6NunLGVaa	snails dont live to long, and never get neon tetras. thats not there natraul color. they inject it in them, it makes them die faster.|`|P3w07SsGaa	noo i can turn them over thats fine be sure that u dont rip them out when u do it so u need to be gentle now i have one hes in with a bass a pleco and a bunch of cichlids in a 55 gallon and hes cool hes been around for about 3-4 months but ur best bet is to A. be sure ur temp is always between 76-80 (78 is the best temp) and also be sure ur PH and nitrates is good .....go to a LPS most test ur water for free|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	wow you have to many fish that's what happening snails are very delicate
lhOd2hvXaa	The physics of b*tches in season is indeed tricky (giggle).    I have found that they stay pretty much the same throughout their reproductive life.  A girl that is clingy and needy when she's in season will remain clingy and needy in subsequent cycles, a girl that is snarky with other dogs when she is in season will remain snarky in subsequent cycles, etc.  The mess remains the same though :)    And yes, it is indeed a true pain.  When you add in the seasonal howling and pining by the boys in the house it's enough to drive one mad (several times a year).  I'm not sure how BYBs do it but most reputable breeders just know it's a fact of life we have to deal with for the love of our breed.  About twice a year I threaten to alter them all but they somehow know I'm joking.    Good Luck!|`|3giaPYe8aa	Over the last 35 years and many, many intact b*tchs, I have never found there to be a difference between a first heat or any other.  BTW, it you think that closing your neighbors gate or having a fence will keep an intact dog away from your b*tch, think again.  Trust me, where there is a will, there is a way!|`|TpOVmqpHaa	Each heat will be like this.  Have her spayed if you don't like what mother nature deals out. :-)  Oh and the person below me is right - a closed gate is nothing for a male who smells a female in heat.  They will climb fences, chew through doors, etc.  Keep your female inside and safe until she's out of heat.    p.s. Life can be stinky.  We deal with baby diapers, puppy accidents, and bloody b. itches because we love them and it's a small price to pay for the love and enriched lives we get in return.  :)|`|f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	If you don't want to deal with it - get thee to a vet and have her spayed.  It does not get better as time goes on - what it is - is what it is.|`|cETQuE9waa	All heats are the same. They are all a mess and all a pain. You always have extra worries when you have female dogs in heat.    Fences will not stop a male dog either. Dogs can jump, climb, or dig to get to females.   I have always said it is so much easier to have spayed dogs.|`|Um8osMNuaa	My Lab has been the same from her first heat until now and she's three years old. She's very clingy and a little moody, although she doesn't cause too much mess, and she's not smelly. She's never left unsupervised so we've not had to deal with any unwanted pregnancies. lf it wasn't for her being a big girl l'd have had her spayed, but the vet advised me not to, as she could gain even more weight.  lf it's causing you too much trouble then it would be best to spay, otherwise you've got the same thing to look forward to twice a year for the rest of her life.|`|1868dc03c33039f8ae0fe4351eda6159aa	Every dog is different, but i do not think the first heat is any better or worse than the ones following it.   If she was moody and clingy this time, it will happen again next time.  You are better off getting her spayed and you won't have to worry about it.      Also, don't rely on a fence to keep a male dog out.  Males can easily get over a 6' fence to get to a dog in heat.  When your dog is in heat, she can not be out of your sight EVER!  If you have to leave, put her in a crate in the house.|`|jxRiH2e9aa	xD Having fun yet?    I'm sorry to say, but the first heat is not the worst. It never gets better.|`|QUkXsPNIaa	haha yes the joys of an entire female, eh?    As for the first heat being the "worst", I haven't heard this before. As far as I know, most *********/e/s run like clock work and are pretty much all the same and on time for each season. Most, not all.    Get your dog spayed, and you'll have a much easier time, and you'll also be safe gaurding your pet against ovarian/mammary cancers.|`|eDySIDPQaa	One heat is not better than the others, the first or last, all will be like this....you just have to give her some extra loving and space..    and this is with any breed, trust me..

c77qsgdvaa	i made my own for really cheap, it's been in my pond for years and runs/works great. here's what you'll need.    1. a pump with a hose ( mine is 6 feet for my waterfall )  2. a bucket with holes drilled in the sides of it. 1 inch holes every 2 inches all the way around top to bottom.  3. filter floss  4. lava rock.    I just drilled holes in the bucket, put filter floss in the bucket covering the inside top to bottom all the way around. put some lava rock in the bottom. place the pump inside, then cover the pump with the rest of the rocks. place the outtake hose somewhere away from the intake pump ( i have mine coming down a waterfall). And that's pretty much it, i used black bucket that was about a foot tall, just to hide it easier in the pond. The black bucket hides well against the black liner of the pond. Just remember to change the filter floss every month or so. Pretty simple and econimical, all stuff you can get at home depot, hope this helps.|`|t5vQeaSJaa	you do not all ways need filters with just a few goldfish in and lots of plants you just have to get the right balance.If you would like more fish a filter with a U/VlLIGHTn is a big help|`|5EPwDjt8aa	A fountain in the middle is usually enough, but you can buy a cheap pool filter to run for an hour or two a day if you want better clarity.  Don't run it too long though or it will filter all of the essential bits of food out of the water and you fish will suffer and die.|`|1QcAJ35taa	speak to your local aquatics centre they can advise you better as there is so many different filters and pumps etc and can advise u better for what your looking for
YpEswTQdaa	Hi,Congrats.    I own a Mexican Red-Knee Tarantula,they are relatively easy to care for & are great for beginners. She(Conchita) is around 4yrs old we have had her for a couple of years. We got her off a lady that worked at the local zoo. Tarantulas are expensive animals to purchase. However once set-up they are fairly cheap,to feed & care for.Plus they live for 25-30yrs on average!! Mexican Red-Knees are known to be a Friendlier breed/type of Tarantula too.    Here:http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/tarantula...    http://www.keepingexoticpets.co.uk/keepi...    Hope this helps & good luck! xxx    ADD: Oh here you go! http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/si...|`|jyGTlpzTaa	The Chilean rose is the ultimate beginners tarantula, but the mexican red knee is also a good choice.

If Money is a factor go with the rose hair.  When you are picking out your new friend handle it first.  Some can be more aggressive than others.  If your at a store where none of the workers can pick him up to show you go to a differant store.  The animals care takers should be able to help you find one that is used to being held.  Good Luck
JCUfH0CBaa	Wow...sorry, but a horse is probably to big a responsibility. Taking care of a horse can cost thousands of dollars and are mainly for people that:    -Have Acreage  -Live on a farm or at a stable  -Can devote everyday to them  -Can pay the expenses    You aren't your friend, though. Your friend shouldn't have gotten one,anyway.The most you could do is help at a shelter or stable, and keep taking lessons and camps. When your older if you like horses, move somewhere where you are able to take care of a horses.     Think about a dog meanwhile, you won't regret it!|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Hello,  No one is disputing your love for horses, but there's not just the one off cost of buying one to be thinking about.  You must keep it, stable it, buy new bedding, new tack, new food, new kit. Vets fees, care when you are not able to look after it due to other commitments such as school etc.  Your cheer leading would probably not even cover the cost of the oil to rub on a saddle, so giving that up will not help.  The only thing that would help would be if you offered to get a job and pay for it yourself.  Sorry, I know it's your dream, but, it's a big one, and we can't always afford our dreams.|`|WAEDIWz8aa	hunnie, its not like u r asking him to get u a fish..    its obviously that he is reacting this way.    u dont know how much time and effort u need to keep a horse.    but if u really want to. u need to speak to him, and tell him how u feel.     he has to listen to you. and u hv to show him how much this means to you.    good luck|`|la9zji2Uaa	Maybe you could go volunteer at some local stables or a riding school or something to show him your commitment to your dad. They are very expensive, not just to buy but to keep too. Good luck.|`|t2LOcPkLaa	i think you need to sit down and have a serious talk about this with your dad. are you really willing and wanting to give up cheerleading for this? think about it and if you are, tell him that. i don't want to lecture you here, but owning a horse is a huge responsibility and it doesn't sound like you have tons of experience. just because you can ride, it doesn't mean you know how to take care of a horse. i would suggest that you continue taking riding lessons for awhile and learn about horse care to show that you are responsible. an option that you might really want to check out is leasing a horse. it is cheaper than owning one and you aren't fully responsible for taking care of it. many stables will offer that and they might even let you purchase the horse eventually if you ask them.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	You need to prove to him you can care for one....which is NOT CHEAP. In fact, this one of the most expensive hobbies around! A horse runs at least a few thousand dollars, and renting a stable to keep it in cost much too. If your dad is made of money- keep bugging him about it. If not, then just stick with cheerleading......one fall off a horse, means your hobby is pretty much OVER.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Get a job, do odd jobs for people and start saving. You are asking a bit much of your dad to go out and buy you an animal that can cost thousands of pounds/dollars. And by the way, shelter horses might be free, but they cost the same amount to keep. Buying the horse isnt even the expensive part...its the boarding, equipment, feeding, shoeing, vetting and insurance that costs the real money.|`|bJtUNkmhaa	make him an offer he cant refuse, or if he does refuse...put a horses head in his bed like in the godfather film!|`|xtieIDTyaa	Tell him that if he gets you a horse, You will remember it when you are older and win the lotto, You will buy him that car hes always wanted  =D    (If he doesn't drive or hasn't much intrest in cars, Improvise) Lol.|`|jIv75wi8aa	Keeping horses is awfully, awfully expensive. I wouldn't buy you one if I was your father either. Get a dog.|`|1kQBEDnwaa	Don't bother. They are extremely hard work, and if you really do have a passion, then it will wait until you are old enough to get your own.  Too many horses are abandoned or sold on because they were bought on a whim and the owner gets bored. Remember, they are intelligent creatures and should be yours for life if you ever do have one. Good luck when you're older, but not now, as you are much too young to appreciate the love and attention involved in keeping one.|`|LYO0Y8lHaa	I have the exact same problem as you but with my mum, i really want a horse and im not allowed one and i know im not getting one. because we cant afford one. But i have lessons every saturday and most of the time stay and help out.  so first of all can you and your dad afford a horse? if not then dont keep bugging him, its not fare if he cant afford it.  but if you can you need to find a way of proving you will continue to look after a horse and wont get bored of it or mistreat it.  anyway goodluck!|`|GsRB4ZwLaa	Draw pictures of horses in your free time, talk to you dad and others about horses, not like "I want a horse!" but just as normal conversation. Join groups, clubs, and volunteer with horses ( if you can ), this may sound weird ( especially the drawing part ) but showing your love of horses ( or any animal, for that matter ) can really work!     P.S. Another thing you might want to do, is save up your money. ( If anyone asks, just say your " saving it for a rainy day " or '' for that one day" or another reason.|`|q6wmIzmHaa	owning a horse is a great experience BUT there are a few questions u need to ask..    will you be up there everyday at the crack of dawnn to feed him, turn him out and pick up his crap?  if not can u afford to keep him in a livery stables?  are you willing to sacrifice all your days out with friends because he will need constant exercise and care?  are you willing to be out there in a field come rain or snow to ride and look after him?  are you capable or still loving this horse even after he throws you off/kicks you/ bites you etc?  are you willing to do this for the next 15 or so years (depending on the age you buy him)?    because if you have to answer no or even maybe to any of these questions then maybe a better idea is a loan. i've had horses all my life and i know that when i was younger, loaning was so much easier.    its much much cheaper and you ride when the actual owner can't, so you can negotiate days that are suitable for the both of you. you won't have to worry about mucking out and vets bills, just you and a horse and you can still ride it as if it were your own, and still groom it and care for it. just that when you can't make it down, it isn't that much of a big deal. i think your dad wwould appreicate the lower costs as well. if you can prove your dedication to him with a loan pony, then he'll be more willing to buy you your own! it takes time but its a wonderful thing and you gain sooooo much experience! it convinced my parents to buy me my first pony, it might work for you!
lavd3UHmaa	The nipples are the first signs that your cat could be pregnant.  When a cat is not pregnant, they are light brown/creme color..about two weeks after the cat is pregnant, the nipples are a dark pink/red color.  I didn't notice any other outward signs until she actually started to get big and you could feel the babies.  The babies would be showing on the sides of her belly because her uterus is in a v shape.|`|Aoa2fwQgaa	It's very possible. Check out my source sites below for how to check at cat for signs of pregnancy. The first one states that it's usually three weeks after mating that the queen's nipples with enlarge and become more pink.   Before you decide to follow through with the spay appointment, you obviously either want to a) wait it out to make sure she's pregnant (gestation period for a cat is 65-78 days I think) and/or b) get her checked by the vet|`|kFBLtojLaa	possibly    actually yes    congratulations|`|wlm2BPqwaa	if u can try to feel her stomach and if u feel bumps against your hand then she's pregnant.
OIRI5Ok7aa	Spray her with a water bottle every time she goes up there.  Keep a bottle handy, then when she wakes you up (or you see her go up there), spray her and say no.  After a couple of times, she won't go up there anymore.  I used this technique to keep my cat out of the dog food, and he won't even touch it anymore, so it works pretty well.  And it won't hurt them at all.|`|Aoa2fwQgaa	You can put a barrier up there, whether it be a large box on top or a kiddie fence around it, you can put tin foil on it (cats don't like the feeling of tin foil), or when she's up there you can give her a little spray of water with a squirt bottle. There are probably other ways as well but those are the best three I can think of :)   good luck!|`|4LuPMBQZaa	Easy, dont put stuff on top of the refrigerator!    Put it somewhere else    Cats are very independent, their going to do whatever they want.|`|GqrRBZ3faa	What everyone else said is great. But cats like to sleep in high places because it makes them feel secure and non-threatened. So if you eventually get her to stop laying up there, introduce her to another place high off the ground where she can sleep. Try putting a bed on top of a bookcase or an entertainment center. That way you can control where she sleeps and she still feels safe.|`|gCAJaFnyaa	Thanks for asking this question.  I have a cat who did the same thing a couple of times.  She jumped on the frig then up to my cabinets which are open on the top, and started knocking some tins down in the middle of the night.  I have heard about the aluminum foil trick and will try to use that.|`|WyPpe741aa	Try putting some cat repellents. Check out this: http://www.petsmart.com/family/index.jsp...|`|BLMh0dG6aa	I've found saying NO!, very effective, especially if you back it up with treats when they get down, and also say NO! when they start acting like their going to, if she starts hesitating and especially if she starts to look to you for permission before getting up their it means its working.    But to balance it off I'd also give her allot of praise and positive attention when she does other good things
	the females are bigger then the males, and the males look more slender, kind of like other fish like guppies or etc. also its hard to tell there gender intell they are fully grown, the females fill up with eggs.

fbe10d62d2ef0f646c50ef6eb7c80a2faa	I really don't know the specific answer to that but it could be for mating reasons.

Here's a site that'll help you a lot.     http://www.ultimatebettas.com/index.php?...|`|OsVswissaa	Male bettas take care of the eggs til they hatch so they're naturally very territorial as a nesting instinct.

mWCKTAouaa	my father used to own a ten gallon fish tank with gold fish. He had about 3-4 goldfish and 2 catfish.(gold fish were two tailed) if u plan on getting oens that are like 6 inches long, yes u need a ten gallon for one but if u get 3 two tailed goldfish in that tank they will be fine. my cuszin kept 3 4 inch long goldfish (two tailed in a ten gallon plus catfish and they survied for 4 years). keep like 3 two tailed ones|`|nIG0j9wUaa	Wtf a gold fish you better drop a goldfish cracker in there an d let it bite and chase that|`|oMTsDcNBaa	You gotta do some research before you get any pet.    http://www.kokosgoldfish.com/care.html|`|FrAXx2iaaa	One goldfish needs a ten gallon tank.  they produce a lot of waste and can get big depending on the type.  Try to keep the same species together, it shouldn't be a problem with Goldfish though.  The fish might have died from the water quality.  Do you have a filter?

The only thing you can safely add is shrimp as they have virtually no impact on the bioload.|`|FrAXx2iaaa	you are about overloaded.  i wouldn't suggest the shrimp.  they are known to mess up the fins on fish.  It doesn't happen all the time, but it is common.  What ever you do do not add a male Betta to the tank.  You might wake up and only have him left.  Bettas are highly aggressive fish.|`|rdp95817aa	i would buy a bigger tank if you want more fish and 2 males in 1 tank they could hurt each other especially betta
YpEswTQdaa	"Sometimes you will feel her tummy get tight and hard, and there may be noticeable lumps. Sometimes she will gain a lot of weight. Sometimes her nipples will become very pronounced. It can be very hard to tell!! Be prepared just in case, and giving her at least 40 days from the last day that she was with the male before you decide she isn't for sure is usually a good rule of thumb.

DNiq1Vcjaa	Watch any horse playing in the field and they will exhibit many of the advanced dressage moves... you are merely teaching them to do it on command and with consistency, straightness, suppleness etc. Piaffe and passage are the moves which require a natural ability (many top trainers ask for a few steps early on in training to ensure it will be there later).    Although many horses can be taught dressage moves, they may not be good enough to get high marks in competition. You should also remember that advanced dressage is hard work for the horse and may result in more wear and tear on the horses joints.    Why don't you leave your horse where he is because he is settled and work on him yourself using what you have learnt on your job? There may be the opportunity to take him to the yard for training but keep him living on his existing yard. In any case you could always move him later if you decide it would be worth moving him.....    Good luck with the new job|`|MaAtfDV7aa	You can attempt to teach any horse advanced dressage, but every horse has a limit of just how far they can go, depending on traits such as conformation, ability, and mental capacity.|`|XL62syrCaa	Yes of course you can. It actually helps their training and is GOOD for them (teaches to carry them selves better) ANY horse can do it. It doesn't matter if they have a "springy" step as the first person said. I had a pinto (laziest horse I ever owned) that excelled in dressage. It teaches horses to lift their legs. And yes he can do those advanced movement. So yes it would be worth it. They may allow him out with the youngsters (or even their older ones if they are a barn that believes a horse should be a horse)     OHH and I am SOOO jealous! lol
xZslxv9qaa	use the coditioner first and if you have a good enough conditioner then you may not need a softener|`|5QG9Zrjaaa	Clean first, condition second.    Combi first, ledersoft after.

AraBfesHaa	O.k. Ich looks like grains of salt or tiny bubbles on the fish's scales.  There could be just one, or many.  If that's what it is go to walmart, petsmart, or petco and get some quick cure.  it's the fastest working ich medicine I've tried.  Follow directions, I think it's 1 drop per gallon.  Depending on where you get it, it's $2.29-2.99 and lasts quite a long time.  The spots will be gone in a couple of days, but continue to use the drops for as long as it says on the bottle or package.  Just make sure you're pretty certain that's what it is or you'll be treating the wrong thing and what it IS could be getting worse in the meantime.  That's what it sounds like though.  Can you describe the spots better than that?|`|Xa0ndGNjaa	Change the water in the tank.|`|ycNt74yyaa	Sounds like ich!    ich is fairly easy to treat. you can either raise the temperature to about 82-84 for two weeks, doing consistent water changes and gravel vacuums to get all the spores. or you can use medications (there are LOTS available that treat ich), or you can do both in conjunction. also, i'd recommend a water change either way, as it could be a result of bacteria in your water.|`|81fffddd6bb0bf3234c91426166d23c5aa	I am sorry to hear it.

Also there are plenty Chemical treatments since this is a common illness. So better talk to a pet shop owner in your area and ask them for  medicine.

gixuJh1Uaa	You'll be inundated with replies from the"pony club/horse n hound/my pony" brigade, they'll tell you to "change the bit", sit deeper and all the other crap, when actually all you need to do is learn to ride as "we" teach and are taught in the racing world - Let her down.    Get you're backside out of the saddle, allow the reins to come to you re hands along the neck, keep you re legs straight and give her enough rein so as her head is not restricted - Within 2 minutes she'll say " wot, no-ones pulling my mouth about, this is not fun now cos im running within myself and not having to fight to have fun".    I admit it takes some bottle so let her down first time, but as soon as she stops fighting you, you'll be able to teach her how you need her to be.|`|MaAtfDV7aa	Perhaps she bucks not because she's excited, but because she's either ouchy or you ask for it wrong. Example: you accidentally clamp your knees into her and jab her with your heels/spurs. And it sounds like she needs to know that you're in charge if you continually let her misbehave on the cross ties.|`|SrkoKZWuaa	Grooming/ Tacking up:        I would suggest investing in a tie ring. They can be bought on Clinton Anderson's  website. This will allow you to tie her up and if she freaks out or whatever she can pull out a little slack and won't feel claustrophobic. When she gets better about pulling you can use a higher setting that will make it harder for her to pull out slack.  I would suggest tying her up and leaving her there.  Start out with only 20min or so and work your way up to a few hours. She needs to learn patience and this is a great way to do it! Just make sure that she has water and your all set to go.     Crow hopping @ Canter:       Go back to ground work. She's just being lazy and telling you that she doesn't want to do it!  Put her in a round pen and get her feet moving! Make her walk, trot and stop. When she understands the basics ask her to go from a trot to a canter. Make her work at it. She probably won't want to at first and might rear or even kick at you. This is fine just make sure that you have a lune whip or something. If she refuses to go point to  the direction you want her to go and tap her shoulder (with the whip) 4 times and if she still doesn't go hit her shoulder very firmly with continuous rhythm until she goes then lower the whip as a reward. Don't hit her for rearing, when she comes back down to earth just send her off again and make her move. When she gets really good at this and will do all the transitions for you (this may take a few days)  then you can start riding her again. Don't be afraid to make her sweat, just give her breathers when she needs them and cool her down appropriately.    Hope I helped! :D|`|Qj9pPMf5aa	Why don't you try turning your horse out right before you ride. Or you can even lunge your horse. And try  tacking your horse up in their stall, my horse sounds the same as your and that worked for me, finally, if your horse still has energy after a lunge, or rushed towards a jump, that mean they enjoy it. So they won't really like it if you turn them in circles every time they get to fast. For example, if i am about 7 strides away from a jump and my horse is rushing it, I would turn a large circle away  from the jump and then let him go at it. But if they keep rushing, turn away from the jump and make a large circle around it. Hope that helps... =D|`|An2AopAqaa	Your horse may be bucking from excitement. I loaned a horse who would buck during canter and always try to go faster. I could usually tell when he was about to buck so could brace myself and always sit through it; because of this it was never a problem for me.     She may be bucking just because she has too much energy and is full of beans. Try lunging her before you ride. I'm training a horse at the minute who throws herself around and bucks a little. The week before last she bucked and threw me off so I lunged her for a good half an hour (she's quite unfit) until she was puffing and tired. Then I got back on and continued to ride and she didn't put a hoof wrong.     Just make sure you and her are properly warmed up before any cantering. When you do ask for canter be condifent and relaxed. Try lots of hacking in just walk and trot and keep any faster work in confined areas like a menage or sectioned off piece of the field until you are entirely comfortable with it.     [:|`|YHpePjb9aa	yer my old horse was like that when i bought him. I bought him off a very novice, nervous lady and he had just taken the biscuit for 2 yrs... he would drag her across the yard, bolt, buck, nap (just so she wouldnt ride him) and then started to get arsey in the stable and started kicking. To stop his bucking fits and that i rode him into the ground (getting him fit at the same time) untill he realised that there was something more exciting than strolling around an arena. He would buck, take hold and bolt in the arena to start with but after much determination and patience he started to come back to me and riding him became fun. His jumping was immpecable but the lady had let him take the pee so he would run out or refuse or just demolish the course. It took me 6 months to get him easy to handle and ride. After 8 years he is still a nutter.... still takes the pee out of people and will take advantage of a novice rider but has come to realise that i mean business and what i say goes. He has hunted and evented for the last 7 years and has shown to a high standard. You just need to make the horse realise that jumping is fun.... stable manners are needed (you could just tie up... walk out and leave her for a while keeping an eye on her every so often to makesure she;s not got caught up or something; like re-halter breaking a youngster). If she starts to buck when cantering just ride through it and if you can give him a quick tap across the bum with a whip (she might buck again) but he will soon work out that a buck equals a tap. When you are jumping work on ground poles and gymnastic jumpings and do a fair bit of flatwork to tire her out a bit before hand.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	Cross ties might help with the tying, then she or he is not faced by a wall and until he tries to walk forward then he does not know he is actually tied, though obviously you would need two walls set apart.    For the cantering, can you lunge her before you get on board to let her let off steam?  You do not say whether you have an arena but lunging or free running to begin with would be good.    In canter, I wonder if her back hurts (bucking could be a sign of exuberance or pain somewhere) or if her saddle is fitting slightly wrong.  A saddle should be checked by a professional as horses change shapes as they get fitter or fatter.  She might also be anticipating a jab in the mouth and would rather that did not happen thank you very much so she might be putting up defence mechanisms to counter that.    If you do have an arena try asking for canter in a short corner say H to A, slow your seat swing and she will have to steady to keep comfortable.  Use plenty of half halts with the outside reins, though not jabbing, but keep the leg and seat on to keep her going forward.  If she is going forward then she cannot buck. Also keep your hands raised a bit more when she is in canter until she relaxes.    Whatever it is that is causing the problem, it is going to take time.  But do not worry, it is just a glitch.  Has she just started this or has she always been like it?  What is her age?    It is rather difficult to answer without seeing what she and you are doing as a whole.    May I also suggest a calming feed supplement?|`|KdLhlP3Yaa	If your horse as bad cross tie manners if you can spend the time you can do what my trainer has for a horse that gets obnoxious in them. This horse is loud, tosses head and attempts to rear when left alone for any reason in cross ties  So when she takes her break she has a corner mirror so she can still watch him and sits in the break room that is connected to the walkway where the horse is in the cross ties. She will place the horse in there til she is done eating. She comes back and by then the horse is calm and relaxed so she lets them back out. It worked very nicely for this particular horse, the horse now knows that acting up in cross ties means more time in them.|`|6fpgClqnaa	To teach your horse to stop bucking, you could probably turn her in a tight circle each time she bucks. Each time she bucks, get her to stop by pulling on your left or right rein, and turn her in a circle. If you keep doing this every time she bucks, she will get the message and stop, because most horses don't like turning in tight circles.     Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|3LMZuuE8aa	For The Bucking:    Take up dancing or cycling, these will help your balance.    For The Not Standing Still:    Try and give your horse her her hard feed tied up when she stands still. And try to giver her a haynet when grooming. Or find her very itchy spot and make grooming special. Tire your horse out before giving her her full groom. And try and keep grooming short and work your way up to nice long grooms and baths.    Hope I helped|`|MzeIhT1Qaa	hey     i used to have a mare with the exact same issues. when i tried her to buy her she did exactly this an the bucks got increasingly bigger and bigger. it was clear excitment and i just went with it, sat back let her get on with it and didnt come off. but obviously this is unacceptable behaviour. so what i did was i became as erratic as she was. id start in walk and move up to trot, and just do square turns constantly like left, right, left, right, left left, right right, then like 10m circle each time her attention slipped. as this way she couldn't anticipate my next move and because everything i was doing was so busy and erratic she had to focus on that completely or she would just fall over, which then engaged her and focused her so she stopped the bucking and paid attention cos it got to the point where that was the easiest thing to do and i think i woul do this for about 15 minutes for a month or so and eventually she just stopped. but it would definitely be worth getting her back checked and her saddled checked as it could be a twinge when she changes to canter or something like that. in terms of ground manners. give her something to focus on for example. carrots cut them up really small and put them in a deep bucket and then she has to work to get them and will ignore you, maybe put some bread in there too as horses love it but is very hard for them to chew. something like that. she sounds like shes very intelligent and gets bored easily and doesnt like what she deems 'unnecessary fuss'     good luck and i hoped this helps    xx|`|01f359dd88881e20e546e6d6268a6e04aa	Check saddle fit, My TB had the same problem, he had  a vertebra out in his back from the saddle fit.|`|AA12212950	I'd be tempted to get her back checked as acting up when you're tacking up together with the bucking suggests that something might be a bit sore.    If there is nothing wrong I'd be tempted to get some of the fizz out by either doing a lot of trot work or some lunging before you even try a canter. If that doesn't work it might be worth trying a canter early on when you ride i.e. don't spend ages warming up in walk and trot. Sometimes they get over excited because they want to do it and they aren't being allowed.|`|lbJe2hNqaa	a stronger bit might work or half halting her
h4wNRqf9aa	blacklight is not the same spectrum as actinic, and would do nothing for corals    honestly i don't know why you're opposed to T5's.. they are in my honest opinion probably the best lighting source next to LEDs (and at a fifth of the price of LEDs)    they are reasonably cheap  long lasting  produce little heat  and intense    it's the perfect package      30 gallons are also a great tank to use since many lighting companies include 36" units as one of their standard sizes, so you could get a wide array of lights to suit whatever you're needs may be

7HhD7FIQaa	No, the paper is processed and has harmful chemicals in it. DO NOT use paper.|`|xyPpruSjaa	Any kind of ink is very harmful and toxic for rodents. I wouldn't use just plain shredded paper either because it does NOTHING for odor control and it gets wet and moldy and sticks to everything, plus you can see all the poop and pee your hamster has made because it's white and you can tell when it's wet. It isn't very attractive :-\    I advise that you get a commercial bedding from the pet store. If you choose to do so, DO NOT get cedar, pine, softwood based, scented, or dusty beddings. These can cause liver malfunction, Wet Tail (a common rodent disease), respiratory infection, etc. I use Sunseed Freshworld bedding from petsmart, and it works GREAT! It looks really good, it's inexpensive, good quality, and controls odor well.    I know you're just trying to save money, but when considering that a life is in your hands, you can't choose stuff because it's cheap. :-\    If you need any help or have any questions email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com    Edit: Why a pet shop you say? Because it has things that are MEANT for pets and are usually safe...not always though...|`|YZYhgvA7aa	Well you can use recycled paper but i advise that you buy it from a pet shop|`|3e0rDOWTaa	The paper would have to be unbleached and have no ink.

lCTPAHPEaa	If they are both the same sex, I've read about gerbils trying to show dominance this way or maybe even trying to rub their scent gland (located on their stomachs) onto the other gerbil.

LIC7rb0oaa	Have you got a bowl?  If you have, fill the bowl once a day with dried food, which you can get for guinea pigs in pet shops.  Then a couple of pieces of lettuce, or some cucumber and carrot pieces, or maybe half an apple. Put them in and then take out what is left about every two days and put fresh stuff in.  If you don't have a bowl, and you can get them for guinea pigs and rabbits, etc. from most pet shops pretty cheap, maybe a cup a day?

3e0rDOWTaa	she is probably stressed and once the babies have been rejected, she probably won't take them back again. There is little you can do when they are this young. Just keep the cage in a quite place and don't touch the mother or babies unless you need to change the water or feed her.|`|aEQWHUcWaa	well she could have noticed that the baby is not healthy and didn't want to care for it.

2Zb0eNfeaa	It happens all the time. Yes, it's a domination thing. In nature they would compete for the same food sources and the male guppy probably just wants the territory for himself. Put more hiding places for the molly to get away such as bushy plants or caves or driftwood.|`|rWkq61XQaa	Its probably being dominant,what i'm saying is it may be fighting it may impress a female,or sometimes fish will attack weaker fish just to kill them.If you want to get them to stop you should probably separate them.
mJmPZxJNaa	Not sure about the gerbils and dwarf hamsters, but every hamster is different. I've had a syrian and a dwarf in separate cages and I'd take them out and they would play with each other.  My friend tried to do the same thing (I told him not to, because it's very rare that they got along) and they fought and the dwarf got hurt really bad (still alive).  If you were to get dwarf hamsters, I'd get two, but make sure you've got a big enough cage and make absolutely SURE they are the same sex (I'd recommend 2 females).    Have fun with your hamsters. :)|`|xyPpruSjaa	The hamsters would only fight with the gerbils if they are housed together. PLEASE do not cage them together. Buy 2 10 or 20 gallon aquariums to put them in and use sticky backed WHITE velcro to attach the water bottles. Suprisingly, they are cheaper than most cages and gerbils and hamsters can chew through the plastic on cages. Especially gerbils. Get a mesh lid for the top of the tank. DONT ADD WATER! lol!    Anyway, on to the real question. Dwarf hamsters rarely fight with one another, but can get very territorial at times. If it's your sister's first hamster, only get 1 because dwarfs can be really fast and nippy.    Good luck! Gerbils are GREAT pets, as well as hamsters...I guess...lol!!|`|aEQWHUcWaa	don't put gerbils and hams togehter.

So yea get sol. Ham|`|3e0rDOWTaa	if it is her first hamster, I would recommend a solitary male or female (syrian hamster) as they are easier to handle and tame. Dwarves may fight if their cage is too small or if their cage is not one big space. Sometimes they will fight anyway. And you should not let your hamster(s) and gerbils get close to eachother outside of their cages or through their cages (if the cage is wire)|`|gTXUcd1maa	If she is a first time owner go with a Syrian, nicknamed "teddy bears" they are larger in size, easier to handle, and bite less. NEVER put two syrians together. Also, yes, I would keep the gerbils away because they could fight. Good luck!|`|Enr7zACMaa	I ahve 2 chinese dwarf hamsters they are both female. They never fought they love each other. It will be fine to have 2 girl hamsters it is better then one. If you get one you have to pay more attention to them. If the gerbil and hamsters are in the same cage then they all will fight but if not then it is fine.|`|Jg9I7ABOaa	yes they will fight. one may die. and the other may not. cause they will fight over food, toys, water, and shelter. they have to be family or they grew up togther
N2jvxYPcaa	Oh - I just love horse colour questions, and this is a good one.  First of all, let's discuss bay and brown. If a black horse also has the agouti gene, the black will be restricted to certain areas. In a bay horse the black will be restricted just to the points (mane, tail and legs) In a brown horse the black will be removed from the "soft" areas, namely the muzzle, and flank. There can be a HUGE range in horses that vary in bay and brown - many look truely black and some are very light in color looking almost buckskin. Sometimes the only way to tell a black from a bay or brown is by DNA testing, looking for the agouti gene (which a true black will not have) Especially since there are true black horses which are "fading " blacks and sunbleach quite badly, but do not have the agouti gene.  But looking at your photo - I do not believe your horse has a black gene of any sort.  I believe your horse is a dark form of a red gene. You said that chestnut cannot have black hairs, but that is not correct. Some forms of chestnut, especially liver chestnuts, can be so dark they appear almost pitch black, but if DNA tested are dark reds and not in the black family. APHA defines chestnut as "dark red or brownish red, mane and tail may be red, dark brown or flaxen" I have seen several chestnuts so dark they were mistaken for bays at first glance, I believe you have one of those. I guess this because his legs are not dark enough to qualify for true black. Remember, all bays and browns are black horses with black removed from their body, but remaining in their legs. Yes, your horse's mane and tail are dark, but that is possible for a deep chestnut. And in the photos the mane and tail do not appear to be a true, dark black, but more a blackish brown colour, which is quite possible for chestnut.  At first I also considered the smoky dapple gene, since that will take a horse and lighten the points (so a bay smoky dapple will have light amber points instead of true black) but after thinking about it decided it couldn't be smoky dapple because then your horse's mane and tail would be very light coloured.  Do you have info on your horse's parent's coloration? If the mare and sire were chestnuts, then you cannot have a black toned horse since red cannot throw the black gene. But even if both were in the black tones you can get everything - hetrozygous blacks carry one red gene and one black and can throw everything from bays, blacks, sorrels, chestnuts, and browns.  The only true answer is DNA testing. Pictures are only a small part of the information!|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Brown.  No black points, but not chestnut.  Because the maane and tail are black...|`|HCuArmpGaa	i would say a liver chestnut or a bay.|`|RThxTnHZaa	he does look bay maybe a dark chestnut? not sure but i would say bay the only reason i wouldn't say he is bay is because he doesn't have the black legs.|`|vow5ULxTaa	brown.  A Chestnut is much redder and has a red or flaxen tail.  Bays have black points on there ears and legs.    a True Brown:  http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2344/2272...    True Bay:  http://s159.photobucket.com/albums/t133/...    Dark Chestnut:  http://www.gestuet-sprehe.com/cms/upload...|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Wild bay, also known as a faded bay.  Black mane & tail with limited black on legs, limited to fetlock area. Bays can have red or lighter black hairs through the mane and tail.  ""Wild" Bay is considered a subtype of Bay. As mentioned above, the characteristic of this subtype is that the black on the leg will only extend up to the pastern or fetlock. When it reaches the cannon it fades out leaving an interplay of red and black areas. This subtype of Bay is considered fairly rare." http://www.equinecolor.com/bay.html|`|s9a1yKFjaa	http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|XL62syrCaa	Your horse is considered Brown.

Dani|`|QpElKY8Kaa	He's called a 'mealy' or 'muley' BAY.  The Agouti gene fades the black points on the legs, at the flanks and around the muzzle.    As long as the mane and tail are black, he's a bay, not a brown horse.    Black mane and tail, NOT chestnut, sorrel, etc.|`|FWlSFpByaa	He looks like a Fading Black. Usually black with a slight brown tint, some horses are opposite fadding brown with slight black. He sure is prettty|`|at7LXbEfaa	I think hes a cherry bay|`|KyHiCSKeaa	I think that the contrast between the colors of his brown/reddy body and his mane (which appears black in the pix) would make me call him some kind of bay...but I'm not an expert.|`|E0ecctCiaa	My friend is a reall good expert in horses so she says it may be chestnut...I don't know what the names are for certain colors but I think it's reddish brown.|`|mzgEgG57aa	Maybe you're thinking this through a little too much..  Isn't color pretty subjective?  Like how some people think that periwinkle is more blue and others think it's more purple.  I dunno, but he looks bay to me, since he is brown with a black mane and tail, and i'm pretty sure when people look at him they don't say "Oh, well, that horse must either be a wild bay or a chestnut depending on the breed because his legs..."  uhh.  yeah.|`|44de18facbbb84a65b0b415f318f53adaa	I'd say chestnut.|`|01f359dd88881e20e546e6d6268a6e04aa	Your horse is considered a brown.|`|qW0tq6A2aa	he's a bay. ive seen many bays where there is not much black around legs but regardless is still considered a bay.     he's definitely not a brown because browns would be considered much darker and it is not so easy to distinguish points. not to mention you say he doesnt get any darker? yea no. definitely not brown.... he's way too light.    does he go outside much? because the sun can highlight the tail and mane making it more confusing to tell. however, a bay is having black on three points. the three points are mane, tail, and legs. your horse has black on all three. therefore, he is a bay. i have seen a detailed book on horse colors before (i forget the name, sorry) and the different colors of bay depend on the actual brown color of the body. so if you want to know EXACTLY what color bay he is, you can find that out.    however, i would go with bay.

cXK9sY1raa	Seems fine to me. I always only feed my fish twice a day. They can go for a little while without food so the three times a day has always seemed a little too much to me. I prefer to underfeed than overfeed, it causes less problems.    As long as they seem healthy and happy, you're doing a good job :-)    Remember with fancies it's a good idea to soak all the food you given them for a few minutes first, it stops it expanding in their stomachs and causing constipation.|`|D178335Paa	Two - 3 times a day should be plenty. I ahve 2 fantail and 2 carp. They are quiet larger and i feed mine 2-3 times a day|`|J1F3SRJsaa	I think that depends on how much you want your fantails to grow and the size tank that they're in. but otherwise I think your doing fine.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	With goldfish it' usually best to borderline underfeed them.  And yeah ten mins seems like an awful lot!  Especially since these guys are prone to eating themselves sick!  I'd do once a day for a min or so, maybe twice a day every other day?  Or  a few mins every other day.  A good thing to have in hand are peas.  If they eat themselves such and start having swimming issues, offer them the insides of a cooked and cooled pea.  These can do wonders for internal bloating and blockages that fantails are so prone too.  Plus, it's really good for them and they usually really like them : )    Best of Luck!|`|2Zb0eNfeaa	That's fine. It's great that you don't overfeed.

Bw18seFqaa	Very good pets    They have wonderful temperments.. very friendly dogs, easy to train, eager to please.    If raised and socialized with children and other pets, they are great with them..  some of them can have abit of a prey drive towards small caged pets tho... expecially birds.. they were originally bred for water sport and retrieving.    either of the cuts you mentioned are fine for a pet, just depends on which you like best..  my dad's poodle is kept in a kennel cut.. we leave the coat abit longer in the winter tho.    I raised one 12 or so years ago when I was in high school to be a service dog.. and my dad currently owns one..  every Standard I have met had a great temperment and personality.  Aside from the grooming needs, this is a breed I'd reccommend for a first time dog owner.      ADDED  Ive seen some aggression in the smaller poodles.. but ussually its the "small dog syndrome" you see because of owners who spoil their small dogs...  the owners let the dogs get away with the aggression because "they are cute and little"    I have never met an aggressive standard.|`|097CKwBWaa	Poodles are a bit more aggressive than many other breeds.  They are very trainable though.    Coonhounds and blood hounds are very good around kids and cats (ifsocialized early) because they are so chill.  Only problem is that they are barkers and they like to run away... a fenced yard is a great idea.|`|WSkLpkXSaa	They rank up in the  2 position for intelligence in dogs. I have a mixed poodle breed, very easily trained & social also.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	They are basically like the smaller versions only in a bigger body.  It all depends on how they are raised &the quality of their breeding.  They can be good with kids but might knock them down playing.    Expect to pay a pretty penny regardless of which clip you pick.  Here standards prices easily cost between 80-120 or an easy guess is at least double the price for the smaller poos.  It takes about twice as long to groom so you pay according. So be sure to figure grooming price at least every 4-8wk in your budget.
3n60UxgQaa	Are you sure you conditioned them for at least two weeks?  This step is important and should not be skipped.    EDIT: You did pair them up right?

qEp9fxU9aa	I have over 2,000 gallons of aquariums and have never paid over $1 per gallon for any aquarium.  Look in the paper, garage sales, e-bay, craigslist, aquariums club, etc.  For $240 you could easily get a large full set up.  Don't buy a used heater, get a new Hagen submersible heater on line for less than $40.  My Hagen 250 watt submersible made it from 1987 until last year when I broke it.  If you know what you are doing you can get some good used filters though I don't know what size aquarium you are looking for.  I picked up a New Hagen FX5 canister for my 360 for a little over $100 new and it works great.  Don't buy this for anything smaller than a 6' tank.  For 4' long and smaller aquariums I often use a hang on the back type filter or a sponge filter.  I usually don't like canister filters except the Hagen I mentioned.  I don't know what type of lighting you want though a top and light strip usually comes with the aquarium.  If not ask about it because they have it somewhere and are happy to throw this in.  Stands can be expensive though they are easy and cheap to make so that cost is up to you.  Look around and I'm sure you can get at least a fully loaded 75 gallon for $240 and may be able to get a 125.  I bought my 100 gallons for $50, my 125, 135 and 150 were all $90 - $100 and came with stands.  My 360 was $100 also though a bear to move.  My 180 was $180 though it's an early 50's stainless custom made and well worth it.  My 225 was a less than $200 though I don't recall, it might have been 150.  Just look around and know where you want the aquarium then go from there.  You can easily make it happen with a little searching and $240.|`|	i recommend you get a 45 gallon -55 gallon. for a kit its like 200 dollars 40 dollars left for accessories.|`|	Try ebay or criagslist for used kits.  Maybe check out a few garage sales on the weekends.  You should definitely be able to get a pretty good tank for 240.  Wait for some good sales at your local pet stores as well.  Best of Luck!|`|	Magoos & Dotty's, Other Local mom and pop fish/pet stores usually have the best sales for fish tanks. They usually include things inside depending on the place. 55 gallons is about 180-250|`|	Yes, look at buying a used system, you can often find a 55 gallon tank with a fresh water set up for about $50.00 - $80.00. Check want adds, ebay, garage and estate sales.   some pet shops will sell used tanks also,call around and dont be afraid to test out the tank fo leaks etc. befor you buy.|`|	Well we had a 29 Gallon Fish Tank and we wanted a bigger one so we went out and got a 125 gallon...I think a 75 gallon is a good size but you can look on http://www.craigslist.com and stuff for more inexpensive ones...I think that South American Cichlids are good ones although we still have our 29 gallon and we have African Cichlids...South Americans should be less aggressive but in our 125 gallon we have a whole bunch of tropical fish...but they're the more aggressive tropical type.   I don't think you have to sell your 25 but it's up to you...|`|	get a tank for saltwater fish. they are super fun to keep. if you have that budget, go for a twenty gallon or possibly look for a bigger used one. get a nice filter too. some good starter saltwater fish are green chromises, percula clownfish, strawberry basslets, any kind of firefish... they are so fun. you really should try. here are my kinds of tanks if these inspire you at all. like they said, try to find a used one for a cheap price. i have four fish tanks, a brackish ten gallon with a few black mollies, a brackish 20 gallon with a geen spotted puffer, a saltwater 75 gallon reef tank with 2 seahorses, 2 green chromises, a shrimp, some snails, a green mandarin, and a sailfin blenny. the other tank i have is a 90 gallon hexagon, and i am planning it right now. it will be a saltwater tank with maybe a mini-octopus and a puffer or a longhorn cowfish. i can't wait to get started!|`|	check craigslist.. I see complete setups all the time..  Some even come with fish..   (with so many people losing their homes they just want their tanks to be taken care of)|`|	Well....if you're lucky you might be able to score a free one.  IA couple of months ago, in our local Penny Saver that comes out every week, someone was giving away a 150-gal tank with all accessories and stand.  Wish I had something large enough to pick it up in.  Last month there was a 50 tank for free.  There's also usually free items in the want ads in the newspapers.  Check them out first before you spend anything.  I got a free 29 gallon one from someone who knew someone that had it sitting out in their garage and didn't really want it, so word of mouth helps too.  Anyway, you can get a 100 gallon tank, just the tank, where I live for about $100.00 at petsmart and petco .  Don't know where you are, so that might not help.  But then you'd still have $140 to get the filter, heater, and all the goodies for it.  That should be enough for everything you need except a stand.  And actually petsmart had them 20% off this month.  Don't know if it's over now, or if today is the last day, you could call and find out.  I'd really be leary of buying one, used or new from mail order including ebay.  They could break during shipping or could already have leaks b4 you buy it, but that's just my take on that.  Have fun!|`|	Why don't you try to sell yours and get some more money towards a really big tank.  We have got 24 tanks in our house ( as my partner owns his own aquatic shop, and people just give him unwanted tanks and fish etc).  I'm sick of the electric bill.  Or you could get a job in that trade and you never know you might be lucky!!!|`|	i would trade in your tank and get the biggest one possible|`|	i would get the biggest tank i could find for the money would look around lots of them on craigslist.com
IrdZKYT3aa	No, bad idea.  A gold fish will swallow anything they can fit in their mouths, and your danio's are the perfect shape to slurp up.  He may not at first, but the goldfish will grow quickly and the moment he's able to the danio's are lunch.  Also, tropical fish prefer their tanks around 76 degrees, were the goldfish wants it to be around 68 degrees.  One or the other will suffer.  And the ammonia production rom the goldfish will quickly over power the tank, especially as he grows.  They prodce so much waste the water quality will quickly worsen.  I'd stick with tropical community fish.  If you want orange fish I'd try mollies or platy's, maybe some guppies.  Best of luck!|`|2Zb0eNfeaa	Sorry but no. They need very different care from foods to temps to room to grow.|`|F6NZaYyQaa	No your tank is already way overstocked as it is. Plus, goldfish need colder water and at least a 50 gallon.|`|t85b6QMiaa	No honey, I am afraid you have overstocked your aquarium already. Aside the temperature, your red-finned shark and catfish may grow in size and need more space than they initially need.    May I suggest you have a separate tank for your goldfish?|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	No. Goldfish need atleast 20 gallons per fish and they are cold water fish|`|fBYInMlNaa	If your tank was bigger, yes.  Contrary to popular belief, goldfish do well in ow 70's temperatures.
8GDd6lrnaa	look up nearest poultry auctions to you. but why buy if your going to release them, unless their Homing pigeons.|`|AA12325046	Through pigeon magazines or the internet.
xR5xOZ3Saa	yes, i was just at the shelter today and there was this hotot that was really hyper and he loved atention and did funny thing just he scratched when you tried to hold him. i just adopted a dutch and she is cute and calm and does not mind being held shes so cute s    Just go to a shelter and they will let you play with the rabbits and just look for the one you lke    oh and i just got my rabbit and since you already have a rabbit if you would be able to help me with mine its in the other pets section thanks|`|UZZFZ8XYaa	i used to have a netherland dwarf and he was awsome! they are a very good breed. personality is very nice depending if when you get your rabbit its still a baby. i would recomend getting yours when it is still an infant. that way your rabbit is raised to be a kind sweet gentile rabbit
	Golden retrievers don't mature very quickly - so prepare for playful behavior for a few years.  Get him into a string of Obedience classes -- ASAP -- he needs to learn what you want him to do.  Goldens love learning and it will be a mental and physical outlet for his energy!!!    Golden Retrievers are an active, energetic sporting breed.   Daily walks or free exercise are important to their physical and mental health, as well as socialization with other people and animals.  What are you doing for his daily exercise??  You do not mention any activity in terms of how long or how far you are walking him.  You need at least 30 minutes to 1 hour in the morning and another hour at night.  Free roaming is important - so get him to a off-leash dog park!!  Start to teach him to retrieve and buy a Chuck-It - that will give you & him hours of fun in the backyard.    Word of caution -- The Breed Club's website stressed that it is especially important not to force exercise Golden Retriever puppies during their first two years. Avoid jogging, biking, trotting behind a moving car or steep climbs and descents with Golden Retrievers under the age of two.  Bone growth plates are still growing and might be injured during hard exercise.     BUT - Swims, daily walks on soft surfaces, and casual short hikes on flat ground are great exercise for puppies.     The Club website even has a Compatibility Test to see if Goldens would fit in with your lifestyle.    EDIT - I took the test and scored 15 out of a 100.  Oops - good thing I have Dachshunds!  Try the test -- maybe your dog isn't a good fit for you and needs (sadly) to be rehomed.  The Club's site did say that thousands of Goldens are surrendered to Rescue because the families stated -- "they didn't realize how large & active their Golden was going to become"..   :(|`|	A big breed dog like you have will not grow out of the "puppy" stage until he's at least 2 years old.  So you're going to have to do as the previous people advised...exercise, exercise, exercise.  He needs to know the rules and if you haven't started basic obedience now's the time to look into signing him up.  Good Luck!  But remember you make a commitment when you get a pet, find a way to make it work.|`|	Ok, let's not say shoulda-woulda-coulda from the time you brought puppy home.      Let's move forward. At over 8 months old you need a Professional Trainer's advice.  If you do not receive what you need here, contact your Local County Kennel Club - in the phone book. Tell them you wish to contact a reputable trainer or attend classes for an out of control fur kid and ask, "Do they have any recommendations in your area?".    Helpful to read up on the breed, buy a book from Amazon or go to public library for one.    Family member's Golden Retriever, Sammy, gets crazy when he's stuck inside for too long.  Before taking him for a walk the other day I placed a prong collar, walk was so much nicer.  He even sat at the corner of the street when commanded (Doesn't usually happen).  So nice of a walk I even gave him extra lead. Training with a pinch prong collar may be of help to you.|`|	Yeah start exercising him more and sign him up for obedience classes. He needs long walks and other vigorous exercise to burn all his energy off, letting him run around outside is not enough.|`|	Wait does he playfully play with the pomeranians or hurt them? Anywayz golden retrievers r really energetic so maybe u should give it a lot of excercise, dont give the dog away cause ik people who do that which is stupid, u guyz can also train him or just give him more excercise, hope this helps! :D :P There's probably nothin wrong, he's just maybe hyper. Hey wait! Also maybe u can design a playroom just for the golden retriever!|`|	You can get your dog under control with obedience training. He also needs to be exercised, not just let out, at least 2 long walks a day. I have two very high energy terriers that need walking every day.  When the weather permits I have them out walking 2-3 hours every day. Bored dogs are destructive dogs, untrained dogs are impossible to have around. Obedience training and lots of exercise.|`|	My boxer is 2 years old and for a couple months he was really aggressive also. He would bite us and constant growling and barking. We also have 2 cats. he would hurt them. what i do because he isn't ready to walk on the road yet is play with him and chas him around the house...... when we were done he would be so exhausted he would lay down or sit and do his own thing... he  need any Professionale help. I hope this helps :-)
8owlj2xHaa	Start here.http://reefcentral.com/forums/showthread...     You have a lot of reading and researching to do.   They say salt water is a lot more work than fresh water. It is NOT>     What it takes is a lot more KNOWLEDGE. You need to learn more about water chemistry, and how to change , raise levels. You need to learn more about fish care and behavior than with fresh water.   You can not go to a fish store pick out  a pretty saltwater fish and think its going to live. You have to read and research on a fish you might want then go see if you can find it.|`|JvTF7UrMaa	well im only taking a wild guess here but you would need to get the biggest tank possible and place it where you want it and fill with tap water     Prepare enough artificial seawater for the volume needed. Use only a good aquarium sea salt brand and purified water with a Reverse Osmosis or R0/DeIonization Filter. Another option is to fill the tank with RO/DI water and then add the salt. The importance of RO/DI system cannot be understated. Tap water is simply not suitable for reef aquariums. A good RO/DI system is not too expensive, and should be considered a necessity. A 100 gallon per day model is a good choice, because you won't have to wait too long to make purified water which is a nice convenience.   Once you mix your saltwater and fill your aquarium, turn on all your pumps and let the water 'rest' for a day. It takes a little time for your salt to dissolve and your water chemistry to stabilize, and the action of the pumps will drive out excess carbon dioxide (which initially causes a low pH).   Add 'live rock' and arrange to your liking, approximately 20% of your volume. The rock can be placed on an aragonite sand bed but the substrate will tend to accumulate detritus overtime. A sanded depth of 4 to 5" is recommended for maximal detritus biological processing. Live rock can be obtained online or at your local marine aquarium store. The sand bed has to be placed before the seawater is slowly added.   Let the tank "cycle". This means you will need to wait until the water tests negative for ammonia or nitrite. Inserting bits of frozen fish foods in the sand bed can speed the cycle. (This is un-necessary if you added live rock. There are plenty of dead crustaceans and worms already inside due to shipping). This may take 1 to 2 weeks. Algae blooms can be a natural part of the cycle. Check and make sure the salinity is stable at 1.023 to 1.026. Compensate for evaporated water losses with RO/DI water. Keep the temperature, Calcium and Alkalinity levels stable. Do not use commercial "supplements" other than water changes. Algae blooms are common for probably the first 6 months of your aquarium, so don't be alarmed to find new algae growing.   Add cleaning creatures such as snails, small hermit crabs and finally herbivore reef fishes.   Many aquarists feel its not proper to being adding corals until the tank is a few months old. A 'mature' tank is much more suitable for growing coral. A good rule of thumb is to watch your live rock. At some point, you will notice the rock 'growing', and not just green algae. You will seen new crustaceans, worms, feather dusters, coralline algae, and more. When the algae blooms subside, and the live rock is growing nicely, its finally time to add your coral.
AraBfesHaa	Well that sounds AT LEAST like 100 gals, maybe 125, maybe even more.  But WOW that's still an awful lot of fish to be in it to me.  I think it will be overstocked.  Just my opinion.|`|fxH6T7vCaa	No, because regal angelfish are better kept as a mating pair or by itself. its also grows to about 9.5 inches, and needs about a 100 gallon tank, so I hope you have a big tank.|`|AwJXIFDraa	Most likely, except the regal angel fish.. And how big is your tank?

saZINnopaa	Depending on the price range you are able to afford, a Warmblood or Thoroughbred would be best for eventing and show jumping. Other breeds could inclue Draft crosses and Thorougbred crosses. Look for a horse who has some experience in this discipline, since you are only beginning to event. A horse between the ages of 8-14 would probably be best. Here are some websites you could search:  www.dreamhorse.com  www.equine.com  www.warmbloods-for-sale.com  Also, ask your instructor about people he or she may know that have horses for sale. Keep an eye out for advertisements in local newspapers, and check the bulletin board in nearby tack shops.   Good Luck!

QkQruJM1aa	If he bites it's because he WANTS to, and no he is not too young to understand.  Dogs are a lot smarter than people give them credit for, he knows exactly what he is doing.  If that behavior is not corrected very soon it may lead to more unacceptable actions.   I am sure experts will give you other answers but when any of my puppies did that, I bit them right back, on the ear, just enough to make them know I was not happy. After two or three times they never tried it again, to anyone.    Think about it, you are doing exactly what other dogs in his "pack" would to to stop unacceptable behavior, that is his language, he will understand it perfectly. Communicate to a dog in his "language" and he will understand instantly.|`|r9BXyz9zaa	Don't just let it go, it may lead to things like purposely biting to attack.     When your dog bites you make a high pitched yelp, turn around and cross your arms. Ignore any more attempts for him to get you to play. After constant repetition he will get the picture. He'll know "If I bite her, she stops playing and ignores me." so he'll stop biting because he obviously still wants to play.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Don't shake him. This is totally normal and you are just going to have to be patient over the next few months with his teething and chewing. Continue to redirect him. Keep toys EVERYWHERE. Tell him 'ah ah!' and give h im a toy then PRAISE a ton!|`|q0vKbocHaa	when he bites you, yelp, he should've learned from his littermates that a yelp means ouch.   Even though he seems like he isn't learning, he proably is, he's just a baby so it will take awile|`|QWFvw2yvaa	You don't have to yell but you must be stern about this.

Since he's still young, he's still learning so you just need to be patient and consistent. Another thing to do is to very firmly say "no" or give a puppy yelp (because he won't understand "ouch") and then just stop playing with him. Eventually he should get the idea that if he bites, then you're not going to play with him anymore.|`|TGPqMxuaaa	no dog's too young to understand  whenever he bites someone scream really loud at first he'll probably bite again to see if u scream again, but he'll get the point after a while and wont do it anymore|`|DudVFC4yaa	Dogs learn to bite very lightly so it doesn't hurt after a little while. After all they don't have fingers so what else do they have to grip with?  If you are concerned, you can take them to a dog training centre in any town or city and they will soon teach them.  Don't forget, you dog is only playing when he bites and is doing it from love, but dog training groups are always good for the many things they learn there.|`|ALqeqVcsaa	Hi  Sparkling Diamonds i think  there's no a better time to start training your little one i had the same problem i little while ago but since that i'm using this amazing program, http://alflopa415.sitstay.hop.clickbank....

Diet is one of them. When you feed your dog a healthy, nutritious diet, your dog becomes healthier and beautiful.     Good dog foods are foods that do not contain corn, by-products, dyes, etc. To help you find a out what a good and bad food consists of, look here: http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...    Some good dog foods include:   Innova  Blue Buffalo  Taste of the Wild (TOTW)  Merrick  EVO  Orjien  Canidae  Wellness    Some bad foods include:  Ol'roy  Alpo  Iams  Purina ONE  Purina Pro Plan  Science Diet  Beneful  Plus MANY more...    Check this site here for a list of good and bad foods. Try to buy foods that are rated 4, 5, or 6 stars: http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...    Good foods to feed on a budget would be Canidae and Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul    At the moment, I feed my dogs Canidae ALS. It is a pretty good food (rated 5 star) and is priced reasonably well (about $40 for a 35 lb bag where I get it).    Whole raw eggs are also very beneficial to your dogs coat. My dogs get 3 eggs a week, shell and all.    Another option, instead of dry food, is to feed Raw Meat and Bones.    Feeding a dog a raw diet would be biologically appropriate for their species. Dogs, contrary for popular belief, are carnivores, and therefore need to eat meat to thrive (they can SURVIVE without meat, but would certainly not be thriving) and feeding raw meat would be absolutely wonderful.    Dogs immune systems are made different than ours; they can handle A LOT more than we would ever be able to. Plus, dogs digest their food much faster than us humans too (Their digestive systems are made to only digest meat, not plant matter) so bacteria really does not have that much time to settle in.     Here is a wonderful article about bacteria in raw meat:    http://rawfed.com/myths/bacteria.html    If you are cosidering feeding raw as a complete diet there are many things you need to do first.    Before you even THINK of feeding raw, you need to do as much research possible on the subject as to not harm your dog be not feeding it properly, etc. This means reading books, articles, asking around, etc. It means A LOT of work. Feeding raw should not be taken lightly. Many things could go wrong.    Here is a site debunking many of the myths about raw as well as giving you helpful info on the subject:  http://rawfed.com/myths/    More sites on raw feeding:  http://www.rawfeddogs.net/  http://www.4loveofdog.com/benefits.htm  http://www.rawlearning.com/    When done correctly, a raw diet can mean many great thngs for your dog. Just make sure you really look into the subject before jumping into raw feeding!      If you meant stuff like shampoos, etc. I can't really help you there! All I use is some baby shampoo and my dogs are fine.    NemmaLie|`|NCNYmOPCaa	I dunno
5QG9Zrjaaa	Most catteries have "pet quality" cats available, but are often still very expensive and usually have a spay/neuter clause attached to the sale.  I don't have a problem with the "fixing" part, but paying $4K for a purebred cat is just crazy when there are so many in shelters!    I was lucky enough to find a purebred Russian Blue at my local shelter.  I visited the place weekly for 6 months on my lunch hour.  I became friendly with some of the volunteers, and they keep a lookout for the type of cat I wanted.  When I got the call that the right cat was available, I was there ASAP and now have a wonderful companion!  Because she was an adult cat, her adoption fee was waived, and I got her for my chosen donation of $50.  I could have had her for free, but I always donate either food or money when I can.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	You can contact breeders of the particular cat you are looking for. Often times breeders will offer alters or retired breeders at a big discount. Sometimes they will even have older kittens that they will discount.|`|31wmRjtAaa	I have to recommend your local animal shelter......but you may also want to check www.petfinder.com|`|IuYekkPVaa	You could try at your local animal shelter as sometimes purebred cats are put up for adoption.    If you have a particular breed in mind, try searching on-line for a rescue organisation specialising in that breed.|`|4aAhEK9daa	A cat that "resembles the breed"?  Huh?   A cat either is a breed of cat or isn't.  And there aren't dollar stores for "imperfect" cats.    If there's a particular breed of cat that you like the ONLY place to get one is from a reputable breeder.  If the cat is one that doesn't totally fit the breed standard then they sell those cats as "pet quality" cats.  IE, a Japanese Bobtail born with a full tail, a Scottish Fold with ears that aren't folded, a Persian without the breed standard flat face or a crooked nose.  But still - these cats are still that breed of cat and normally sell for at least $500-$700.    Another place you can possibly find a specific breed of cat are shelters.  Not every cat at a shelter is just a domestic - Persians, Siamese, Ragdolls, Maine Coon - people surrender pedigree cats as well.  I have three I adopted from shelters - a Persian, an Exotic Shorthair and a Ragamuffin.  They can't show as those breeds since they don't have papers to "prove" their pedigree but there's no doubt they're those breeds.
t85b6QMiaa	all corydoras variety like nothing better than having fun communicating with other family members.They might not form a shoal but you can see they are enjoying each other company in a community tank. They will create a lively bottom dweller community and the different varieties get on well together.|`|0wZGrwJKaa	Ya, but I'd make sure there are a lot of hiding spots in your tank like different plants and rocks and stuff...that's what we do but we have Cichlids and Corys but the Cichlids and Coreys are in separate tanks|`|2Zb0eNfeaa	Different corys will just ignore each other most of the time. So yes, they'll be fine.|`|cXK9sY1raa	In theory, yes, they should do fine.    Once I had four corys, I bought them in pairs on two occasions. Even though they all got along fine, I noticed that they seemed to like hanging out with the same cory they were put in the tank with, so I had two little twosomes swimming about the tank, it was cute :) I don't think this happens every time though.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	most do|`|D178335Paa	They should. But make sure they are relatively the same size because one fish can pick on another fish. I have a larger female mollie and you can tell she puts the other mollies in their place.|`|aBhW9YVXaa	they get along perfect..but i recommend getting the same exact species in pairs...they like company by their own the most, though when i had 2 julii and one died, i couldn't find any other julii. so, i got 2 peppered and they got along fine.
m0a7Ox1maa	this is such an emotional question.    Leave them there to cope like all the other stray cats that are there    Surrender the kittens to a shelter if they have a shelter there. (look up cat rescue, animal control in the whitepages on the net, or use google)    Or congratulations on your 2 new kittehs! - ring a Vet in the USA (I presume your American) and find out what you need to do to bring the 2 kittens home with you.  I'm guessing some health check and shots would be required as well as some time in Quarantine.    I think with this info and a rough cost you will find your decision easier to make.|`|BFLLJc7eaa	well if  are going to bring them with you, your going to have to get a passport for the cats or something like that. you can always bring them to a shelter in cancun. make sure they dont have ticks or fleas. if you bring them home with you that would be pretty nice =)|`|paaozogGaa	my friends mom brought a stray puppy home when she traveled there  the thing about Mexico is that animals aren't treated very well  If you can find a way to keep them that would be best because they don't really stand a chance there.  did you fly or drive there?|`|GEFTwp2naa	If I were you I would do my best to try and bring them with me. I'm sure that it couldn't be all that hard to bring them. If you're flying, I would call the airport that you're going to be using and ask them what you'd have to do to bring them with you, and I would do that as quickly as possible since you don't have a lot of time on your hands. Now, if you're driving its a little easier, getting a small kennel shouldn't be that hard. Be sure to take breaks every few hours and feed/water them and let them go to the bathroom.    Hope this was helpful.
XK9RLaPeaa	To get him to come to you again you have to only call him to be nice. Never call him and be mad or mean to him when he comes. Even if it takes him a little bit before he comes, praise him when he does. You can also get him to come by running away from him, and making you look fun, so he will come to play with you. While your trying to train him, call him, and when he comes always have a treat for him when he gets there. Do this until he is good at coming, and do it periodically after also, so he never knows when he is going to get a treat. Good Luck!|`|93fc6a0c1267df44dffbfef1bb14f05daa	Many people don't realize this, but older dogs can loose hearing. Vet's can test this. Even younger dogs can be born with deafness, or progressive deafness. You can evaluate him on your own also. Use voices, knocking (he'd feel vibrations), horns, slamming (again vibrations would play a role); if he/she is only reacting to vibrational noises, he probably experienced hearing loss.
9G03aQhsaa	Cats do listen when you talk to them, and I don't see any harm in your dad saying "No"  in a stern "I'm not playing" voice if your cat is harming your other cat, but doing that too harshly or just for hissing is too extreme.  As to not letting you play with her for the rest of the day, that's just wrong.  Your cat will forget the exact reason why she got yelled at after about 10 minutes, and not know why she is being punished after that, though she may associate it with the other cat in some way.  This too harsh punishment could actually be making the problem worse by causing resentment between your two cats.|`|5GKKHbgHaa	He could say no..but not yell at him/her maybe follow up with some discipline..like with my cat we say no...and grab her and give her a "time out" we either put her in her  travel bag for 5 min. or send her to her "room" cats are smart and when they get the pattern they eventually stop..just don't yelll it really does confuse them.|`|AA10797291	No that's not okay. Cat's are very different from dogs or people and are naturally stubborn and just don't understand this 'punishment'. She will probably grow up to be mean if he keeps this up. If he'll leave them alone, the cats will get used to each other. It takes time.|`|IuYekkPVaa	I don't think that your dad is handling things the right way.  When the cats aren't getting on, it's much better to distract them with a loud noise or drop a towel in between them.  By punishing her for a hostile reaction, he's only making her feel even more resentful towards the other cat.    Cats respond best to positive reinforcement, so a better idea would be to try to find ways to help the cats get on with each other.  This article has information and advice on ways that you can improve their relationship.    http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...|`|mxrlZEweaa	No your cat does not understand "leave him alone", all he knows is that is that your dad is yelling at him. Obviously it's not working or your cat wouldn't still be doing it.|`|C1Cobi1taa	thats really harsh. telling her no! is fine but banishing her from human contact is TOTALLY wrong! that is cruel and will not improve her behavior at all! some cats just do not get along! they are teratorial and you can;t force them to get along! tell him it's not right and give your cat the attention she needs!|`|iDxoM3X8aa	you could spray the bully cat with a little water dad is correct to tell her she is bad but not letting you play is not good cats forget a short time after being bad so she will wonder why you dont play with her.the cats will fix things out between them.but dad has to keep order aswell|`|4LuPMBQZaa	No it's absolutely, definitely not okay, your dad is an idiot.  If he doesn't like the cat, tell your dumb father to stay away from him.  He has no right screaming at an animal like that. Cats dont understand!|`|lcaZoa8jaa	you can give them discipline, but its not good to isolate another cat because that will create jealousy problems and issues when they grow up. if you fight flick them gently on the ear and say NO! then they will learn to understand what that means, and maybe after a bit you wont have to flick them on the ear. they dont understand what your trying to do when you just yell at them and isolate them. please take my advice!! talk to your dad about this|`|OfL7FjA0aa	I think that might not be the best idea of disapline, give your dad a spray bottle 4 the cat, the no play rule is horrid and i would tell him that will only make him want more attention (the cat) and he willl attack the other cat again|`|mDuiiVN7aa	He should clap his hands and say (loud): NO, yelling or screaming wont help. All that it will do is confuse and scare the cat.|`|TRkpG3MPaa	He should pop her behind and tell her NO!
XagPxe7Faa	For starters, there is no such thing as a "teacup" Yorkie.  It's a marketing term used by unethical breeders to describe extremely small dogs--something no reputable breeder would purposely try to produce.  It is very disheartening that you have made a commitment to this breed, yet you didn't bother to educate yourself on it, or the proper method for raising a pup at all for that matter, before you got the dogs.    9 weeks is too young for the pups to have been placed with you.  Most reputable breeders agree that pups should not be placed until around 12 weeks of age.  Your dogs will be succeptable to issues with hypoglaucemia--I would recommend educating yourself on the signs of it and how to prevent it.    Yes, you should be feeding them several times per day and monitoring them to make sure they are eating an ample amount.  At this point though, if they have been placed by the breeder, they should be eating solid foodt that shouldn't have to be softened by water.  You say your dog doesn't even have teeth yet!?  At 9 weeks!?  All the more clue that something is wrong and the dog came home too early.  You should continue to feed the dogs whatever they were accustomed to with the breeder while they are still adjusting to their new home, then switch them over to a quality food gradually to avoid digestive upset.    I'm sorry to say, but it sounds as if you were unprepared to take on the responsibility you have chosen AND it seems like your dogs' breeder was dishonest and shady.  Sadly you are having to pay the price for it now.|`|dCcqwVA3aa	You have obviously spent a few bob on these two domesticated rats, so spend some more and take them to a vet for the sake of there health, and while your there get some literature on how to Look after them, people like you amaze me you buy things like this without a clue as to how to Look after the poor wee mites|`|3LAF3XCFaa	I would not add water as it contributes to bloat. Also feeding dry food helps to keep teeth clean, I would feed the same amount with out the water and see where that takes you. Also try feeding a super premium food as it has much more nutrition. Fromm, Evo, Innova, Wellness Core, Before Grain, and Orijen are my favorites.|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	your yorkie might have worms but what ur feeding them is ok but maybe try to do it twice a day instead four tbls in the morning then five in the evening|`|AA10789032	feeding puppies softened dry food at this age is bad for their teeth.   Dogs need the crunchy kibble to help prevent tartar build up.  Whenever you change your pets diet, remember to do it gradually.  Mix some of the new with the old and gradually put less of the old in until you are only feeding the new. How much to feed depends on your dogs weight.  There is a feeding chart on the bags of dry food normally.  If your Westie is active and greedy, you may need to feed him more.  They need to be fed 3-4 meals a day.  Yorkie puppies are prone to hypoglycemia. (low sugar) This can cause them to be less active so make sure she gets enough to eat!  If she looks bloated it could also mean she is a bit wormy.  If your yorkie still acts tired all the time after a week or so you should have her looked at by a vet.
AA10863966	Wow that is great that you are going to your first race, have fun, be safe.  Now as to how to prepare, I can't really say without knowing what you training has been like. once the race starts you can only drive the team you have, it is too late to build speed or endurance. So I would look at what you have been doing in training to get an idea of what you can expect for race performance. As for what place that will be? well it really depends on who else shows up. May I suggest you give yourself a time to beat goal, taking into account your team and what you would like to accomplish. You have control over that, you can't control what other teams may show up. "Sometimes you win, sometimes you loose, but in the end the race is long and you are only in it with yourself" a mantra of mine loosely paraphrased from The Sunscreen Song.    DO NOT get sucked into other peoples races, some folks will go off like cannons, of them some will make it some will crash and burn. Don't get tempted to run a  different race then what you have trained for just cause some other musher is. Getting sucked into other people races is a classic rookie mistake.    Is it a straight 60, or is there  a mandatory rest at a checkpoint? What distances have you trained at. For a 60, I would have done at least a  few 50-70 mile runs, and I would run them the way I wanted to race them. Make sure you have figured out your snack schedule  and type, if you snack every so many hours figure out what a 60 mile should take you timewise and bring at least that many snacks. Actually for a first race I would bring at least one extra set, you might not be being realistic in your estimation of how long this run could take. Unless of course you run that long in training regualrly.     If there is a checkpoint make sure you know what your checkpoint routine is. Ideally practice it when you are out camping with your team. I see so many people waste and loose time wandering around the checkpoint with wasted trips up and down the team trying to get their chores done. Also if you can find out at the mushers meeting what to expect at the checkpoint, will there be hot water, or do you make your own? Is there straw or do you have carry it? Di they have heat or do you have to carry / pack it? What is the procedure for drop bags? when are they due?  when you pack your drop bags think about what you do at a checkpoint and organize your drops for efficiency. What you will use first should be on top of bag 1, and then what you need next below it, and so on.     Related to that, make sure you have tested how you will feed your dogs? if you cook and soak at home that might not be practical  at a checkpoint, figure out what you think you want to do and test it. You don;t want to spring something new on the team during a race. Racing itself will already be new.    Read all the race rules, twice. make sure you know what mandatory gear you have to carry, and make sure you have it all to the letter. No sense in getting time penalties for avoidable mistakes. If you don;t usually camp and carry gear start training with your mandatory gear in the sled. The you can get your system down, you know organize it and see where everything needs to be in the sled so you can use it effectively at checkpoints. And make sure you know how to use all your gear. Especially the cooker!    On a 60 you will most likely be looking at using booties, so if you don't use them in training, start now. Both you and the dogs will need to get used to putting them on. Being able to do it well, with dogs who are used to it can save a lot of time. And even if you are booting during a mandatory rest you still want to be quick, less time booting = more rest for you. If you are not familiar with them you might be able to get a vet to teach you about wrist wraps, algyval, DMSO, and wrist care on the trail.    Some other tips I have learned. When getting ready for the vet check cut the dogs toenails (you should regularly anyhow) doing it them means they are ready for race day, and any nicks will have time to heal. Pack foot ointment in small solo to go cups (like they have for ketchup at fast food places) The smaller size is easier to stick in an inside pocket and keep defrosted.    I don't wash my hair for a few days before, it may sound gross but it makes it mat down better in my ponytail and I don't get those annoying fly-away hairs that freeze to your eyelashes.    You need to stay hydrated and eat, and it makes sense to do that on the run, so learn how to eat and drink on your sled while the team is running. Also test the foods you think you will want at the temps you will be racing in. You would be amazed at how rock solid a Milky Way gets at -20.    Don't overpack, it is a race not a camping trip. I am not saying skimp, please bring everything you need to care for yourself and dogs. But be critical on what extra stuff you bring. For instance, on a 60 I would have extra glove liners and mittens (I have really
IMPvzBk1aa	Please don't start feeding your horse anything like this, especially if there is any reason to believe your horse may have impaired kidney function.  A simple blood test can be performed to determine whether the kidneys are malfunctioning.  None of what you are saying here makes any sense.  Weak kidneys means what?  Kidneys work or they are impaired by disease process or congenital malformation. Your horse should be evaluated by a qualified medical professional, and any treatments should be administered accordingly.  Please call your veterinarian, for your horse's sake and make any decisions on diet and medication based on legitimate diagnosis from a qualified medical professional.|`|ihyM9j8laa	Hi, i think because of her age id really get the vet in just for the once over, my mares TB but is 32 now un had the same problem id say at least the last yr or so, A lady round here does a lot of natural healing she told me to put epsome salt in her water un leave her in a few hours so she gets the water each day. not sure wot the weed is but if you look up health shops maybe its the same thing they give people for cistitis?  just a thought, x|`|mEKsbCw2aa	My horse died of Kidney Failure.

8ohAAwrEaa	I actually suggest a rat.  They are very smart & can be potty trained.     The boys are generally docile & you can take them out without worrying about them trying to get away.

871f0e15f0d49545f27f78f43647edd3aa	If she isn't fixed and is older than 6 months, she might be in heat.  Yes, female cats mark their territory just like males.  And will pee in various places to announce they are sexually receptive.  She could have a bladder infection.   Some cats that have pain when urinating will associate the litterbox with pain and find a comforting place to pee.  Your scent is comforting to her and may help her deal with the pain.  Maybe the other cat chased her from the litterbox and your cat with the problem felt more safe peeing on a blanket that has your scent.  You will need an enzyme cleaner to get rid of the smell.  If the cat pee smell is there, the cats will keep going to pee on the area.  So throw away the blanket, or soak it in an enzyme cleaner for cat urine.  If your cat is straining in the litter box or leaving only half sized dollar amounts of pee in the litterbox, a vet appointment is needed because your cat could have a bladder infection.  If you changed litters, the cat may not like the new litter.  If you missed cleaning the litterbox even for one day, the cat may have decided to use a cleaner area and now that the area smells of pee, it is making a habit of peeing there.  Could it be that when you are gone, the cats get bored and maybe one is chasing the other causing it stress?  Maybe you need to separate them while you are gone so you will know that they will have individual, private time with their litterbox.  Good luck to you and I hope your cat isn't sick.|`|FgyE9Rthaa	It could be behavioral or physical.  First, rule out the physical.  Is her litter box kept clean?  Would you want to use a toilet that wasn't clean?  Cats can be very picky about this, also.  Does she still use the litter box?  If a cat has a Urinary infection, they will go to the litter box and try, but because of the discomfort associated with this, they will not go back to the litter box, and end up peeing on something else.  It could be behavioral as well.  As someone else stated, she may be upset with you for going away and leaving her, and she shows her displeasure by soiling the blanket.  She misses you.  I once had a cat that would get upset if we put him off of our laps, and showed his displeasure by pooping on the rug, even with a clean litter box nearby.|`|0vDLCa24aa	If she's still a kitten then she probably can't hold it in as long as a grown kitten so she'll pee in your blanket cause she wont make it to the litter box in time.|`|oHP2DsfVaa	There could be a couple of reasons for this...  1-the litter box is not up to her standard of cleanliness  2-you mentioned the most recent time was after you were gone for a night...this may be her way of telling you she's pissed off for being gone  3-she may have a problem...sometimes cats will pee where they're not supposed to when they have bladder infections, etc...it's the only way they can "tell" you something is wrong    good luck!|`|zMSdChKgaa	Join the club.

uBFhKXgHaa	Excellent job switching to a high quality wet food! Your cats will be so much healthier for it.    As far as high quality cat food brands.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Darksong~|`|0vDLCa24aa	My cat doesn't like to eat really strong smelling meat. You should try to buy something fishy.|`|4k5NJN29aa	You're right... anything you can get at Walmart will be awful. My personal favorites are Wellness grain-free pouches and Evo (by Innova) canned food. They are available at local specialty pet stores, or online at petfooddirect.com. It's best to mix things up so your cats don't develop addictions. Grain-free is best and works wonders for weight problems.     Additional info:    "These are my top choices of quality canned food for maintenance in cats (for adult cats). Any of them would form a fine basis for your cat's diet, supplemented small snacks of dry food, as needed. The order is based mostly by my own cats' reaction to these foods, and as we know, cats will sometimes turn up their noses today at yesterday's favorite. The bottom line is that the best food is wasted, if your cat won't eat it, so don't be too focused on the numbers.    1. Natural Balance Canned Cat Foods    Like the other foods chosen here, Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance contains no by-products. My cats' favorite formula is Indoor Ultra Formula. Its top named ingredients are Chicken, Chicken Broth, Chicken Liver, Duck, Salmon, Carrots, Brown Rice Flour, and Fish Meal. It has a pleasant aroma, a nice pat consistency, and my test cats dive into it every time it is served.    2. Evanger's Organic Braised Chicken Canned Cat Food    Evanger's Cat Food has been in business since 1935, operates its own (kosher-approved) plant, and claims to use the highest in quality, human-grade ingredients, with no additives, preservatives, artificial colors, by-products or salt.    3. Nature's Logic Canned Cat Food    Nature's Logic claims to have no wheat, corn, rice, soy, potato or chemically synthesized vitamins, minerals, or trace nutrients.    Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken Canned Cat Food    Weruva has long been a favorite among cats who prefer juicy canned food rather than pate. It comes in a number of other varieties, many fish or seafood based.     5. Drs. Foster and Smith Canned Cat Food    My test cats love the flavor of the chicken formula, and I love the aroma, consistency, and quality control.    6. Halo's Spots Stew for Cats - Original Flavor  Spots Stew contains no chemicals, fillers, or by-products.     7. Wellness Chicken Canned Cat Food    Wellness presents an enigma to cat owners who appreciate the quality of the food. Some cats love it and will dive right in, while others turn their noses up at it every time. It's on the high end of the price range, so I'd suggest buying a can or two, before investing in a whole case.    8. Newman's Own Chicken and Brown Rice    Paul Newman's signature cat foods use Bell & Evans Chicken. These chickens are fed a 100% natural all-vegetable diet with NO antibiotics. The named grains are also grown without pesticides or synthetic fertilizer.    9. Evolve Natural Canned Chicken Formula    My cats' reaction to Evolve is also an enigma. The food smells absolutely wonderful, and is a nice, juicy pat. They loved it when I first introduced it to them, but recently have been spurning it - a shame, because its ingredients are excellent, and the price is very reasonable.    10. Innova EVO Canned Cat Food    Innova EVO, made by Natura Pet Products, has to score high on any list of cat foods. The canned variety is no exception."|`|2qVcpkF3aa	I strongly recommend Solid Gold, Wellness and Wellness Core, Innova and Innova Evo, anything that doesn't have grains, meat by-products and no Animal fat.     Science Diet, Iams, Purina, Eukanuba, 9 Lives, Friskies, Fancy Feast, Whiskas...anything at the grocery store or Walmart. It has all the aboves. It's not healthy and are full of grains.     It looks like you did some research, great job!|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Well, in a way that site is an advocacy site against dry kibble.  It is not balanced.  However, if you want to switch, that is up to you.  But it is also up to them whether they will accept the new foods.  The finest food in the world is of no value if they won't eat it, and a cat will starve themselves to death before eating something they don't like.    At 10 months, the kitten can be fed regular adult food.  You will run into lots of problems making sure the older cat does not eat the higher calorie kitten chow.  But that really is up to you if you want to become the 'food police'.    Lets assume your cat eats a mouse.  Everything.  That means organs and bones.  Well, you normally don't eat those organs, nor the bones, so they would be called meat by-products.  And a cat has a short digestive system, so he needs organ meats that are rich in enzymes to digest his food.  And he will eat the bones for the calcium.    Of course, in low quality foods, meat by-products can also mean feathers and beaks, which are really junk.  So in some ways, you do get with you pay for.    As disclosure, my cats eat primarily dry kibble, and have access to not only a water bowl, but also a fountain.  My oldest now is 14 years, and is in fine health.    For brands, I am hesitant to suggest a specific brand.  I stick with brand name foods.  My cats do get a wet food treat once a day.  I got one brand name, and wasn't satisfied with the way the ingredients matched the label.  It was beef, but beef was not the first meat in the list.  So I got another brand name that was beef, and had beef as the first meat.  Well, I was faced with a mutiny.  They preferred, and practically inhaled the first food.    So really, they are the deciders, not you.|`|aP4bkYOCaa	Wellness and Solid Gold make excellent lines of canned food.     http://www.wellnesspetfood.com/  http://www.solidgoldhealth.com/    I whole-heartedly recommend both.

You may need a harness if he's a puller so he doesn't choke himself.|`|VhmBMJKxaa	It sounds like he swallowed something that he shouldn't have. Something that is stuck in his throat. My dog made sounds like that when he swallowed a needle. If we hadn't noticed and taken him to the vet right away, he would have died.     It is probably not that serious, but if it is severe coughing or it last for more than 30 sec. I would take him to the vet to be x rayed, just in case.|`|EgGrKWjxaa	Did he eat any hay?  because thats happening to my friend's dogs too.
QAN5OxWIaa	he still has trouble trusting humans so just show him tht u wont hurt him and reward him every he doesnt growl or show agression to ppl|`|eTsCJYALaa	It sounds like he is being territorial with the dining room. My dog occasionally does this if you go near his dog bed. Basic dominant male behavior, but I would stop it before it becomes more of a problem. You need to take back the room by not letting him in there unless you invite him (if that is possible with the setup of your house). If he growls you need to send him out of the room and keep doing this until he understands that he does not own the area. Good luck!|`|aCqSF87Raa	If you gave him no reason to fear you and he still growls, or has started to for no reason after he's had a period of being "okay", then that is a sign that something is wrong. You need to bring in a behaviorist.    You may personally know not to approach him when he does this, but someone else (namely a child or maybe an adult with no common sense) may and he probably will bite. Even if you don't think he will, act as if he will and get him the help he needs.    Any growl is a cause for concern - he is NOT a moody teenager, or even a human at all. He is a dog. He could be frightened, he could be hurt, he could be anything - and he could bite for any of those reasons OR others. Point is, only a behaviorist would know how to tell and show you how to fix it.|`|rpA9y3Wuaa	Hmm.. I don't know why he would do this. but try coxing him out with treats!   Good luck!|`|GguQknfgaa	This is doggies natural instinct, he must have been scared to death at his old house and had to hide most of his days. When doggie does hide just act like you don't notice her and keep going. Do not try and coax your dog out he is still very cautious and is not quite sure about everything yet. Try training your dog things such as Sit, Lay, Rollover, or you could even set up a little obstacle course for doggie to play on. A trained dog is a happy dog.|`|AA10405438	When he growls, turn him over and be gentle and talk to him.

Well what would you expect the dog has been abused and thinks your going to do the same, its a phobia the best thing you can do is to spend more time with the dog play with him and if he does something bad don't yell or scream just say no but he is not growling because he is mean but because what he has been through...|`|972232cb7b4a4be2255a497cc434cfcfaa	Goo at him in a baby voice and blow him kisses,call his name in a baby voice,too.If he's still growling after that then maybe he has something in his paw like my dog had(same mood).Or you just need to treat him like gold and even if he does growl don't yell  at him,etc. Good luck. :)|`|X4nGf5Pwaa	The dog could have been abused 10 years ago, however, he may remain traumatized! A dog is like a child, that memory will stay with him, and his animal instinct will come out no matter how close you are to him! If I was in your position, every time you walk in and hes acting like that, I would grab a treat, walk over to him, give him the treat and pet him. He'll know that you love him. He may continue to act like that but make sure he knows that you love him.     Good luck! I hope I helped!    And for the toys thing... Dont worry thats perfectly normal!
AA11955868	I'd really stick with the cat tree. It's simple, it gives the cats something to scratch other than my real furniture. They are ugly, it's a big stick of carpet, but, eh, you have cats. People get that.     I'm not really sure how cat furniture gets an editor's choice award unless the editor was a cat.    Of course, 8 times out of 10 whatever you buy your cat will go unused. They prefer to sit on your papers when you're writing, or on your face just as you were getting up. That's kind of their thing.     That being said my cats do use the cat pole I've got, mostly to chase each other around on, but no one uses the little house at the base. But maybe your cats know what's going on and get excited about the prospect of a fine wooden structure : )|`|xyPpruSjaa	Stop asking the same questions over and over again!

3n60UxgQaa	While it's probably okay, most bottled waters are inferior to tap water.    Tap water contains lots of minerals that are beneficial to the fish.  Most bottled waters don't have this.  The only downside to the tap water is that it contains chlorine and chloramines that are harmful to fish, which is why the conditioner/dechlorinator is necessary.    I recommend using the tap water. =]|`|cXK9sY1raa	It's not a great idea.

I would set water out over night in a bucket or two add the conditioner and then add it to your tank with the fish. This way your not risking the minerals without knowing the reaction. When i last used bottle water i bought a jug of it at the local store.
PM23RDycaa	Yes you were ripped off. She didn't tell you because she knew you wouldn't take the puppy. Classic BYB tactic. You should have gone and SEEN the pug before you handed over ANY sort of money and also asked if there was a health guarantee. This is why we tell me to ask TONS of questions before asking, get a health guarantee and generally do plenty of research BEFORE purchasing from a breeder.    More than likely the hip problems are genetic as well. Here is the Pug health index from the breed club so you know what else to be on the look out for. http://www.pugs.org/indexhealth.htm|`|r9BXyz9zaa	You should never buy from a breeder, because making 100% pugs limits the genes in the gene pool, causing deformities. I  think You should talk with a lawyer, but don't bring the urine thing to court if you'resuingg the breeder, (which is the real person who isresponsiblee)    Also, did you see the actual place the dogs came from? You may be looking at some one who is in charge of a dirty puppy mill. This case seems very suspicious to me, you may want to report it to your animal ccruelty officer.|`|maeGnrRjaa	these are the sorts of things you need to ask about before you get a dog. It's your responsibility to check out the breeder before you buy it. Don't just assume that they are going to be upfront about everything.

We adopted from a rescue & actually paid a bit more than from a pet store but he's awesome & we received some freebies & advice that made the slight extra cost well worth it-- also when you adopt from a rescue, part of the fee goes to help other animals. Our guinea pig *loves* to be held & is uber-cuddly.

They do take awhile to get used to you, so you need to hold them and pet them a lot. They are very skittish and like to run away, so just be patient. Also to help them get used to you feed them veggies with your hand.|`|yoaWcfGvaa	Guinea pigs range in price from $5 each (usually for a pet quality directly from a breeder) to $20 or $30 each (from a pet store).    A good cage will be $30 to $40 for a good quality cage from a pet store.    They are generally very friendly.  I used to work at a day care and would take guineas in for a day.  The kids loved them and could handle them easily.  The guineas I took were not shy - I've had some that would be uncomfortable in a situation with lots of kids.  It really depends on the temperament of your guineas, but for the most part they will be friendly and enjoy your company.

d2Obe0aJaa	Let me break this down. As far as the flying lead change goes it shouldn't take that long. I'm assuming that your going to be doing reining. When I would do is circle the arena on a lead and then cut across the middle break the horse to a trot for 4 steps and then pick up the other lead. After the horse understands it then I would lessen the trot steps and thats a quick run through of how you do a flying lead change.  For the sliding stop there some things that you need to realize. The NRHA horses that do the sliding stop that goes a couple of feet they wear special shoes, also I know a couple of reining people who put butter on their horses sliders (shoes) to achieve a farther slide. When you first want to teach a horse a sliding stop, you want a horse to be alert, being able to stop on a dime. So you'll begin by asking the horse to walk around and then stop. You will want the horse to be expecting a stop. Then I'd ask for a trot, trot randomly around the arena, ask for the horse to stop. Keep in mind you will want to say "whoa" this will make the training for the stop easier. You want the horse to stop on a dime, then you can work up to a canter. Pretty much its the same as the walk and trot.   When doing a reining pattern for the sliding stop you want the horse to speed up right before the sliding stop. With the momentium of the horse speeding up this will help the slide.  hope this helped|`|an1L8njXaa	Personaly i do not like using poles to teach a horse to change, i find it tends to make the horse change late behind.  I use simple changes to teach a horse, so when a horse is balanced and going well i will do a canter to walk transition do a set amount of walk strides and then ask for a walk to canter transition on the other lead. I will then reduce the number of strides of walk until i can remove them entirely. it can also be done through trot instead of walk if your walk to canter or canter to walk transitions are not too solid however i wont teach my horses flying changes or anything more advanced untill the basics are well established and that includes direct transitions. If you dont establish the basics then you are just asking for problems further down the line

I think you can solve your rabbit issue with around $55. If you already have a pot then for $5 you could be having a really nice rabbit stew.    Hey presto.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	You can get a bunny for free or for as much as $100+!  I would expect to pay about $20 for a bunny, more than that is probably too much.  Look at breeders, they sell really expensive rabbits, but the pet quality rabbits that aren't "good enough" for the shows, are usually really cheap. I got my Holland for free.    A good cage bought at a pet store is really expensive, you will be paying close to $100, maybe more.  It is cheaper to build one.  I built a really great cage for less than $50 and it only takes an afternoon.    A bag of pellets costs between $15 and $25 depending on the quality, and you should only need a new bag every few months.  Timothy hay is around $10 a bag, but you will need new hay every few weeks.  Likewise with paper litter.    The most expensive part of a bunny is getting it fixed.  Because they are considered exotics, most vets that are good with cats and dogs don't know as much about rabbits.  There are fewer vets who can operate on bunnies and it can be really expensive, how expensive depends on where you live.  In most places, you can expect to pay around $100.    Most humane societies will adopt a bun to you already fixed.  The one in my area charges $40 for a rabbit and that includes the spay/neuter.|`|h4HL3d3uaa	probably 599 dollars plus tax|`|IgzotplRaa	YES!!!!!I have I have a bunny and he is super!!!!!! playful and crazy.|`|5cDVQED5aa	i had a bunny and i let my cousin look afeter it for me for two weeks and it ended up dead, i was gutted but dont really no the cause of it i think it might have been due to the stress of movin but he also has teeth problems through out his short life, he was only 18 months when he dead i consider this to b very young. so in my experience i wouldnt suggest moving it around. i paid 26.00 for rabbit 150.00 for cage but it was a really cool one there are cheaper one like 50.00 then u have to by the food and water bottle and hay and bedding and toys. so going on the price of a cheaper one i would ay u r lookin at about 130/150 also they can b vet bills on top. my bunny was always ill and i spent 400.00 on him keep taking him to the vets and having to have his teth clipped poor thing, but hopefully u will have a healthy one. make sure u get a book on bunnies before u by one as it can tell u the signs of a ill bunny unfortunatly i dint do this and look what happened to me,, mine was also a dwarf lop but he certainly was not small he was huge. so i wouldnt by from a pet store i would seek out a good breeder where u no the animl has been properly cared for and not taken away from its mother to early so it has been weaned properly!!|`|5I7MZjHuaa	Please take a look at   http://www.rabbit.org/  to see if a rabbit is really for you.

6JE0mcrLaa	Well, you never mentioned how long you've been riding, and whether or not you are capable of taking care of a horse. It's not necessarily how old you are, but your ability to care for a horse. 15 is a great age to get a horse as long as you have experience. For the horse... 9 is an okay age. For your first horse, it is best to get an older horse who is very forgiving. If you've been riding for 5+ years, then it's okay to get a younger horse, but it all depends.        25 minutes is fine if your parents are willing to take you there every day.|`|xLNzdxsOaa	I have no problem with older horses; my 21 year old arab can still do pretty much everything.

How much experience do you have?    You must consider all of the expenses when buying a horse. To be honest it's not an easy question to answer as I say it does depend on what experience you have and if this horse is suitable for you. 8 years old - nearly 9 is a good age but it depends on the horse just because it is nearly 9 doesn't mean it will be quiet, etc.|`|44de18facbbb84a65b0b415f318f53adaa	8 is a really good age.

So yeah, 8 is great.|`|b674gfUmaa	id say 8 is a good age 4 u!    but id reconsider the whole buying a horse now thing because boarding, hay, and owning horses are very expensive now days.    but that is up to you

GOOD  LUCK!!!|`|r9BXyz9zaa	I'm happy you're wiling to adopt because There are plenty of worthy dogs out there who don't get dopted because someone would rather get dogs from a breeder.  Try a local shelter or rescue like this one:http://www.anticruelty.org/site/epage/35...  Ask the m you want a Shiba inu, they will tell you if they have one. Or, go to petfinder.com and type in the breed and area you want to find the dog in.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Go for adoption _ I did.  I adopted a 4yr male shiba last year but I have lot, lots of dog experience & was prepared to handle him.

AA10027242	My cat had persistent diarrhea after getting her teeth cleaned.  It lasted over a month and a half, and we couldn't get it to stop.  Prednisone pills finally worked.  It turns out her intestines were inflamed because of the stress of the tooth cleaning.  Also, try another vet who won't give up so easily.  That's not cool|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	** First......be VERY CAREFUL if you try to give Pepto Bismul to a cat.  It has analgesics in it and they're TOXIC to cats!! **    Now........Your vet sounds like a nut case.  Diarrhea can be cured if the right treatment is used.  Did the vet do a fecal test ... for worms / parasites?    What kind of food are you feeding him? Are you giving him canned meat?  Is he drinking cow's milk?  Cow's milk will cause diarrhea, but GOAT milk won't.  Maybe, you can try some Goat milk.  ASK about the Acidopholus milk...I understand it's supposed to be good for "people" who can't digest cow's milk.  Maybe a ( new?? ) vet will know if this might work for cats.    I give my cats Purina One Sensitive Systems and they seem to do very well on that.  Have you tried it?  It's DRY food.  There's so much water in canned food, that he may be having a reaction to that.  Try just dry for awhile, and see if that helps.    Meantime, you may want to get some Pedialyte to give him.....to raise his electrolyte level, since diarrhea dehydrates an animal ( human, too ) so quickly.    Hope this helps........If not, try a DIFFERENT VET........  Good luck......Hope he gets better soon......|`|xoJnDBxsaa	Try some human Pepto-Bismol, but just a little bit. I hope this works for your cat, it worked for mine. Good Luck and good for you for taking a stray.
CkecSp4Uaa	Hire a trainer and learn how to train your dog.  Most likely your dog is very poorly socialized, most pet store mutts are (she might also have a poor temperament or mental issues due to her poor breeding to boot).  And quite frankly, leaning in like that or getting in her face is quite rude of you in terms of canine body language (which is the language that SHE understands).  You are right to be concerned because if you keep ignoring her warning signals like this she's going to feel that she has no choice to bite you since growling and bearing her teeth failed to get the message across.  You need to bring in someone who understands dogs to teach you how to communicate what is and is not appropriate behavior.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Why would you "lean in" and try and kiss her when she is going to sleep? She is a dog not a human? She is obviously not happy with your close proximity.     Watch the Dog Whisperer programmes on TV if you get chance, he's great really, we learned a lot. Its mostly us humans that are at fault, not the dogs.|`|oVwGit7qaa	I don't have one, but I think I may be able to help. Your dog just may not like you getting to close. It also could be, as you said, a "please don't disturb me" growl. Just try not to get to close to her while she is trying to rest. I would also keep your face away in case she decides to bite. Sorry i am not much help. Good luck|`|ZOmv6sUVaa	Well i have no idea how to stop it, but my dog is the same way! He only likes my dad and hates the rest of us! At night he likes everyone, but in the morning when we go off to go to school, he goes crazy and growls and tries to kill us...I AM SCARED.....HOPE I HELP! what i do is when he growls or bites....we get a spray bottle...and put it to "stream" and whenever he tries....we spray a little water in his face....it calms him down but every morning it still happens!!|`|iDxoM3X8aa	this could be a problem try taking her to dog classes/you could try hitting her bottom with a paper when she is grumpy you should keep you,re face out off her way incase she bites

FewhKlx9aa	I own an all black sheperd and yes the hair is always shedding year round..I found that the Furminator at your local pet store and d/n get a generic one as they don't work works really well.You will not believe the amount of hair you can get out of your dog with this..It will be the last brush you buy..But I find I do it less often as the undercoat with this brush comes out more easily to keep the shedding down|`|Bw18seFqaa	all dogs with hair shed.    German shepherds have a double coat. so they shed alot.    There's nothing that will stop shedding.. its part of the natural hair cycle.      You can reduce and minimize shedding.. or controll it...  a good diet is the first start.  Also daily brushing will remove the dead hair from her coat, and stimulate healthy skin and coat.    Give her a good conditioning bath to loosen the hair..   now use an undercoat rake..  with one hand brush the coat backwards to expose the under coat.. use your other hand to brush the undercoat to remove the hair.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Welcome to owning a German SHephard, they are heavy shedders. Make sure the diet includes lots of Omega 3& 6's, supplement with fish oil capsules which will certainly help, but not eliminate the shedding.|`|wJhZbUKtaa	nope but I also have a shepard. I use a shedding shampoo on her brush allot and often!|`|sYMKBW25aa	We use a Furminator on our shepard.

rYOk7nM0aa	It's really difficult to predict what a kitten is going to be like based only on his breed. I would say almost all kittens for the first few months up to the first few years are going to be extremely rambunctious. They're going to run all over the house and make a mess of everything you leave laying around. I've had a lot of kittens in my life and I can tell you that some of them would scratch couches and climb the curtains, others would be content to just chase their toys around the house. Kittens in general aren't what I would consider "aggressive" but it takes them awhile to learn that their teeth and claws can really hurt! They think they're just playing but if they play too hard, they can do damage. You've got to be patient and gentle with him at all times and make sure he gets lots of exercise. Get lots of toys that he can play with and make sure he gets lots of contact with people so he will be properly socialized.

ASAP.    Roundworms.  Several of these parasites affect dogs but the most important are the ones that belong to the Ascarid family, and live in the small intestine. Other roundworms infest the large intestine, blood vessels and respiratory tract.   Ascarids feed on digesting food in the dog's gut, and are particularly harmful to puppies. They penetrate a puppies gut wall and pass via the blood to the liver and then to the lungs. From there they crawl up the trachea to be coughed up and swallowed, again ending up in the gut. Infected puppies may develop :-    Hepatitis, pneumonia, fits, and obstruction to the gut, so regular treatment is vital.    As the puppy gets older most of the worms travel to the muscles, where they form cysts. These lie dormant until the puppy ***** becomes pregnant. They then migrate to the puppies lungs, and this is why virtually every puppy is born with roundworm, and must be wormed regularly.    How Roundworms Affect Humans.  These worms can infect humans, and in a very low number of cases, cause disease. Good hygiene and common sense concerning children and puppies should control the problem.    Tapeworms.  The tapeworm tickle the dog's anus and make the dog drag it's rear end along the floor. If you see any worm segments in your dog's feces, treat it as soon as possible.    As a dog lover myself, I treat my own pets at least twice a year. Worming tablets can be bought cheaply at your local supermarket or pet shop, so there's no excuse for not treating your own pet on a regular basis.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	if they are round like spaghetti, then they are round worms.  if the are flat and segmented they are tape worms.  either way you need to see your vet for appropriate medication.|`|axGprtU1aa	DO NOT use over the counter dewormer.

You can often see tapeworms (or segments of them) in your puppy's feces. They look like small grains of rice and are white in color.  Roundworms are another common kind of puppy worm and many puppies are born with them from an infected mother. They can sometimes be seen in your puppy's feces.  Have your vet do a stool check so they can be treated.

On second thought since the horse market is overburdened with horses go ahead.|`|AA10986942	WOW!  When you horse people learn....THERE IS NO HORSE SLAUGHTER IN THE US ANY MORE!!!!  It has been outlawed here and because of that many many horses are dying slow painful deaths when they are just abandoned since they can no longer be taken to sale barns to be sold for slaughter.  Would you rather a horse go through a few days going to the sale barn then being transported to the slaughter house and killed or how about just being abandoned in a field or barn and left to starve or freeze to death... nice and slow maybe several months?????  Yes, slaughter is not pretty, but do you eat beef???  they die the same way!  once the horse is dead it is no longer suffering so all of these pictures of horses in the slaughter house are already DEAD and they no longer feel pain but you feel sorry for them because they look gross....  too bad for you at least they are out of their misery.  Most of the pictures you see of these horses are only to get your sympathy, dont feel sorry for them once they are dead, they feel no pain.  Only be concerned about what they went through while they were alive, I agree some go through some pretty rough treatment enroute to the slaughter house but like I said a few days is better than months and months.....|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Go to a horse auction, and save a horse.  Slaughter is a horrible experience, and kootos for you for wanting to save a horse.  I was at an auction once with my mom, and there was this gorgeous draft with great conformation (extremely thin, but you put weight on, and it would be fine, most likely) and nobody was buying it.  I kept poking my mom and telling her to bid- i mean, a 50 dollar horse?  Come on!  Saving money and a horse!  She said no, and the horse... well, went to slaughter.  I still havn't forgiven myself.  I should've just put my hand up.

Good luck and God bless you and your horse! :)|`|A3g0rrTXaa	I would suggest adopting from an established organization that rescues horses then trains them. That cuts out your risk of getting into a really bad situation with a horse and you're still saving a horse. By adopting from a rescue you are allowing space for another horse to be brought in.     Quote from fuglyhorse of the day: She makes a really valid point:  "Adopt an animal that has been cooling its heels at a rescue for a while now, waiting patiently for a home and being overlooked because it is not in immediate jeopardy.    I always hear complaints that nobody wants to help an animal if there is no euthanasia/slaughter threat pending, and you know what? That's a valid complaint. There are way too many people who only step up to help or adopt when they can say they "saved a life." Well, for heaven's sake, you save a life every time you adopt, because you clear up space for the next one."    Some places to adopt from:  http://www.canterusa.org/  http://www.lastchancecorral.org/  http://www.lopetx.org/  http://www.midatlantichorserescue.org/  http://www.rerun.org/  http://www.saddlebredrescue.com/  http://www.safehorses.org/  http://www.secondchanceranch.org/  http://serenityequinerescue.com/default....  more below...    Some of these rescues are not near you but you can always contact them and get recommendations for rescues in your area. These rescues are a safe way to save a horse from slaughter, abuse and neglect.|`|dg2tuNZCaa	ok, well you could go to a local auction. i no this is far away but there are mustangs for sale by the BLM in nevada and other places out west. although, u would need to be pretty experienced.|`|pShlJVvraa	sale barns|`|mzgEgG57aa	Try a newspaper,  there are ads everywhere that say "Sell or glue factory"  which I'm sure nobody would do,  but right now the horse market is so bad that people are giving their horses away everywhere.|`|qXvFsnOcaa	Horses are rarely slaughtered these days unless they are very sick or badly hurt. your best bet would be to find an animal shelter that was about to go under who have a rescue horse that they can no longer afford to feed.|`|OmpRTBqdaa	You could look in the newspaper or you can go to auctions    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH4cppnHd...

But you have to watch the whole thing.|`|rpA9y3Wuaa	everywhere!|`|RoPLmd2daa	Auctions would be my first stop- then you're more directly "saving" the horse from slaughter.|`|q5wKgjacaa	call PETA.|`|3bzaDhReaa	Most any horse that goes through an auction ends up going for slaughter in Canada as well as in the U.S.   Good well trained horses are being butchered because no one wants them.  In 2008 in Canada, 112,887 horses were slaughtered for export.  This is a 42% increase over 2007 and a 125% increase over 2006.  The numbers have doubled since the 3 U.S. plants closed.  The U.S. horses are coming to Canada or being sent to Mexico which ever is closer.  Please save a horse from slaughter.  Google horse rescues in your area and watch the sale ads in your local paper.    Good luck.|`|qIChGhooaa	You could try your local animal shelter. Look online at equine.com or other places like that.

I just adopted a Appaloosas, he is a strawberry roan, a great horse..|`|AA11096223	I know this is a controversial subject, but here is some info from a person with experience.  Unfortunately, most horses bound for slaughter ended up there for a reason.  For problems either physical or behavioral, they are unsuitable for riding.  The high cost of caring for a horse makes it nearly impossible to keep them.  I will admit there are a few exceptions, and some horses in the line are perfectly good, but chances are slim of finding a good horse in that bunch.      My suggestion is to check into a local rescue group.  They already have horses needing homes, and most often can help you select a horse that will be a good match for you.

Ei85kgfdaa	Why do you want to breed her? what has proven her quality to reproduce?    Please spay your female and adopt another dog if you want a second.|`|PM23RDycaa	Find a breed mentor in the shih tzu club and work on making her a champion. Of course by the time you  know enough to breed her safely she will be 4 years of age. Do you have the time and money to devote to breeding and showing her properly?    She needs genetic clearances. You have to find a proper stud and then work out if the owners get stud fee (the cost of a pup) or pick of the litter. Small dogs often need c-sections so you have to put money aside from that. You'll also have to devote to weeks from work to her the week she is due and the first week of the pups lives to make sure nothing goes wrong    don't breed if you aren't going to do it right.    You should only be breeding show quality dogs not just any old pet quality animal with god knows what faults.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	You mean you didn't get business cards at the Dog shows when your dog won Best in Shows?

You should do the responsible thing and get your dog spayed.|`|aCqSF87Raa	You wouldn't just be waiting until her next heat, you would be waiting until whatever heat cycle comes after the male dog turns two. You DO want to produce healthy puppies, right? Because two is the minimum age at which you can have genetic testing done - and all breeding stock must have this done.    And by then she would be a little too old for her first litter!    Either way you risk her death by breeding without the guidance of a breeding mentor. Small dogs have higher death rates because even the slightest size difference in the male dog could mean that the pups are too big for her to carry and whelp.    Unless your dogs are Ch quality (IE have proven to be good examples of their breed as chosen by an impartial judge) or have been worked and proven in something else, they really shouldn't be bred.     Only about 10% of all dogs are breeding quality (IE healthy, free of genetic disease, etc) and you would be in touch with THAT dog's breeder if you were truly interested in responsible breeding.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Vets do not always know what they are talking about.  A dog should never be bred before she's 2 years old, genetic health tests cannot be done until 24 months...   but a first litter should be before she's 4-5 years old.  However the more heat cycles she has, the higher her chance of cancers and pyometria..  a litter does also increase the odds of cancer.  Breeding is NEVER safe!    you first need to show her and proove that she's a good example of her breed..   she also needs genetic health tests done thru the OFA, CERF, BAER and Optigen, as well as a brucellosis test to proove that she does not have genetic disease to pass down.    You also need a breed mentor, which you meet thru the show ring...  you need to research breeding, pedigrees, genetics, whelping, puppy raising, etc.. your mentor can help you with this.    You need to save money for prenatal care.. small dogs often need cecarians.. you should have at least $3,000-5,000 saved up for possible emergency care.    Any male you select should also be shown and tested as well..  your mentor can help you select the best mate..  not likely the male you buy will be the best choice..  the stud should have traits that compliment your female's faults, and vice versa.|`|FjupHjn5aa	you don't have to wait but i would if shes a mixed dog you should if shes not go right ahead|`|3LAF3XCFaa	I would just get her spayed!|`|746YLjISaa	You can wait till her fourth heat but instead of wasting money on your own shitzu male just find a high quality stud and breed her with him.|`|ixFbNr4taa	You obviously don't know any thing about breeding -- So DON'T!!  Shih Tzus have a high rate of  Caesareans.  Also they have several genetic conditions including hare lips and/or cleft palates.  Are you willing to breed knowing the risks??    Here is the answer from your Breed club's own website.........    Know the Facts Before Breeding Your Dog       We (The American Shih Tzu Club) think it is extremely important to learn the facts and possible consequences in advance if you are contemplating breeding your dog. In todays overcrowded world, we, the wardens of our domestic pets, must make responsible decisions for them and for ourselves.     QUALITY: AKC registration is not an indication of quality. Most dogs, even purebred, should not be bred. Many dogs, though wonderful pets, have defects of structure, personality or health that should not be perpetuated. Breeding animals should be proven free of these defects before starting on a reproductive career. Breeding should only be done with the goal of improvement-an honest attempt to create puppies better than their parents. Ignorance is no excuse-once you have created a life, you cant take it back, even if blind, crippled or a canine psychopath!    COST: Dog breeding is not a money-making proposition, if done correctly. Health care and shots, diagnosis of problems and proof of quality, extra food, facilities, stud fees, advertising, etc. are all costly and must be paid before the pups can be sold. An unexpected Caesarean or emergency intensive care for a sick pup will make a break-even litter become a big liability. And this is IF you can sell the pups. If you are breeding to get another Shih Tzu just like your own, her puppies may be nothing like her, and it would probably be cheaper to simply purchase another puppy that has the qualities you want from a reputable breeder. Even better, consider adopting a rescue Shih Tzu that might otherwise not find a new home.    SALES: First-time breeders have no reputation and no referrals to help them find buyers. Previous promises of "I want a dog just like yours" evaporate. Consider the time and expenses of caring for pups that may not sell until they are four months old, eight months old or more! What would you do if your pups did not sell? Send them to the pound? Dump them in the country? Sell them cheap to a dog broker who may resell them to labs or other unsavory buyers? Veteran breeders with good reputations often dont consider a breeding unless they have cash deposits in advance for an average-sized litter.     JOY OF BIRTH: If youre doing it for the childrens education, remember the whelping may be at 3 a.m. or at the vets on the surgery table (particularly when were speaking of Shih Tzu, small dogs trying to whelp large-headed puppies). Even if the kiddies are present, they may get a chance to see the birth of a monster or a mummy, or watch the ***** scream and bite you as you attempt to deliver a pup that is half out and too large. Some bitches are not natural mothers and either ignore or savage their whelps. A confused Shih Tzu mother with her first litter may "lose" one very young puppy behind her and unknowingly smother it while caring for the other pups. Bitches can have severe delivery problems or even die in whelp-pups can be born dead or with gross deformities that require euthanasia. (Hare lips and/or cleft palates, which are not uncommon in Shih Tzu, result in puppies that cannot nurse and cry incessantly, upsetting their mothers, before they starve to death if you are unwilling to have them euthanized.) Of course there can be joy, but if you cant deal with the possibility of tragedy, dont start.    TIME: Veteran breeders of quality dogs state they spend well over 130 hours of labor in raising an average litter. That is over two hours per day, every day! The ***** cannot be left alone while whelping and only for short periods for the first few days after. Be prepared for days off work and sleepless nights. Even after delivery, mom needs care and feeding, puppies need daily checking, weighing, and socialization. Later, grooming and training, and the whelping box needs lots of cleaning. More hours are spent doing paperwork, pedigrees and interviewing buyers. If you have any abnormal conditions, such as sick puppies or a ***** who cant or wont care for her babes, count on double the time. (Young Shih Tzu puppies need to be hand-fed every two hours around the clock if they are not getting food from their mother!) If you cant provide the time, you will either have dead pups or poor ones that are bad tempered, antisocial, dirty and/or sickly-hardly a buyers delight.     HUMANE RESPONSIBILITIES: Its midnight-do you know where your puppies are? There are 3.5 million unwanted dogs put to death in pounds in this country each year, with millions more dying homeless and unwanted through starvation, disease, automobiles, abuse, etc. Nearly a quarter of the victims of this unspeakable tragedy are pure
65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	You need to find a friend or someone to take them.  My husband and I have adopted a Pit bull from our friend that went into the marines.  When ever our friend is on leave he comes and spends time with his old buddy.     I sure you could find someone to foster them while your gone. I think there is a group that does just that Take in dogs for men in the armed forces.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	How long will you be deployed? I can understand you not wanting to get rid of them.  Do you know anyone who would be willing to take the dogs in while you are away? That would probably be more ideal if you  can do it that way.  Living in a kennel setting can be quite difficult on some dogs even more if its going to be for months assuming you will be deployed for at least 3 months if not longer. I would defiantly look into these pet foster programs for military personal who are deployed. If you can get something like that it would be much better for your dogs then for them to be boarded for months.|`|eTsCJYALaa	There are specific dog foster groups that will take in military personnel's dogs so they will be  there when they return. Google "dog foster homes for deployed soldier" and you should get a few sites. Good luck and thank you for your service to our country.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	you should research pet sitters in your area.  if not call local Vets and they should offer boarding for your pups.  The Vet boarding won't offer as much of a personal touch and depending on how long you are gone could really be hard on your babies.  But you can check with your vet and they may actually have pet sitters they trust to watch your dogs that they can refer you to.  There are also facilities that board animals and will do things like spend one-on-one time with your pets and let them play out in a fenced area with other dogs. Just check into it ASAP so your pups will be well taken care of while you're gone and so you won't have to worry.  Having a pit mix shouldn't be a concern as long as your's has a good disposition.  I have one that's a BIG BABY!!
IrdZKYT3aa	I work in a pet store were one tank has a few small bichir living with some small dragon goby's and young black knifes.  When I toss flakes in they are the only ones to go for them!  However, I feed the black knife's blood worms and brine shrimp that the Bichir love to gobble as well.  I'd make sure they come up for the flakes, and maybe supplement some blood worms every once in a while.  All you fish will love those as a treat.  Best of Luck!|`|fxH6T7vCaa	They love krill and freeze dried night crawlers or something would be good too.|`|t85b6QMiaa	I have been keeping African Bircher "Erpetoichthys ornatipinnis" for some year now. Although he seem to accept flakes and other dry foods,  he much prefer having live foods as his diet. Sadly, I made a foolish mistake by mixing this guy with my Betta splendens when I first bought it.      For you have two specimen, it'll take time before they form each territory and will start waging war among themselves. And it's natural for them to hide even though you keep it as solitary specimen. Bircher is not a strong swimmer species. They do best in laying quietly, waiting for their prey. They might be eyeing for your angel fishes or the kissing fishes if they are not too large.

My GSD was diagnosed with arthritis in her knees, she suffered from internal bleeding when she was prescribed Metacam, this was apparent when her stools became almost black. I investigated other meds on the internet and discovered Flexadin. Its about 70 from the vets and 20 on the internet.  It contains Glucosamine and Chondroitin which help enormously with pain and bone problems; however it also contains Devils Claw which also helps with pain. Later I accidentally discovered that Seraquin has other virtues because as well as the above stuff it also contains Turmeric, this is about 60 from the vets and 16 on the internet. My ten  year old is now chasing rabbits and she appears to be pain free. Seraquin is chicken flavoured and I just add this to her food.|`|r9BXyz9zaa	Well there's a product called 'pill pockets' that work well, they're treats that completely cover the pill.  Also train your dog that when you open it's moth you will put a treat in. Then it won't reject the pill when you open its mouth because its expecting a treat. a nice way to make sure they swallow it is they usually lick their chops after swallowing.|`|vPde97E2aa	Open mouth...SHOVE pill in...HOLD mouth shut until it swallows.  TA-DAH|`|m81dfyOYaa	I don't know what you're giving for arthritis but I use K-9 liquid health (glucosamine/hondroitin/msm) for one of my terriers.

He had is sussed in days and like you ate round it, again I did everything that you did.     Eventually I had to have a stand-off, it was tough but I was TOP DOG and was going to stay that way.   I crushed them up and sprinkled them in the morning food but so well mixed he couldn't pick it out, when he didn't eat the food. I took it away 10 minutes later, he stood a further 20 minutes pacing and scratching.  At lunch I put the same bowl down again, he did the same.  At tea I did the same, he ate 2 small mouthfuls. I took the bowl away again.  At supper he got the same bowl, he finished it.He then got a treat.    From that day he knew that if he finished it all in the morning bowl he didn't get it again that day.....    Don't give in so quickly, just keep taking that bowl away.  She's just getting the better of you.     Yorkies are smart, you just got to be smarter top dog !|`|6cEwF2Vraa	You might just have to open her mouth and with one finger (very quickly) tap the tablet in the back of her throat. Immediately close her muzzle and rub her throat until she swallows. You can then give her a little piece of cheese, peanut butter or what have you for a treat. Doing this will ensure you baby gets her meds!|`|QUkXsPNIaa	Open her mouth, place the tablet at the very back of the tongue, close her mouth and wait for her to swallow.

Some of them - notably Rhymadil - are manufactured in a "palatable" form and can be used as treats.    This said, there are alternatives to help an arthriticy dog. Herbs, such as Devil's Claw, Willow Bark, Nettle leaf will help with the inflammation. Glucosamine and Chondroitin combined with MSM will help to repair damaged joints, as will the addition of fish oils (NOT COD LIVER OIL) to her diet, which I hasten to add should be a BARF diet.    Don't take my word for this, Google all the terms I have used. My research and experience have shown them to work.|`|PS695Yguaa	I saw this on a vet programme a while ago now,     put the tablet in the dogs mouth, now hold the mouth shut and point the whole head upwards towards the ceiling, stroke the dogs underneck (from jaw downwards) the dog will automatically swallow!!! just repeat if he doesn't swallow the first time.....|`|P3vZh1ajaa	my old cat was on heart/kidney tablets, had the same problem, and she was EVIL so couldnt put tab down throat or would have my hand off.  i used to dissolve the tabs in a tiny bit of water, litrally just enough for it to fall apart then mix up with food, worked for fussy cat, might for your dog........but ask your vet if its ok to do this with her tabs as different.|`|pthz9bfsaa	You could try peanut butter.     If that doesn't work try manually giving them. Hold onto her head over the top under her eyes, use you other hand to push her lower jaw down by pressing on the bottom teeth, then try and pop the tablet in as far back on her tongue as possible. Once it's in hold her jaws shut and encourage swallowing by stroking her neck. You could also try a syringe of water after getting the tablet in to encourage her to swallow.|`|s8QZ4cCmaa	Maybe crumble it up and mix it up?

If your dog is really smart (one of ours is) and still finds it, try putting it in a little bit of cream cheese.

RkbMSKu5aa	I live in long island too and have been looking for a border collie breeder  for a longgggggggg time and i finally found one that's kinda close.The breeder that i found has all different color border collies for sale in may of this year.they will be born in early march which means that they will be 8 weeks old and ready to take home in early may.His name is Francis and he lives in hazleton, PA, but he said that he can meet buyers near the NJ turnpike with the puppies.I recommend going to the breeders home to meet the pups, but if your not willing to take a 2 and a half hour drive to PA, then just meet him at the turnpike.He said that a puppy is $400 without a registration and both parent border collies are on his property.    His e-mail is  fdp1@psu.edu  His phone  is  570-578-8619    if you have any questions feel free to e-mail me
giOALKN3aa	I am a Vet Tech in New Mexico, and if your dog is not eating, something is wrong...maybe a tumor in the stomach, but what you need to do is try to feed her cat food, cat food is always delicious for dog, giver her both dry and canned, in another bowl give her 1/2 a can of chicken noodle soup with lunch meet sliced up. give her some ice cream...anything she will eat, if she turns her head, what you need to do is force feed her, or she will starve to death...  how to do: put about 1 tablespoon worth of food in your hand, put you dogs head back-far back, and shove the food in her throat, you have to do this, I know it sound cruel but it will help.  good luck hun|`|	Did your dog recently get vaccines?  If so they CAN cause lethargy but normally for only a couple days.

CVXCSTHoaa	Here is some info i found on a website i will put the link if you would like to visit it.    Upper Respiratory Infection ("Snuffles")    Rabbits can suffer from infections of the upper respiratory tract (the sinuses and other parts of the tract that are not actually parts of the lungs), and this is usually manifested as runny nose, runny eyes and sneezing. Unlike a human cold, which is caused by a virus, rabbit upper respiratory infections are caused by bacteria. The condition is commonly called "snuffles."  "Snuffles" is is a non-specific, "catch-all" term used to describe such symptoms without naming the specific cause.. Until fairly recently, many veterinarians believed that "snuffles" was almost always caused by the bacterial pathogen Pasteurella multocida, commonly found in rabbits (though often without causing any problematic symptoms at all). More recent information suggests that many different species of bacteria can cause "snuffles." Some of the bacteria most commonly cultured from rabbit nasal discharge include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Staphylococcus aureus,   though there are many others....    Lower Respiratory Infection    A rabbit with pneumonia may show symptoms such as loud, raspy breathing, and may point his nose high in the air and stretch his neck in an attempt to get more oxygen. A rabbit in this condition is critically ill, and in need of oxygen therapy at your veterinarian's clinic. Experienced rabbit veterinarians will often nebulize such a bunny with oxygen as well as products to open the airways (e.g. aminophylline) and to loosen the mucus and infective material in the lungs (e.g., acetylcysteine solution, brand name "MucoMyst"). In some cases, the veterinarian will add appropriate antibiotics to the nebulization mix, depending on what a culture and sensitivity test indicates.    I hope this helps also look on the website and read more.|`|5I7MZjHuaa	Sounds like it sould be an upper respitory tract infection, or pasturella. They need treatment by a vet. Get her to a rabbit savvy vet.|`|AA12302583	I have guinea pigs, they sometimes get squeaky noses like this too. I usually make a note of it and keep an eye on them; sometimes it's just as simple as a little moisture in their nose (like when you go outside on a cold day and get a watery runny nose). A little moisture is usually not a major cause for alarm.     If there's discharge from her nose, though, she's probably got a cold. Check her fron paws as well as her nose for discharge as rabbits wipe their noses with their paws. If you see a lot of discharge, get her in to the vet. She may have sniffles, whih isn't deadly to rabbits like it is with guinea pigs, but it is contagious.|`|JQ2Tv6OBaa	try this you should get her near a heater if this doesnt work its bad,bunny colds are serious so, try the local vet of reaserch online goggle bunny colds my parents ar doctors and i have a bunny video on youtube back to you so try all this   P.S  look at my video its my stair climbing bunny!|`|okJuemOUaa	I worry about my bunny too.

bnJLKQWMaa	Please consider finding a dog that is more suited to a warm/hot climate.  A Newfoundland has extremely thick fur and even in the harshest weather in the frozen Northwest (where I live) they are outside a lot.    It will be downright unkind to subject a dog to extreme heat.  Consider going to a shelter and finding a dog with a single coat (not 2) that will do better in hotter weather.|`|MJnF0pfFaa	omg no|`|nI8G21y8aa	They are sensitive to heat: provide them plenty of shade and cool water in warmer weather.

3FL3zIKsaa	Oooh, you will also need a spray bottle of some sort to mist the frog. :] They need moisture.   Check a local walmart or dollar store to find one for about a dollar.  Most pet stores *nameless* sell them for like $20 and they do the same job...    Oh, also, they need distilled water. You can just leave a bottle of tap water out for about a day or so and it will work just as well.    Smaller pacman frogs eat crickets to start off, so make sure you have something to put the crickets in. Most crickets die in about a week, so be prepared for a lot of trips to the store. lol.    They also get really big and can live up to 10 years and longer, so be prepared for commitment. But, they're really cool pets.  They don't move much, but I take mine out and talk to him. ha ha he croaks back. He's adorable. :]      Hope this helps. |`|BX8rrBajaa	It sounds good to me!

mL0BjDQWaa	Try adding gravy granules and a bit of warm water they really like it (this will only help if she dousnt like her food not if she is off it because she is ill)  Check that she is drinking and not dehydrated this will be a big sign of weather she is ill or just of her food.  Hope this helps :)|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Lucky you, fantastic choice of dog. At 3 months she is still very small & perhaps her teeth are not too sharp (unless she nibbles you). I've got a Whippet puppy who was faddy my solution was to give her the same food as my Adult Whippet.  I now feed them both on Wagg Worker Complete probably not the best dry food in the world but add a little warm water or gravy & she will beg for it.  So I suggest that you add a little warm water or gravy to the dry food, it could be too hard for her to bite. I must have done something right because the old girl will sit & wait for the puppy to finish her dinner. Good luck.
d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	I personally feel that the bad breeders, regardless of what "type" of breeder (mill or byb) are responsible first.  They are the ones allowing uneducated owners to take in dogs they know nothing about or are not prepared to properly care for.  They are not screening owners and they don't have a take back policy on what they sell.    While I agree that we need to see the general population be more responsible with pet ownership, I truly believe that if the breeders who sold the dogs took more efforts to place properly, then we'd have less issues... but then again, that might make it less profitable for them, so it will never happen.|`|Os6VjLH0aa	I have to say uneducated owners. If people educated themselves about the breeds, they would also learn how to find a reputable breeder, thus leaving no demand for bybs and mills to fill.  If folks took a little time with choosing a puppy instead of having to have "that breed they saw on TV" right NOW there would be no more demand for mills and bybs to fill.  That's MO and i'm sticking to it.|`|PdotFx4naa	Well, a lot of these contribute to the population of unwanted pets.  I would have to say 1 and 2 (for sure).  Uneducated owners are at fault for not doing the research but it's also up to the breeder to do checks on the owners to make sure they are getting a dog that's compatible with them.  This goes back to  1 and  2.  These "breeders" do not care, they just sell the pups to anyone.  Oops litters are to blame but I don't believe it's as bad because most of these people sincerely care about their pets and usually give them away for free and keep tabs on these pets.  They are not for profit.   Either way, they're all at fault but I believe most of them are puppy mills and byb's.  Puppy Mills are the  1 because when they get caught they have all of their animals taken away and guess where they end up??  You got it, shelters, rescues and humane societies all over the us!  Puppy mills should be stopped but how can we do this?!|`|bgrWmZH4aa	I'd have to say puppy mills.|`|AA11992723	It's hard to say. They all need to take responsibility. Numbers 1 and 2 and 4 should know better so they seem like they are more wrong, yet those who remain ignorant choose to be ignorant instead of researching about where to buy a new puppy and why not to buy from petstores and BYBs.    Number 1 I think are guilty of the most abuse just because of the numbers of dogs in one puppymill.     Every dog owner who says "accident" is wrong. it's irresponsibility not accidents.|`|PM23RDycaa	All four really, to what extent depends on the particular area.  s 1,2,&4 often lead to number 3 happening in the first place|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Tough call cuz they all are at fault.  I considered oops litters to be the same as byb & ppl who have no idea about breeding lumped all together & I would say this group is the largest contributor to be decline of quality & health for all breeds.  Puppy mill certainly rank up there but there are by far more dogs bred by the uneducated general public than mills.  Ppl never do enough research as seen here.  They claim to have fully research their breed but don't know the answers to simple questions. So whether they are breeding their dogs or are surrendering their dogs - ppl are to blame for their own actions & irresponsibilities to a species that has no say in how it is treated & used.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	3)     as much as i want to say 1 or 2 i thin the majority really is uneducated owners that buy dogs not knowing their personality, at least thats where the majority of purebreds get put in shelters and BSR.|`|cETQuE9waa	I can't say just one.

sbB0TpGXaa	OK since you ar new to MFT's here are the basics of their gaits.    flat foot walk.  Same footfall as a walk but a little faster.  The horse extends a little farther and steps quicker for a fascinatingly smooth ride.  However few horses can travel in this gait at any speed.  Some can and it ends up turning into a rack.    fox trot.  The most sure footed of all gaits (even more sure footed than a trot).  Diagonals are used like the trot but the rear leg is brought up a tad sooner than the opposite front and set down a tad sooner.  The more time their is between the rear and opposite front the smoother the ride.  This gait is also excellent for stamina.  This gait is not as smooth as the other gaits nor is it generally as fast as the running walk and rack but the sure footedness makes it a useful gait, and the preferred one over rough ground.    The running walk.  This is a lateral gait similar to a pace.  Meaning both feet on the same side come up together.  However with the running walk like the fox trot the rear leg come up before the front and back down before the front.  This is a very smooth ride and can be traveled at higher speeds than any other except the faster racks like the singlefoot.    The rack  This is an equal beat gait, meaning it is neither lateral like the running walk or diagonal like the fox trot.  Instead the feet fall at equal intervals.  The single foot is a type of rack where their are intervals when only one foot is touching the ground at a time.    Now your first six photos are all fox trotting.  Then the next two are a running walk .  Then the last one in the first group is a fox trot.    It looks like it could be flat foot walking in the grass.  hard to tell from a photo since the foot fall pattern is the same as for a running walk just different timing.  That is why they call it a running walk even though it is actually a modified pace not a walk.    Most of the ones in the second set are the fox trot but one may be a rack.  I can recognize the rack better from the saddle than from a photo.        It is hard for me to see which leg is leading in your photos since your horse is black and her legs are in shadows.  I will get back to the others after supper.    In fox trotter show you do not want her to running walk or rack.  Silly of the registry since almost everyone that rides fox trotters wants the horse to be able to running walk over smooth ground since it is smoother and faster.  But those are the rules.  Thus show horses are trained to fox trot and flat foot walk on cue and not to running walk.    Your mare has some natural talent but I can not see head shake from a still photo.  Her head will need to bob up and down in the shows.    EDIT Horse rep is correct on the first photo it appeared to me that she was bringing her right front forward but that was the black color and poor quality monitor fooling me.    The first IS a running walk.  2 I looked at  1 twice.   3 the same thing happened to horse rep.  Def a fox trot. diagonals coming forward at same time.    4 a pace?  No Fox trot if diagonals are moving together.  A pace is both legs on the same side moving together.    And your mare has a excellent fox trotter conformation.  Though the newer style TWH's are bred to look more like them than they used to.    Black cloud C grew up around here.  I know the people who foaled him.  Some of his get have very good gaits but many have a tendency to pace.  Do you know how to check up your MFT to keep them in their gait?|`|QTT9380Yaa	she looks like shes pacing|`|rpA9y3Wuaa	fox trot|`|Oiabe82gaa	I'd say where's your hat, and flip flops are really not suitable footware!!|`|vow5ULxTaa	I own both TWH's and MFTs and to give you a rundown of what each photo looks like the first is a running walk.  2) pace( typiclly gaited horses will pace in the pasture becasue it is a easier but uncomftorble gait for the horse to perform)  3) running walk  4) pace  5) fox trot( if you film her at a fox trot it should look like she is troting with her front end and walking with her back)  basiccly she does a running walk and a fox trot in most photos here    are you sure she is MFT she looks more like a TWH than MFT.    TWH:http://www.champagnewalkers.net/images/C...    MFT: http://www.arkansasfoxtrotters.com/pics/...    edit-  her dam has nice breeding.  Her Sire dosn't have any reputable lines though.    the sire may have been a grand champion but he dosn't have the famous lines like Lady Anne.  Midnight Travler E. and Merry Go Boy.      and the trainer in Ocala that you are talking about the realyl popular one down ther has done some wonders for my friends Show MFT's he got one of her pacing fox trotters to fox trot. She can't get her to fox trot now but he was able to get her to do it in 5 minutes but said she wasn't show worthy.

It seems that as people get older, the smaller they want their pet to be. It just seems as you get older the more simplified you want your life to be. You want things easier, less stressful, less complicated. Often they can find a small breed easier to pickup to hold, easier to care for, easier to take for walks, and cheaper to care for. . They often choose a short hair dog so they don't have to deal with shedding pet hair. They want a pet they can pet and hold in their lap. They want a pet that is loyal. They want a pet that is sweet and not to rowdy. A mini dachshund and a chihuahua both easily falls into this category after their adolesent stage.

F3LBgfvwaa	For kitty-proofing mostly put stuff away that they could scratch up or damage, or anything that could hurt them, sharp objects, chemicals, etc.<br>  <br>  For allergies don't let the cats on your bed and sleep with the door closed so the cats don't get in your face. I've heard that those air purifier things help a lot.<br>  <br>  Make sure they know where the litter box is. I put them in the litter box and let them navigate from there so they always know where it is. You might want to get another litter box for another room, they like to have more than one.<br>  <br>  They will get over being semi-afraid when they get used to you more.<br>  <br>  Always have food and fresh water available for them.<br>  <br>  Hmm that's all I can think of to tell you. Let us know if you need more answers. Enjoy your kitties!|`|HMkowdwNaa	Question 1.  Kitty proof a room?  Ha!  Okay, seriously just make sure you put away things that you don't want them to mess with and wrap up cords that might be dangling and make an attractive toy for them.  Keeping them in one area for a while is a great idea.<br>  Question 2.  Your mom can try over the counter allergy pills.  They work wonders for me and I am allergic to my cats.  If that doesn't work she should see her doc.  Saying you can't have cats because you're allergic is just a cop out so don't even think about it!<br>  Question 3.  I wouldn't worry about that too much yet.  If they are really little yet and they're using the litter box and burying it really well you might not be able to tell it's there until the litter box gets a little dirtier.  However, if you're worried that they're using the litter box at all then place them in the box after they eat, when they wake up from a nap, and after they've been playing for a while.  Eliminating in a sandy/dirty area is an instinct for cats and once they do it as a kitten it becomes habbit.<br>  Question 4.  Just be gentle and patient around them and they'll come around.  It just takes them awile to get used to their surroundings.<br>  Question 5. I can't really tell you without knowing HOW young they are but there are lots of wonderful informational sites that tell you all sorts of things about kitten growth and development|`|Lwi5wJUlaa	Congrats on the cat. Keep anything you don't want hurt by the cat out of its reach. Your mom should get ca hair on her or touch her eyes after petting the cat.

They might have the runs at first but they should go away within a week.|`|Mz6cO1Paaa	ok as for the kitten i have 2 cats of my own and a kitten to and she has a nice little area in the bathroom and you need to show them the cat box as for food you may want to pick up some kitty milk and mix it into the hard food and if they are to young you will need to get the milk anyways cuddle them a lot they do not know where they are and cant find there mom so that's why they are hiding everywhere it will take a few days for them to know that this is home and as for the peeing thing it could be one of two thing they just are really scared it took my kitten two days before doing anything or the other thing they may have already done it and you just don't know yet my kitten went under the chair where she was hiding  you need to keep there food very moisture  and put water out for them but having them in the bathroom has always worked for me and as for your mom you could just keep the carpets very clean and get a air purifier |`|fSBXeKPFaa	It is best to raise kits in pairs, anyway!  It is better for them socially. <br>  <br>  If you are going to have one, you may as well have two and you may as well get two from the same litter! <br>  <br>  How old are the kits?  If they were old enough to be taken from momma (at least eight weeks) you shouldn't have to stimulate them to pee and poop.  But, you can always do that, if needed.  Momma cat stimulates them by licking those area, so.... you take a warm, slightly damp cloth and wipe those areas in the same fashion.  Hold them over the litter tray.  Make sure the litter tray is low enough so they can get in and out easily.  <br>  <br>  About feeding, you do need to get a dry food made for kittens and feed them kitten specific food at least until they are six months old.<br>  <br>  BTW-- if either is male, please wait until he is about 6-months old before neutering.  Some vets say it is okay to neuter earlier than that,but many experts say early neutering is linked to kidney diseaslatertr in life.  Why risk it?  Just nb sur to get it done at six months.<br>  <br>  If the kits are less than three months old, I'd keep them in a smaller room at first, especiallifof you have to leave them alone.  They feel safer that way, too.<br>  <br>  Do give them a speciaplacece for them to cuddle in.   Put in a few of your old t-shirts.  (If you wear it and don't wash it, that will be even better becasue it will smell like you!)<br>  <br>  Here are some links to kitten info!<br>  <br>  Enjoy your new kittie buddies! <br>  <br>  This page has info about telling the age of the kits: <a href="http://www.rescueguide.com/orphkits.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rescueguide.com/orphkits.html</a>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kitten-rescue.com/general_care_of_kitten.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kitten-rescue.com/general_car...</a><br>  <br>  Also, it is a good idea to have any kit checked out by a vet early in life! <br>  <br>  |`|ybaeu04Baa	1) Cover cords, they sell cord covers for ferrets at PetSmart which have kept my cats from chewing any cords.<br>  <br>  Also, becareful of what you put on your countertops because the kittens could knock them over and break them.<br>  <br>  Make sure to keep the toilet lids down so they can not drink toilet water (I know it sounds like a dog thing but cats do it too).<br>  <br>  2) Your Mom will have to go on allergy meds.  You can also try getting a humidifier for pet dander.  Also brush them daily to decrease the amount of fur they shed.<br>  <br>  3) Since they are so young they will hide because everything seems so big to them.  Try attracting them with furry toys and toys that are on strings.<br>  <br>  4) It depends on how old they are.  If they were weaned from their mom they can start on kitten food, dry or wet.  I personally choose dry food because overtime it helps clean their teeth and it is less fatening.  To litter box train them place them in the litter box so they get the feel of it..it shouldn't take long for them to get used to it.  Clean the box at least once a day.

IuYekkPVaa	Sometimes cats suddenly decide that they no longer want to use the same box for urinating and defecating, so try adding a second box in a different location to see if that helps.    He might also be doing it to mark territory.  Are there any cats oustide (even if he only sees them through a window) that he might feel intimidated by?      The web site below has a helpful check list of 18 reasons why cats stop using their litter box, and if it turns out that he is marking territory it also has advice on dealing with that behaviour.    http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...    Use biological (enzymatic) washing detergent mixed with warm water as this will remove all trace of his scent.  After cleaning, place a dish of dry food at that spot as a further reminder that it's not a suitable area for toileting.    Hope this helps.|`|uF0guMdJaa	Try giving him another cat box, that is the only thing that worked for my cat. If not ask a vet.|`|Vcb2kWbwaa	your cat may sense a threat due to it hating your male partner. I suggest a nice warm bath for your cat and also make sure to pour concrete on your floor to cover up the horrendous smell of your cats filth.|`|DXzI2jrEaa	This is usually caused by stress or illness.  I agree with Alexann--try an additional litter box because that really does often solve the problem.  You also might want to take your cat to the vet (along with a stool sample) just to make sure everything is ok.  I had a cat once who was doing the same thing, and it turned out that he had an intestinal bacterial infection which was treated with antibiotics.  Good luck to you and your kitty!|`|8tJPK69iaa	Put a litter box where he is pooping.
dhZlRYURaa	Without seeing your Betta, it is difficult to say. Since he has no fins, it's likely that he was blind before he was even put in the cup. No fins is an indication that he fought another fish, most likely another betta, and was losing. If that caused his blindness, then sorry, there's nothing you can do to cure it. If something else caused the blindness, then your best bet is to go to your local pet store, and try to find a first aid supplement that will be added to the water. your Betta will breathe in the supplement, so there's no need to worry about whether it will eat it or not. The should usually clear up the blindness.    Don't be afraid to ask the person at your local petstore about your fish's condition. Normally there's at least one person there that can help you. The worse that will happen is they'll say they don't know.    Hope your little buddy gets well soon!|`|RXJFJPGlaa	it very well could have been from the water he could have gotten fin and tail rot which is why his fins and tail are gone. Also he could have had some other bacteria causing his blindness i am not sure if it will clear up or not but you can check with an actual pet/fish shop to check for medications to help him....he should be able to sense that there is food in the tank through smell though try a really smelly food like dried kael or shrimp|`|UZZFZ8XYaa	it might have been caused by the water. the wost thing you did was to get water from one of the other tanks. fish need to get used to their water before they go in it. the best thing for you to do especialy if hes blind is to let him pass away theres nothing for you to do for him but to let him go
idzTJOyVaa	I know that is is hard to leave a dog behind. Even when I go on short vacations I still miss my 3 dogs.              What you should do is ask your mom to give Bella to you for two seasons and to your mom for the other two seasons. It is best to have alternate seasons so then you have her in spring and autumn and your mom has her in summer and winter, so then the time between you is less.              Also, if your mom has a computer, buy her a webcam  for her B-day or christmas and talk to her and Bella!              I hope that your mom is reasonable...also if she doesn't give in, tell her how sad you and Charlie are.?                   Hope I Helped!!!!!|`|FewhKlx9aa	I don't understand that because you got a divorce the dog went to your mother?? The dog looks very happy and I'm sure when you see her she remembers you but she has been with your mom for some and is also very happy there and would break the dogs heart to have her move back with you if she could..Just have mom send pictures via e-mail and if you are lonely visit a shelter there are plenty of homeless dogs that would make good pets..You are not replacing her but you are getting a companion to start over|`|CVXCSTHoaa	Well if your mom has a computer buy her a webcam or something and talk to her and see the dog at the same time.   If she has a cell phone and you do to have her send pictures of her. That should help fill the void of her and if you feel up to it get a puppy and that should help also.    I hope this helps.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Beg your mom to let Bella come live with you.  If not then perhaps another dog would help but don't rush into anything.  A dog is for life & it's a long term commitment.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	That's so sad! =(  Next time you see your mom why don't you take Bella with you and that way she'll be with you all the time and Charlie will be happy!  Good luck!  SammyC(=|`|MbdjBUXWaa	That is so freakin sad!! Is there some way i can help? Email me at: Candyprincess80134@yahoo.com|`|j9p3wivfaa	awwwwwwwwwwwww :(|`|zPRWmzr7aa	quick question. did you happen to name your dogs after twilight characters?    just checking.|`|foancrNEaa	maybe the next time you visit her you could take turns with the dog because you spend some time she spends some time|`|ZhttnYsEaa	i duno but you could swap the dogs around and keep swapping them  by the way that dog is sooooooooooooooooooo cute and  they are really good pictrues.xxxx:)|`|qxKaHgKvaa	what a cute dog! :)  Its funny how they are the same names as the twilight characters, did you do that on purpose?  Ask your mom to have her back, why did she take her in the first place?
DQmByQ2waa	Beardies chew their food pretty good unlike most lizards, so size shouldn't be too much of an issue.  It can usually be eyeballed on whether or not the food size is a choking hazard or not.  If you have any doubts, stay with the juvenile pellets.      Besides, I wouldn't switch to the adult food until they're about a year old anyways.  That's awesome that you found a pellet food that they like!  Beardies can be finicky when it comes to commercial foods.  There's only one kind that mine will eat.|`|y8HyP1bzaa	If you are worried about the size, you could always cut the pellets into smaller pieces and soak them in water for a few seconds before serving.    That should make it a lot easier for your beardie to chew!|`|rrFbQZzIaa	Like i said in the other post, you don't really have to graduate to the larger pellets. They all have the same nutrients and since the juvi ones are a lot smaller, they are easier to eat and you don't have to worry about choking as a issue. If they are the same price, stick w/ the smaller pellets. If for some reason the adult ones are cheaper, you will probably want to wait until your dragons are adults which would be around 16 inches or larger. Now I'm assuming these are the repcal pellets? If not, what vegetable pellets you are specifically talking about and the size of the adult pellets would help in determing a appropriate size for your dragon to be when eating them. Really, it's just easier, safer and smarter to stick w/ the smaller size.
6hCj1j4saa	hi depending on what you have in your tank anything that's high in protein should  do the trick like frozen bloodworm most breeds will gobble this up you can pick it up from most pet shops or you could try a pellet food most of your bottom feeders would eat this but i would check the breed to see if they are fast or slow growth hope this helps good luck..........|`|6So3uHtRaa	If they are in a pond they will grow fast anyway. Try Nishikoi pond food.   Remeber though that they wont grow very big if they are in a tank. We moved ours into a pond a year after we had it, it was about 2 inches long. Now it is about 10 inches. (and very fat) We had to get a large sized net.
a03e19c2c6feed0e49819e0271f97e78aa	Twinsburg, Ohio:    Last summer there was this pair of mallard ducks that hung around my yard for several weeks. They would eat the bird seed and drink out of the pan of water I set out for small birds in the area.    When I would get home from work, the pans would usually be empty with the hungry ducks sitting patiently nearby. I would fill the pans up and as soon as I moved away they would calmly mosey on over and start chowing down.    I did not see a nest, though. And no ducklings appeared.    Another I day was reading book in a chair on the porch. I guess I moved so little that a rabbit hopped under my chair and went on his way like I wasn't there.|`|MzJSj7Oxaa	I saw a fox running across my front yard once.  Another time, I was driving down the street and saw a coyote.  And I saw this one animal, I'm not sure what it was.  It looked like a beaver with out a beaver tail.  Maybe it was a woodchuck?  That was when we lived in central NC.|`|da1dcaeaa6d5a578338ee81a7e6ea26faa	I live in the swamp lands of Georgia. and I live on 18 acres of marsh land. Ive seen aligators and panthers...and I once had a rattle snake in my driveway.....|`|ytvLutLXaa	I can't say there have been too many... I've seen a few copperheads in fall which is a little weird... We have cardinals and stuff all the time which is really pretty to see. Of course being in Texas, Opossums are everywhere, but I think they're kinda cute. I did get to see an armadillo a while back, just cruising down the road.  I haven't seen anything too strange in my yard, but I did something in my car once... There was a pig crossing the road and it looked like it had a fork stuck in its leg... Then again, that's South Texas for you!|`|enC9TvxUaa	VERY cool!  Good for you for providing fat for the birds wintering in your area!  Aren't they fun to watch!|`|AA11029380	We have funny looking armadillos in our yard at night.  Glad to see them cause they like our fire ants so much.
b3d93887c70268407904f1afcd1f88faaa	i have 3 cats and foster kittens. As long as you keep your cat's vaccs up to date and flea and worm her then the chances of cross infection is small (if you think about it, if the kittens had been born in a normal situation, their mother could just as likely infect the kittens as your cat could).    Just make sure that you introduce your cat and foster kits slowly so that no one gets hurt.    Good luck!|`|507f5d1dd6627ed845d17676cbe8e0f5aa	i dont know why there should be an issue. cats maybe in the new adoptive home. as long as you give the best care to the foster kittens and to your own...there should not be an issue.|`|qH7BJjTsaa	i think it's ok when you get a kitten|`|hccISKvHaa	I have a cat and they still allow me to foster.  I also think it's a good way to socialize kittens with adult cats.|`|AA11649346	well i say there's no problem just that the older cat have too have manners and not hurt the littel kittens...........|`|B2UcglG1aa	NO WAY! The adult female, if introduced to kittens, will treat them like a mother would her own kittens! She may be a little frightened at first, but will soon lick them and play with them!
pd5rERcfaa	Try giving your pup some activities to keep him occupied while you're away.  Use special toys or treats that he only gets when you leave.  Hide some rawhide bones around the yard, maybe slight bury them.  Kong toys filled with peanut butter are another fun toy that will use up some of that anxious energy and provide new stimulus.  Finally, make sure you take him on a long walk before you leave to get him tired out and in a resting state of mind.    Hope some of these ideas help!|`|Bw18seFqaa	dogs bark because of boredom, lonliness, lack of mental stimulation, lack of training, etc.    Do more activities with your dog.. walk him, do some obedience training, etc.    A muzzle wont stop barking anyways.. nor is it meant to be left on a dog long-term.  Muzzles are to prevent biting during grooming or medical procedures.|`|DJaAl3yiaa	this is what i do with my boxer, she loves to run around the house, in and out, since we have another dog, a male boxer, she likes to bark right in his face and he....well..barks back. but since she always starts the barking, i carry her, put her in the bathroom, close the toilet lid, close the shower curtains, and close the door. until she stops barking, which is like 6 seconds, i take her out, and she stops barking for the day. obviously you're not gonna wait 20 min for your dog to shut up. wait 1 or 2 min and if that doesnt work out, put her out in the back yard and close the door. im sorry, i know is seems cruel, but its the only solution i have right now. and i hate muzzles
4TX26viFaa	No, it'd end up in her milk.  If you have to medicate her, phone your vet and describe the situation. They may have something safe to use.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Actually, mom and the kittens need to see a vet about the worms.  The kittens most likely have them as well. Only a vet should be giving any medicine to a nursing mom and kittens. Make mom a spay appointment while you're there. Throw away the OTC wormer if you bought some. It's useless and could harm mom and her kits.|`|cc07346154ea873f885bcde6cb7230b9aa	What are you deworming her for? Are you 100% sure she has worms?<br>  <br>  Any kind of worm problem is taxing on a cat's body, but when she's feeding kittens at the same time it could be devastating. You need to take a stool sample and bring it to the vet ASAP.|`|6RILqhzEaa	It depends what kind. I wouldn't use any of that stuff you buy at the store. Get something from the vet (yes, take mom and kits to the vet...). The vet will probably tell you to deworm the kittens with the same stuff.|`|f3IdjgiEaa	The cat should have been checked BEFORE it got pregnant, and oh yeah, FIXED too.<br>  <br>  No do not give the mother ANYTHING that can be passed on from the mother.<br>  <br>  Get them all to the vet.  Do not try to treat at home.|`|NCtJeEaZaa	No. BTW Over the counter flea medicine has been linked to many fatalities in cats, I'm assuming that's what you have or the vet would have told you whether you could use it.<a href="http://www.pets.ca/pettips/tips-63.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pets.ca/pettips/tips-63.htm</a>
n4zSSH9jaa	this has obviously been a real ordeal for her, just give her time and let her come to you and she wont blame you, cats have unconditional love for us, hope she is ok soon and that you get lots of cuddles xxx.|`|HsmvTihaaa	I agree with the others re leaving her alone.  She just needs to build her confidence up. Let her approach you when she's ready.      Sounds strange but try lying on your back on the floor, and don't look at her.  If you do look, slowly close and reopen your eyes.  This is very unaggressive behaviour and may help her to come over to you.  Works for me when meeting friends cats!  (Friends think I'n strange but nothing new there.)|`|Jf3WyXFEaa	This might sound dodgy to you me saying this but if she is shy of everything and not sure of you why are you letting her out of the house! if she cant remember you she aint gona always remember where she lives is she|`|bM1TrzGjaa	try giving her a treat from your hand then stroking her when she comes closer when shes eating it, or playing with a toy to catch her attention and curiosity too. good luck.|`|qH7BJjTsaa	i think after time she will not do like this|`|WaI693jHaa	She'll be in shock and wary about everything and everyone.  Be patient and she'll get back to normal.|`|Ntegr2Tlaa	Don't worry she has just gone into self safety mode, just let her be, and she will come back......Don't forget one thing.....The cat's own us and not us them...
29ec6394821e99613460db15778e7787aa	Yes it is very simple to tell the sex/gender of a Land hermit Crab at ANY AGE! Here is how.. BY the way they are not unisex/hermaphodites or asexual there are male and females in order to reproduce.   Yes a female will carry her egg sack, but those eggs are produced by mating of a male and femal and there is another way to tell the sex, ALSO the female does not molt to get rid of the egg sack.. she releases her eggs into the ocean! Hermit Crabs do not mate or reproduce in captivity so it doesnt realy matter anyway.    A pet store will NOT be able to tell you the sex! They have no clue!    Take your crab in your hand, hold him/her above your line of sight.  Take your free hand and bring it steadily in front of your crab.  Allow him/her to stretch out to try to reach your free hand.  (You can even use a pencil for this, in case he or she is pinchy.)  While the crab is stretching out of it's shell try to look on the underside of  the legs.  Now the last pair of walking legs is where you need to look, right where they attach to the Hermie's body.  If you see small blackish dots or spots (one on each leg) then it is a GIRL!!!  NO dots or spots, it's a BOY!!!  Here is further info on the dots and what they do...  These "dots" are actually called Gonopores. They are close to the body near the joint of the last pair of walking legs of the Hermit Crabs.  This is where the male Hermit Crab will transfer his Spermatophore into the female. Though I have read it is transferred onto the female and not within. I guess since they do not reproduce successfully while in captivity, there will be much debate and discussion about this topic.    (Please also note the blackish/dark spots or dots may also be like tiny round holes depending on the actual species)  SO IN CONCLUSION...  Despite of what you may have been told or read while learning about Land Hermit Crabs, it is VERY POSSIBLE to sex your crab and quite simple with patience and a cooperative crab.    Be gentle and take your time, sometimes they can be shy..   wouldn't you be?    NOW ONTO SHELL CHANGES>> Hermit crabs will switch shells much more often then once a year... anyone who says that is nuts. They will change shells as often as they want to, just make sure they have a least 3 extra shells per crab of the correct size, type, weight and opening shape/size. They change shells in order to make room for growth and sometimes because their other shell is bothering them, or just because they see one that they like better. We have crabs esopecially Indos and Purple Pinchers who change sells every couple of days! So It doesnt nessecarily have anything to do with molting.    NOW TO MOLTING>>>  A land Hermit Crab is a crustacean who in order to grow needs to shed his old Exoskeleton which is hard and rigid and does not grow.    Pre-Molt signs:         He will tend to hang out by the water pools a bit more, this is when he is "stocking" up on water helping to soften him up and make slipping out of his old Exoskeleton a bit easier. Your crab will also eat a lot more; you may even witness him eating at odd hours of the day at this time. He may also become lethargic and seem to mope around a bit. Our crabs have also gone shell shopping at this time and have even gotten aggressive while doing so.        A crabs coloring may get dull and ashy and you may notice his eyes become cloudy, sometimes if a crab had lost a limb you may see a jelly like protrusion it is a gel limb, do not be alarmed but the time for molting  is very near.       You may choose to ISO the crab, this is up to you and you will need to judge the space and other crabs as to if this is what you need to do. If you do make sure it has the proper temps and humidity levels and continues to offer daily fresh foods and water throughout the molting process.    Molting:       Normally Hermit Crabs will burry themselves in the sand or other substrate to molt. (There are also times when they will feel comfortable enough to molt within the confines of a hidey area or even right on the surface.) Now when a hermit crab begins this process it is very important that you do not touch or disturb him in anyway unless absolutely necessary. During this process the crab is the most vulnerable to stress and to succumbing to death.       You may even get to watch your crab through the glass if he is buried! You may see him flinch or rock as to help his Exo split so he may slip out of it. He is working very hard to help himself grow. Also at this time he will re-generate lost limbs, antennae and even eyes!     Post molting:     When he has slipped out of his Exo you will see it hanging out of his shell, it will definitely look like a dead crab, do not remove it or disturb the area. The crab is soft and pink deep within his shell resting. Very soon he will begin to eat the old Exo, do not take this from him, as it provides necessary nutrients and calcium to help his new Exo harden and re-gain its color and luster.      At this time if the crab has been is ISO make sure to continue to offer fresh foods and waters even though he may not seem interested now, he will be soon enough. When he regains strength and starts to venture out a bit more, if there are leg pieces or pinchers left make sure to crush those and re-offer that on his food dish, he will eat them.      You can also offer a soothing post-molt diet of organic bananas and organic honey together with fresh organic plain yogurt. This will help sooth him and give him some extra energy. Make sure to offer a good variety of fresh fruits and veggies and also extra protein at this time to help him get strong to either return to the main tank or to become an active colony member again.    Small crabs molt more often sometimes as often as very two weeks larger crabs molt every year or less.  |`|AA11463549	yes they do . If they come out of they're shell far enought  if it is a boy you will see two spots.|`|AA12121778	Determining gender is one of the most frequently asked questions.The truth is it could take up to one year to tell.  Females will grow an egg sac. Females won't grow egg sacs for years at a time in some cases.  And when they do grow an egg sac their not very happy. It's large and uncomfortable and they have to molt to get rid of it.|`|0d94c5b19c284c06a93a0cabb716b547aa	they do, but it's hard to tell. a hermit crab changes it's shell approxamitly once a summer|`|b3f74c56a3abb2416f001c584c9f70a1aa	maybe but i think they are both genders.they change their shell when they get to big for it.|`|f4cb68c85a22a9719b2901d26f32f84eaa	I believe that hermit crabs don't have genders I believe that they are hermaphrodites and that only needed another hermit crab. How often they change there shells you would get many different answers because it depends on all the different conditions that the hermit crabs are put through. I guess for that one you might just have to watch and see.|`|AA11710958	okay really i don't know how u can tell their gender ask the pet shop. i can answer the other. it often change their shell every 2 to 3 months. my shed it between that time.|`|c42709807d173d75e945323545caf4baaa	Yes. The males are called "Hermit". The females are called "Hermione".
YCvgjLdnaa	Lol its ok. My dog is the same, we took him to the vets and it was because they were slightly irritated. I would suggest going to the vets (not because you should be worried) so that they can give you eye drops to sort out the redness. sometimes it stays, but its ok.  I would take it to the vets as it can be a little more serious depending on the thing that has irritated its eyes.  Im sure that your dog will be ok, but take it to the vets to be sure..xxx good luck x|`|nY2hZrUMaa	how red? do u mean REALLY red    if so then take him to the vets  x|`|AA11443269	There are many things that can cause a dogs eyes to be red just like a person.  An allergy often has a discharged, and you've pretty much ruled that out.   Just to be on the safe side I would go to the vet and let them look. It could be a minor infection or something that will lead to a more serious condition even blindness unless it it treated. I am not a DR and one could not tell you without seeing the dog.  Have it checked ut by someone who knows; the eyes are too touchy to fool with.    Let me what the results are?|`|f6A6UM2taa	my puppy as the same, i took him to the vets and they say its fine as long as there is no discharge. when he gets sleep in the corners of his eyes make sure u always use warm water n a little tissue to get it out thou and always sweep it away from his eyes as that can cause infections. but dont worry he is fine.|`|Y89Y34sFaa	does he need worming thats a sign|`|A21SswSfaa	Without seeing the eyes, there's no way to tell.

29ec6394821e99613460db15778e7787aa	Please go to http://www.geocities.com/hermitcrab_resc...  That is our site and our info is there too and I will be happy to walk you through everything each step of the way.    They live up to 30 years in captivity IF you take good care of them.. (if they only live a year or so then the care was not good.)     Land Hermit Crabs are portrayed as easy to care for, cheap and novelty pets. This is not really true! There are some basics that you need to know before actually buying your first Hermit Crabs. Read on below and then you can decide if this is the pet for you.     It will take a bit of an investment at first and daily maintenance as well as closly monitored tank conditions that must be kept very specificly in range.     Also over handling will eventually kill your crab due to stress, they are not a pet/pet and are not meant to be taken out and played with.    Here are the basics...   Sea sponges:             Natural, un-bleached and un-dyed sea sponges only. Non-man made. These can be found in pet stores and in some department stores as well.            They need to be rinsed and dried to keep bacteria and uglies away, so have an extra or two so you can rotate them. Boiling will also sterilize them.  Thermometer and Hygrometer:                  Land Hermit Crabs, breathe through modified gills therfore they must have the proper humidty in order to breathe as well as the proper temperatre in order to thrive.                 You need to monitor all of the tank conditions. One for the temp and one for the humidity will get you started. Keep them as close to substrate level as possible since that is where the crabs are most of the time.              76 - 80 degrees and everyone will be fine. Do not allow the Hermit Crabs to get cold for long periods or they can die. Humidity ranges should be around 76-80% relative, sustained.                 With in these levels your crabs  and their home will be a happy and active one. If it gets too warm, you can always prop up the lid, same if the humidity gets too high, prop the lid up.To add moisture/humidity add an extra moist sponge or even a bubbler in their water dish.       Housing:             Glass tank with lid (aquarium with glass lid is best) Can use a quality Kritter Keeper with saran wrap over the lid.  Substrate:             Options include... Calci-Sand, Sterilized playsand, Aragonite Sand, Moist coco-fiber bedding, Crushed coral.        You can mix and match, have seperate areas and containers, it is up to you. Remember there needs to be enough substrate to fully cover the "floor" or the tank. Deep enough for your largest crab to fully submerse or cover it's self. The substrate also needs to be pretty smooth, meaning little to no jaged edges to scrape or injure the Hermit Crabs Exoskeleton prior to, during and after molting.  It also must be insect and chemical free. Human or animal grade not the kind that is used for construction or masonry.  Light:         Hermit Crabs require 12 hours of sunlight each day. This can be a combo of natural and artificial light. The normal aquarium hood light can be good enough.       Once you are ready to get more advanced or need more heating you can buy a bi-light that has both dayglo and nightglo bulbs.. for heat and light during the day and heat during the night. Always try to have full spectrum when possible so the Hermit Crabs get enough of the proper lighting.             Water basics:             Use only de-chlorinated or bottled water for everything Hermit Crabs related. The chemicals in tap water (chlorine and heavy metals are toxic to Hermit Crabs also will burn their modified gills.)             You can treat tap water by using a water conditioner for fish, make sure their drinking water doesn't have stress-coat in it though.             Land Hermit Crabs must have both fresh and salt water for drinking. The salt should be obtained from a good aquarium store or pet department, reading the directions carefully.            The fresh water should be de-chlorinated as well. Both dishes should be deep enough for your largest Hermit Crab to fully submerse it's self, while at the same time provide items like shells, smooth stones for your smaller crabs to use to get in and out of the water. One or both water sources can have bubblers or sponges, it is up to you.    Misting Bottle:           Have one ready if your humidity drops, or to spot clean a crab who you want to play with, or to physically check. You can also have a second one with fresh salt water to control mold and fungus. This water also must be de-chlorinated and Hermie Safe.    Food:         Provide a nice selection of fresh and dried foods daily. Fresh foods can stay for 24 hours or less only because of mold and spoilage. Dried foods can stay for 2 or 3 days as long as you monitor it carefully.         Rotate food selection so that you crabs do not get bored and live a more natural scavenger type life. Check out our food lists.          Heating:           Land Hermit Crabs live in tropical areas, there for it is quite warm and humid. First there is the heat. Sometimes the lights you use give off a fair amount of heat, yet that does not reach the depths of your substrate when some crabs may be burried.          A UTH (Under Tank Heater) will answer this issue. Found in the reptile area of most pet stores and available in a variety of sizes.. once firmly attached to the bottom of your tank, it will provide heat to the substrate which some crabs prefer.         Make sure you have a cool side and a warm side. UTH should not be used on plastic Kritter Keepers due to warping and the toxic fumes some plastics can give off.. so watch where you stick it!

I'm not sure how long they live, but most pet stores and some grocery stores sell food made just for hermit crabs. They also need water. My cousin also has 2 of them, so he gave us some tips, like to play with them (I no it sounds weird, but just take them outside of the tank/cage they live in) and to get a new, bigger shell for them to go in when they grow out of the old one. I think there's a certain kind of shell that u have to get.|`|AA12121778	http://www.hermit-crabs.com/|`|c486a4928ee69927a4b80eb31bb6d114aa	these are easy little creatures. just have several shells that you buy from a local pet shop. because as they grow they'll need new housing. have a small bowl of water. you can look up all they eat on the net but we used a hermit crab food from our pet store. i think they live a year or 2 but you can double check that.|`|e323687ff6aa93b34d9fb6d0b856b0b5aa	they live for 1-5years. i know, wow. they eat veggies, meat, fruit. make sure you give them a water dish. they also need some shells bigger than the one it already has. it sheds it's skin and gets bigger. it needs a bigger Shell. : )
2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	1) get them neutered  2) step up on their training  3) crate train them when they can't be supervised  4) TAKE them out on a regular basis don't just put them out or let them take themselves out  5) confine them to an area instead of allowing them full run of the house  6) NEVER, EVER rub a dogs nose in it's business this is very poor training practice and it only serves to make the problem worse!!!|`|j2uIE5xmaa	take them out every hour until they pee, especially after they've drank or eaten|`|xYsCC5UXaa	train them all. it should help some, if not more.  and just as well; you should make sure that you are the top dog, and that they know that.  it will help them to stop the territorial issue [marking is a sign of territory claimage].    in few cases, neutering will help; but it is NOT a guarantee.  but they should be neutered either way, and your females should be spayed.|`|FewhKlx9aa	If they are not neutered they will be doing this as they are marking because you have females..If they are all neutered then you need good training and need to crate them again and start from the beginning.When they go outside lots of praise and a treat..Get them fixed and your problem should be solved|`|KxjUim7yaa	Neuter and spay everybody.

MySpVCAsaa	Kittens may take more than one time to get trained to the litter box. I would suggest that you continue to show him where it is located, and take his paw and dig at the litter. Continue this process as long as needed, until your new friend catches on. Try to think of the kitten like a child ready to be toilet trained, it takes more than once to tell them about it.   Best of luck with your new companion!!|`|7dc556d67f0e9a4f5714fa5d96b331b7aa	I recently rescued a kitten I found outside and I had the same problem.  What I did was clean up the area well with vinegar and put the litter box where the kitten went to the bathroom.  You can also put some of her waste in the box to give her the right idea.    I waited a few days to make sure she understood this was where she should go and I slowly moved the box to where I wanted it by moving it about a foot a day.  She has never gone back to using anything other than the box.    Your cat also may not like the litter box you have (especially if it's covered) or the type of kitty litter you are using.  If this continues try switching brands.      Her not using the box can also be a sign of kidney infection or other illness so if this continues see a vet and have her checked out.    Vamp|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Well you have to train it first.  They aren't born knowing exactly what to do with a litter box.|`|mUm8PCRzaa	Ha, once i had a kitten, and we put it in the litter box, but it actually climbed out and pooed.    Repetition. If it pees somewhere other than the carpet again, pick it up and put it in the box again.  Over and over, and it will eventually learn|`|anjf5PTFaa	keep putting him into the box untill he gets used to it then he should learn|`|9AnNb7Tbaa	Keep training him until he learns. Just like a child, he wont know what it is right away. Try putting him in the litter box after he eats. It will give him a clue what the strange box is for.|`|hPgRvmTUaa	Some kittens are smarter than others. Some know straight away that the litter box is for pee etc... others don't. They are kinda stupid, if you know what I mean. We got two kittens a few years ago and straight away one of them knew what to do. In fact, he seemed to encourage the other one to do as he was doing. But, the other one hardly ever did it in the box. After a while they had to live outside when the weather improved.The smell was just too much. Then they started to fight. Now the clean guy lives here.The other one left.|`|MXfjnK0saa	Everytime he has to pee you need to put him in his litter box so he knows where it is and he will start using it.|`|FvmLWWRnaa	The kitten is a 13 week old kitty so he is still young. You might want to show him the litter box everyday till he knows I pee here. He might not be used to the litter box and he thinks he can pee anywhere he wants you just need to teach him where to go. Hope he learns!|`|I4ydg5pTaa	Yup. Thats exactly what my kitten did. Because he's not familiar with the house, you should scold him when he does that and take him to his litter box. When he does do it right, give him a treat or reward! Good luck with the kitty!
AA11443269	Although most don't lay down some do it's not big deal. Just think of yourself; If you have a long reach isn't it easier to just plain get closer?  It isn't any different for them.|`|AA11992723	it's good if yours does. In a new study by Perdue University they found that raised food dishes are a risk for bloat (2nd leading cause of death in dogs) So maybe big dogs instinctively lay down? wolves do..  my little dog lays down too though.    oh and well probably because big dogs would have to bend their legs to eat and that would be uncomfortable.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I had a dog that did that, and it turned out she had back and hip problems.  You should have your vet check out your dog for that just to be safe.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I have a medium size dog. He stands to eat and then lays in his bed to chew on something to clean his teeth.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Have you tried raising his food bowl?  I know that it is recommended for tall dogs like Greyhounds, Lurchers & Irish Wolfhounds that you buy the feeding bowls on a pole so that as the dog grows/ages he will not be straining his neck to eat.|`|5atczOqzaa	how high is the feeder. larger taller dogs feeders need to be higher so that they do not have to bend down to eat. it helps digestion and is just better for them. so if his feeder is low he is probably having a hard time digesting and it is easier on him to be at the level of the feeder.    try getting a higher feeder. he might just like to lay down but if this is something he has just started I would say he needs a higher feeder and water dish. to be best for the dog the dish should reach their chest.    I do have one dog that will lay when she is eating but this is just because she pulls the food between her legs and hides it from the others.    really I would not be worried about it he may just prefer to eat this way.    I had a dog once that would not eat till he had burried his food in the dirt first no matter what it was he had to dig it up to eat it. some dogs just like different ways of doing things.    I did find this site on the bloating issue that was brought up.     I have never lost a dog from this personally but who knows.    http://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/0/01...|`|CblODn2Kaa	I have a black lab, and she's done that ever since we got her (age 3). It's a bit weird, but I guess some dogs are just more comfortable like that.|`|raJETLfRaa	Is the bowl always put on the floor? Because if it is then chances are it strains the muscles in his neck when trying to reach the bowl. This is the most likely reason he lies down. Try raising the bowl off the floor by putting on a box, doing this also ensures the weight of the dog is spread evenly instead of being pushed onto the front.|`|exny4cOwaa	i think smaller dogs tend to lay down, as it's easier for their intestines to digest the food when they are lying down, and they have a smaller mouth so it takes longer to chew, and their legs would get tired standing up for that long. aha, mine would! But bigger dogs tend to gollop their food down faster so they stand up. (:|`|4a1c094d2d7bece5584f157f33442119aa	yes  my dogs lay down to eat..

lhOd2hvXaa	For some it is sheer function (short or no-haired dogs).

For example,for short haired dogs(or no to little haired dogs)coats,and/or sweaters,are a necessity in the winter when outside.    Also,though not needed,rain coats are good for the rain.    Hairless,or almost hairless,dogs need to wear clothing,and sunblock sometimes(in the summer),to protect their skin.    Also,come on,you can't tell me some dogs don't look adorable in some clothing?    As long as the clothing doesn't bother then dog,and it can do anything it could without it,it's perfectly fine for them to be clothed..Also,as long as they don't get hot,or too hot,in them.|`|Bw18seFqaa	my dog is hairless..  he needs clothing for warmth and to protect his skin.

If it is a chihuahua then they are fashion accessories & look ridiculous.  If it is Winter & you have a Whippet or racing dog they are dressed up against the cold. A Whippet etc., has no spare fat so they feel the cold.  In the house they may wear pyjamas or jumpers but out walking they wear fleecy waxed waterproof coats.  They can also be seen wearing little furry bootees when it is really cold out there.  If you ever own a Whippet & hear it howling because it is cold you soon wrap it up in something warm. Big dogs just wear coats to keep them warm & dry.|`|UaLlyLAaaa	Because they want to.|`|exny4cOwaa	Celebrities dress their dogs for popularity, and to make their dogs seem like toys to be messed around with.     Normal people dress dogs to keep them warm, a simple jumper in the cold weather is okay, and they do winter boots, for young puppies to keep the dirt from the street from getting in their paws. I think that is acceptable, but for dogs too be dressed in diamante and little caps and fur dresses. that is wrong.|`|BSKJdZK3aa	becauswe they are psychopaths|`|oWjJR5F0aa	some people do it just cause they think its cute.    but some people do it because their dog doesn't have thick coat and it gets cold for them during cold weather.    like my dog he has a really thin fur, but he sleeps outside so we almost thought of getting him a little doggie coat haha :p  but we settled for blankets in his dog house.|`|u0jamFpFaa	As a lot of the above comments have stated, some owners of the small dogs with little body fat dress their dogs in sweaters to keep them warm. Other people just use their dogs as their own little Barbies,dressing them up to match their own outfits even. The clothing on a dog does mask the smells a dog produces when it meets and greets a new dog, preventing them from getting familiar with the other dog. It would also be very unreasonable to put a lot of clothing on a heavily coated breed, such as a Siberian Husky or an Alaskan Malamute because they already have a low heat tolerance.
enC9TvxUaa	-That really is too long, BUT, do not leave her outside or in the house to run free.  Way to many things to get her in trouble when she is left alone!  Can someone come over a few times a day to let her out and play with her a little?|`|NAGiNKFWaa	It is usually 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a two-month-old puppy can only be alone/hold its potty for 3 hours at the most.  So depending on the age of your puppy, you need to come home during lunch and let him out, or get a dog walker, pet sitter, family help, someone from church, just until the puppy gets bigger.  He shouldn't be anywhere unsupervised, inside or outside.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like tsst and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they dont know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you dont want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.       REVISIONS:    *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.   *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place.   *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.   *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.    *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying go finish until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesnt sneak off, or for strange places.   *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, |`|dXGvp5sVaa	Eight hours in a crate is a very long time...I would get a puppy-sitter, or just let it out, because it will need to stretch its legs.

YFi64qyeaa	Your safest bet is getting a puppy from a small breeder with only a few dogs. Ask to see a copy of AKC papers and make sure they have DNA on file. This ensures that there is no cross breeding or falsifying papers.Ask for the vet phone number and call to verify that both the male and the female had their pre mating clearence and make sure all of the puppies were checked within 24 hours of birth and are receiving proper nutrition and care. A good breeder will suplement puppies with puppy formula along with their mothers milk and they will also give extra vitamins. Before visiting the breeder ask to receive several pictures of both parents and the puppies. After you visit request a picture to be sent to you through email each week so you can see the progress of your puppy. Good breeders do this anyway and any breeder that acts like it is a problem isn't a good breeder. When you visit make sure there is no signs of caging or kennels. and make sure the puppies are being raised in a temperature controlled room. 85-90 for the first 2 weeks and 75-85 up to 8 weeks. Ask the breeder if they have had their soil tested for bacteria or parasites if the puppies are  allowed outside. If they do not request that your puppy have a fecal testing done before taking him home. The seller is responsible for treatment of all illnesses. <br>  The key top knowing a puppy mill is when the breeder has more than 4 dogs and they have more than on breed. There is no way puppies can receive the proper care if there is more than one litter at a time going on. Good luck and don't be afraid to ask tons of questions. Good breeders will be more than happy to answer and provide you with any info. If a breeder shows any sign of annoyance with your questions than he is not the breeder for you.|`|AOTnJQtQaa	Funny story, I had always insisted on pure bred dogs.

He is a rat terrier/doberman mix and everywhere I go people comment about how cute and friendly he is. I wasn't looking for a rat terrier at all, but once I saw his face I made up my mind. A lot of pure bred dogs are inbred, and it is true that health problems don't show up until later, and you could end up spending a lot of money at the vet. I would look around at the shelter. You can even find purebred dogs there because a lot of people don't realize how hard it is to care for a dog, and then they drop it off later. A friend of mine found a purebred Siberian husky puppy at a shelter a few years ago. If you do insist on getting one from a breeder, make sure the dog comes with papers.|`|6XTETdJaaa	Steer clear of puppy mills!<br>  <br>   The dogs health issues do not come from the outward environment and develope with time, they come from terrible breeding practices and are genetic. The people who run puppy mills breed for profit. Thats it. They dont health check the parents and breed dog with illnesses and defects. meaning the puppies inherit all of these illnesses. Puppy mill pups are always unhealthy and will likely cost you thousands in tests and treatments before it dies a premature death.<br>  <br>  You are not rescueing these puppies if you buy them , you ARE however supporting puppy mills. Meaning you pay this individual to continue breeding ill dogs  and forcing her adult dogs to live in awful conditions until they die of exhaustion, illness, or in many cases put down or shot. In a breed such as the english bulldog which already has many illnesses they are suceptable to, you want to get a dog from a show lines breeder who does health testing<br>  <br>  Many do cross breed, esspecially with smaller breeds being the rage right now, they cross any two dogs and then give it a cutsie name like shi-poo, buggle, lahsa-doodle. etc.. In the case of an english bulldog its more likely that they will just breed two very unhealthy dogs who dont remotely resemble the breed standard. So technically it could have AKC papers, that just means that the dogs in its bloodlines where genetically bulldogs, not that they actually met the AKC standard in appearence, health, or temperment<br>  <br>  You should always be able to see where the dog lives, many of these breeders will pull a fast one and bring the pups to their house for you to meet them so you dont see the living conditions. English bulldogs are expensive for a reason. They are the most difficult breed of dog there is to breed. Look at their unnatural body shape and you can tell why. They almost always require a C section and many times pups are born 'walrus' and have to be euthanized immediatly. So thats reason for the price tag. Search for a good breeder first and then worry about the price<br>  <br>  A GOOD breeder:<br>  <br>  - Has health records on all her breeding adults. Proof that they have been tested for all genetic illnesses and are clear. She should provide you with her vets number as a refference<br>  <br>  - Has healthy looking dogs who meet the breed standard. Ideally many of her dogs should be championed, this shows a commitment to breeding dogs that meet the AKC standard, a true bulldog<br>  <br>  - Should have a clean kennel and home. Never breed more than one or two breeds of dogs. Three and up is a puppy mill tip off. Her females should not be bred every heat cycle, its very taxing on them. Ideall once every year and a half to two years. A good breeder should have waiting lists. If pups are readily available usually there is something up.<br>  <br>  - She should give you refferences of other satisfied puppy parents|`|ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	A puppy mill is NEVER a good idea!!

IuYekkPVaa	Biological (enzymatic) washing detergent mixed with warm water is good for cleaning up cat urine.  After thoroughly cleaning the affected areas, spray it with surgical spirit (disinfectant cheap at the chemist).  This will remove any remaining odour which is tempting him to spray in the same places each time.    Getting him neutered will definitely help reduce his desire to mark his territory, though it will be a couple of weeks before his hormones calm down.  If the spraying has been going on for some time, you may need to confine him to one room and then gradually allow him access to the rest of your home.    The web site below has a really good article on why cats spray, with lots of advice on how to treat this behaviour.  You'll also find information on the most effective methods of cleaning urine from all types of flooring and surfaces.    http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...    If your budget allows, then I'd recommend buying a Feliway diffuser.  They emit an aroma that cats find soothing and can really help with spraying cats.  (If money is tight, the web site above has advice on a DIY alternative to Feliway).    Hope this helps.|`|xBd96wvRaa	You will have to neuter him.

Cats like to mark their territory. When cat urine dries on the carpet it forms crystals and those crystals are the source of a serious cat urine odor. These crystals make cat urine removal very difficult. When you try and remove the cat urine with a normal cleaner the cleaner usually masks the odor of the urine and you will think that you have removed the spot successfully. But these crystals reactivate their odor in moist conditions and you will find the extreme cat urine odor returning again and again. You need to use a cleaner which can break down the crystals formed by the cat urine to get rid of that extreme odor completely.    Just for Cats by Nature's Miracle  Our very favorite products is Just for Cats by Nature's Miracle odor remover. This product is guaranteed to remove all traces of stains and odors. The best of all is the price - you won't find anything for this price that removes cat urine odors nearly as well.        Urine-Off  Urine-Off is one of the most advanced cat urine removers we have come across. It is contains specially formulated enzymes to break down the crystals formed by cat urine on a chemical level. This is one product we can definitely recommend!        Wee Cleaner  Wee Cleaner is a powerful and unique cleaner that works by neutralizing urine instead of covering odor with an annoying perfume smell. Wee Cleaner removes urine odor so that it never comes back. Use Wee Cleaner on carpet, rugs, clothing, tile, concrete, brick, plastic and mattresses.       Cats don't urinate all over the house to annoy its owners. There are a number of reasons why a cat will leave its super strong urine everywhere. Some studies suggest that cats are marking their territory but it may also be that your cat feels threatened in some way or that your cat is stressed. This marking is known as spraying. This is not done in a different manner than the usual urinating process. The cat lifts its tail and sprays urine on objects. This is usually done on vertical objects like walls and furniture rather than on the floor or carpet. This urine usually has a more serious odor than that the odor left when urinating normally. Cats that have been neutered are less likely to take on this behavior but it may still be found. Male as well as female cats mark their territory but this behavior is more prone in males and in a female cat in heat.     Your cat could be stressed. Yes, cats do get stressed out. Here are a number of reasons why your cat might be stressed.        Unfamiliar faces and people   Moving house   Other cats in the region   Other pets   Unfamiliar objects like new furniture   Your cat might be ill   Your cat's litterbox is dirty   Another reason for your cat urinating everywhere could be because of an illness or bladder infection. One should try and catch your cat in the act and see if he is spraying or urinating normally. Try to see if the cat is showing any signs of pain while urinating, which normally means infection. Blood in the urine is also a sign of a urinary tract infection.     Remember that if your cat is urinating all over the house there is usually a reason for its behavior. You should try and figure out what this reason might be because this will solve all your problems and leave you with a happy cat. Finding a good product to remove the odor is not a complete solution for either you or your cat!
ZNDqYUwkaa	Is the emergency vet at a clinic that is manned 24hrs? If it is, just take her down there, they cannot turn you away.   If not and you have to call first to get a vet that's on call, say this:-    "I called you earlier regarding my female dog that was spayed on the 22nd Jan. You advised me to call the surgery that performed the operation but they are closed and I am worried that my dog may have or get an infection.I want to have her checked out as it is the weekend and I will not leave it until Monday when an infection would have had the chance to set in."    See what they say and if they still don't want to se her, ask what constitutes an emergency with a post op dog and ask them what their duty of care is.    I wouldn't advise it all the time, but if you are genuinely worried (and I think you should have her seen before Monday), tell the vet on the phone that she seems to have a temperature and is not acting quite herself.    She may well have a temperature anyway, but you won't know this if you don't have a thermometer.    Like I said, don't lie if you don't have to, but if it's a case of telling a little white lie (which may turn out to be true) or not getting your dog seen until Monday, just do it.    I hope she is ok and don't be afraid to be firm with them and demand they see your dog....that is what they are there for.|`|dn2tsXlBaa	period?|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Take your dog to the emergency Vet.

VNvVhDWgaa	I am so sorry for the loss of your beloved Charlie... I just lost my lhasa, Shortie, last April. And, like you, i got another dog. One of the hardest things about adjusting to a new dog is realizing (especially when they're untrained), that they are not going to act like our previous dog. They have their own personalities and quirks and we have to adjust to that.    The dog that i got was an abused dog from a puppy mill. So he was not much better than a puppy as far as training went. One of the best ways that Petie and i have bonded is our nightly bedtime ritual. I get settled in, and he jumps up on the bed and curls up with me, and i give him a good rub down all over and tell him how much i love him, and how good a boy he is and things like that. That helps not only build his confidence, but it also gives us a nightly ritual that he can depend on that gives him some love and affection.    Another thing you can do as well, is take him out for a walk once a day for 30 minutes to an hour and make sure he uses the bathroom. This really helps him feel more secure because you're dedicating that time for him, and he knows that if he needs to potty, that you will take him outside. It may take a little time before he gets used to the routine, but he will.    There are rarely incidents in which i think an animal deserves a punishment of any kind, because most of the behavior they do that is unwanted, is simply because they don't know any better. Saying the word NO very firmly with a bit of a raise to your voice will definitely get their attention. Also, if he has a habit of say.... pooping in the kitchen every night when you go to bed or something, put papers down, just so he gets used to the fact that the papers is where his business goes, not the floor. Gradually you can move them to a new spot that is out of the way but still in a place you'll remember to check them.    Once in a while i've gone so far as tap him with a finger on his nose, but that is very rare, and he has to have done something really really bad....  they don't mean to, but they don't know any better. When they follow your instructions, don't chew up the furniture or your shoes ( like Petie did ), then give them a treat. I give him 1-2 treats a day, because i'd rather him eat his food than live off treats like he'd like to. When you give him a treat, get him excited about it... make a big deal out of it for him, because that makes him feel better about himself, and helps the two of you bond even more.    Obedience school is really wonderful, and you should seriously look into that. It will teach you and him a lot, as well as make things between you go so much smoother.    After being abused for the first 3 years of his life, Petie will now reach his 4th birthday as a happy, healthy, active, and very loved little guy and he knows it. He's still coming out of his shell, but i'm being patient with him and letting him take his steps at his pace, not mine, that way he feels more and more comfortable all the time.    He has slept with me on the bed every night that i've had him, he is beyond overjoyed when i come back after having gone somewhere, he's finally gotten to where he'll come up to me and poke at me with his nose to let me know he wants attention (before he acted like he was terrified to see anyone approach him), and he plays in the house and enjoys it while i tease and play back. He gets a good workout from that alone.    Be patient, it takes time, and make sure he learns the word "NO" quickly. That is the one most important word for disciplining a dog or cat, is that they know that no means they aren't to do what they are doing or about to do.    Hope this helps! :)|`|34177bb54269d5ebbff24c7a4a6881d1aa	instead i 'spanking your dog', i suggest, i fhe does something wrong, say, going into a room he isnt meant to, correct him instead into a wanted behaviour. in the example, tell him clearly 'out' with a hand signal, dogs pick up very well with movement because of the way their vision is - and move him out if he doesn't do it hiself. when he's out. reward. a reward could be simply high pitched 'good boy!' or a treat. keep him interested. he'll do it more if thrs a chance of a treat. :D  another example is if he attempts to chase something you dont want him to. instead of shoutig and spanking, say sit (if he does know i hope) as a corrective behaviour and reward. i hope you get my dirft here.  bond strengthing is definately training. u got the treats, he knows it = special bond :D a good cuddle a groom helps strengthen. just every day tasks like walks helps. i know its frustrating sometimes, but stay calm. and remember, whenever training and you get frustrated. take breather. cut the session and do it again when your calm. dogs pick up on your feelings and mood aswell.    hope this helps!|`|d0C8NfUhaa	get into a habit of letting him out every hour or so, when he gets used to the routine, he will know what he's soposed to do outside, or you could try those wee-wee pads that you put in your house for puppies to go in a certain spot if you cant let him out that often. for other training, i would recomend a shock collar. my grandparents have one for their gold retriever. it has a shock setting and a beep setting. the beep is so high that only they can really hear it. if you have it on the low setting, it won't hurt him, its just a very unpleasant vibration and he will imidiatly know that he did something wrong when he feels it.    Spanking a dog is NOT okay. your dog will become scared of people and that would have the opposite affect that you want.
FewhKlx9aa	Keep her calm when she goes outside to do her duty get her right back in the house..No running no jumping on furniture..She can so easily tear open her stitches on the inside and that will require emergency surgery..So do your best to keep her quiet,no playing|`|NAGiNKFWaa	You just need to do the best you can.  She should not be doing any jumping or running and anything that would get the stitches wet.  The concern would be that she would rip the stitches.  Make sure you know how to contact your vet after hours if you have any drama.|`|zvqspfSCaa	just be careful. my mother has a chocolate lab that she got fixed and she is a really hyper dog. there is nothing you can do to change the nature of your dog so just watch carefully so that she doesnt rip her stitches like my mothers dog|`|9G03aQhsaa	When I had my cats spayed  I was told to keep them calm or they could re-open the incision from too much activity.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Yup this is always the hard part with the young dogs! We always say leash walks ONLY for two weeks after being spayed - NO off leash walking. This is of course hard for people with bouncy dogs, but very necessary - she's had major abdominal surgery (tho she isn't acting like it!!) and she needs exercise restricted so that her wound can heal up. If she's too active, stitches can pop or hernias can even form.     Don't take my permission to take her out tho, phone your vet and see what they think of the idea! And remember, if a human had had this surgery they would be bedridden for weeks - try to remind your dog she's had major surgery!!    Chalice

Don't expect these to be cheap. And anything that isn't bought in a petstore is not going to be good for your dog.<br>  <br>  Some pills are made to where the dog likes them because they are flavored. Some dogs like taking pills. But if these pills aren't flavored and/or your dog doesn't like taking pills, buy some pill pockets. They are about $7, and the ones made for cats will work. I force feed my dog pills, though, because he doesn't mind, but I always reward him afterward. Pill Pockets are little pouches that are made of chewy stuff that dogs love. You put the pill in the pill pocket, and give it to your dog.

sia5clQvaa	(if you have a weak stomach, caution reading) IT will be three years agon on October 9th. I was trailering two horses back from a college rodeo in San Luis Opispo. My college was North of Tahoe in the Mountains. So we had about a 9-10 hr. haul. When I was about an hour to an hour an a half from Sacramento I felt a huge motion from my trailer. Nothing I had ever heard before. I had my Horse Misty and Oskar in there. Misty had been trailered all over the West Coast. She was only 7. I owned her since she was 2 weeks old. Well anyway I was like that didn't sound right. I pulled over on the shoulder of Interstate 5 and had a friend jump out and see what was going on. He came back and said my mare was on the ground. I was like thats wierd. Maybe she fell asleep. (not normal) I had a 2 horse slant load Apache made by Circle J. I jumped out and looked. I thought well  maybe she can't get up cause her head is tied so I untied her so she could get up, but still nothing. So I thought maybe she is affraid to hit the divider(she was in the back slot). So I thought Ill get in there and help her get up safely (because she was that kinda horse, she never panicked in situations). So I opened the back door and thats when the worst thing I had ever seen showed its ugly face. My mare rolled farther on her back to where I could see her stomach and I got more then I asked for. Her whole stomach had split open from chest to teets. It was right down the middle of her (like when you clean a fishes guts out.) Everything was out. I saw her intestines and all. I panicked threw the gate shut because she was trying to come out and I was still on the Interstate. At this point more of my team mates were pulling up. there were about 4 or 5 rigs lined up. They threw me in another truck and drove mine to the nearest off ramp to a field. They needed to get Oskar out because she was thrashing a lot and kicking him. They luckily got him out.  Now just about my whole team was there (about 40) all with rigs. We called as many people as we could to get help etc. There was no hope she was dying and stepping on her self. They waited for me to make the call and I finally was able to actually say go ahead help her on her way. Even if their was a vet in my trailer at the time of the burst she would not have been able to be saved. She would have suffered longer and died of damage or infection. Unfortunetly we couldn't get a vet there to help us and euthinize her or even animal control or an officer to shoot her. No one would come out. As wierd as it seemed no one had a gun with us either. (a bunch of cowboys and hunters, usually one will have one).But not this time. Its a hard reality to face but they had to cut her throat to help her die faster because she was just bleeding to death at a slow rate. We thought of driving to Davis but she would have died on the way there from all the bleeding. So the best thing was to cut her throat. I didnt watch that part. They took me away. I can still hear her cry for help when she went into shock and was standing up like nothing was wrong except screaming to the other horses. I hope it is a sound that non of you have to hear. It is a haunting sound that never goes away. I had to sell my trailer because after they cleaned it for me and then I bleached it 5 times I still smelt death even though everyone else thought it was fine. We never got an actual conclusion as to what really happened in the trailer. But when she was about 2 months old we had to have surgery done because of a hernia. well I learned later that sometimes the stomach linning wont heal up as strong and over time it gets weaker and weaker until one day something as easy as a cough/sneeze/bump in the road can cause it to burst. My team and coach drove her the rest of the way to my college and burried her out in a field under some big trees. So now and again I drive by there and visit. I am in a new town because I transfered to a university, but I am planning on moving back up there.<br>  <br>  Thanks Easy Rider and Equus|`|oyCq6oG0aa	Morzlucky.....I am sorry that you had to go through that and that your baby did too. <br>  <br>  Parents will agree with me here. <br>  <br>  The scariest moment is watching your children on a spooked or run away horse knowing you cannot help. <br>  My son was riding his mare and I was riding a green broke gelding with a few other people. My sons horse spooked and went side ways and my horse which was right beside him went the other direction. Luckily he was able to calm her down and easily stayed in the saddle as all teens do "like monkeys I swear" but being the concerned parent when my horse spooked I naturally pulled back and kept him from running the whole time my eyes are watching my son and not paying a bit of attention to the fact that I am hanging off the side of this horse and pulling the reins with me along with the horse. I lucked out when I seen his face and realized he was ok but I wasn't. I was able to hit the ground lightly but quick enough to let the reins go so the horse didn't land on top of me.|`|OaPHnngCaa	my friend wanted me to take his TB on the trails for the first time while he rode my horse.  We were well into the trails when all of the sudden a deer comes outta no where and was about 10 feet from the horse i was on...well, the deer bolted and my friends horse ( the tb i was riding ) appearenlty thought it was a race; it was fun for me...until we came to like a little stream thing and the horse stopped like right at the edge and i got tossed out of my saddle and was cought in my stirrup...thank god the horse didnt freak out completly and my friend was able to dismount my horse and help me....i guess that would be the most scariest only because of what could have happened.  But it was fun....only cause i didnt get hurt lol :p|`|DrZTpyRgaa	3 years ago at a horse backriding summer camp on the third day I rode a different horse and half way through the lesson and they horse tripped but didnt fall.

I wasn't hurt but stopped riding for a year.|`|zMuqVloMaa	I was lunging my 14h pony when I was 10 and he just went into canter but all of a sudden he started pigarooting and was very lose to kiking me, I calmed him down after about five minutes then got on him, It had rained the week before and it was hot so the ground was hard as rock. We just went in to a anter when all of a sudden he stopped i took my left foot out of the stirrup to get off when all of the sudden he started bolting down this massive hill we have in his padock and my other foot came out of the stirrup and he pigarooted i went flying over his head breaking my arm in two places when having him trample on my legs, wasn't fun!|`|TO2bnvwLaa	i was riding this thorough breed in an indoor ring and it was raining so the tin roof was making alot of noise and she started to spook. she started galloping full speed and trying to buck me and smash me into walls.i was really scared because my knee was just getting better ( recent injuries to it) i ended up holding on or the whole thing and never fell off.i managed to stop her after along time and just lunged her til she was better.|`|npOPJYKnaa	Well I haven't really had one because I take lessons and I ride really well trained horses but.. let me think....ok well i was on a trail ride and walked right past a HUGE water holder thing and this big boom went off in it and my horse spooked and thats it lol not really scary at all oh well I tried haha|`|qqXS82lFaa	i was like 5 years old  just got my horse we were riding down <br>  the road and a couple of white stallions ran up from the pasture on the other side of the road.spooked my horse and we rared ALOT it was the 1st  time i had been on a horse when he rared.but i stayded on!|`|LHXmk3wpaa	i was training my horse to jump but a loud noise went off and we were jumping at the time and he bucked just before he jumped and i landed straight on the jump and he cantered off but came back.

On a trail ride, she decided to walk her horse into a creek to let him get a drink.  When they got in, it was deeper than it had appeared.  She hadn't taken the reins down over the horse's head to lead him in...they were closed reins, the kind that form a big loop from bit ring to bit ring.  She led him in by one side of the rein loop... he began pawing the water, and when he put his head down to drink, he caught his leg in the rein.  He panicked and fell, and couldn't get back up...he flailed his legs as his head kept going under..the owner couldn't get at the reins and couldn't help him, and he drowned in a couple feet of water. I've had close calls and scary accidents,  and I wasn't with them when this happened, but heard about it when the barn manager was called and asked for help to get the horse out of the creek.  Most of the scary things I've done or seen ended up okay...this one ended up the worst of any I can remember.|`|GnMFPib5aa	i got a new horse and i was riding him for the first time. i guess i wasnt paying attention or somthing cause hE suddenly went from a jog to a lope and then kicked  up his heels and fell off. luckily i was wearing a helmet!!|`|9LH3Dz5Laa	My worst experience happened about 2 months ago.<br>  There was a tornado in the area that we live in and me and my mom were trying to get the horses in the barn out of the weather cause the lightening was horrible and she was leading one horse and i was leading the other two horses.<br>  The horse my mom was leading spooked at something in the bushes and took off backwards which scared the horses i was leading.  The horse on my right reared up and knocked me into the horse on my left which jumped sideways causing me to fall to the ground. He lost his balance and stumbled stepping on my rib cage.  Very painful and scary.  Never attempting that again.|`|nIskOkn2aa	I was quietly riding my own horse on a quiet, well known trail on my own farm, enjoying the fresh air and birds singing, riding on the buckle.  The horse was happy, walking freely forward, ears pricked.  A trail ride like we'd done a million times.<br>  <br>  Next thing I knew, my horse was backing up at about a hundred miles an hour, half rearing every step, bonking me in the face with his poll.  It was so fast, and I couldn't get off because his head kept bonking me back into the saddle when I'd go to get off.<br>  <br>  He kept backing up, his hind end lower and lower and his head higher and higher, till he was completely sitting down for just a fraction of a second before he went over backwards on top of me.  I was already dazed and concussed from the bonking, and hardly aware what was going on at this point.  <br>  <br>  He landed on top of me.  Didn't feel good to him (or me either), so he rolled off.  Then, instead of getting up, He ROLLED BACK over me the other way, then decided to get up.  He thrashed around, struggling to get up, walking all over me.  I couldn't move by this time, though I was conscious.<br>  <br>  He finally regained his feet, looked at me laying in a bloody heap, and calmly began to graze!!  <br>  <br>  After what seem like an hour but was probably just a few seconds, my riding buddy, who hadn't immediately realized I was in trouble (she was in the lead), reached us.  She'd seen the end of it, but from a distance.  My first words were...  "M'glasses....  Can't see..." because I'm blind as a bat in daylight without them.<br>  <br>  As it turned out, the horse was in worse shape then me.  Despite years of experience, I had had no warning that he was infected with EPM.  This was the first symptom we'd seen.  He had completely lost control of his hind legs for just long enough.  After that, I didn't ride him, of course, until he was diagnosed, treated, and rehabilitated.<br>  <br>  So my SCARIEST HORSE EXPERIENCE was....     (drum roll, please!)                                       ... getting back on him 3 years later!|`|hEXb1unraa	Well I have a few, some are scary, some strange and some funny. The 2 scariest was 4 of us were out on a trail ride, me, sister, her husband and my nephew. As we were riding on a new trail for us, the Gully trail, as we called it, at the bottom was a stream bed, we were told to be careful as some areas were a quagmire, like quicksand. So were on our way staying clear when all of a sudden my nephews horse, a 20 yr old MFT,  shys from something, of course she never shys, except today! and BAM she in that crap, its like 1/2 quicksand and 1/2 clay just awful crap she immediately sinks up to her belly, my nephew gets safe but this horse is STUCK and struggling, we are trying to get her to stop fighting as its making her sink faster. Thank God we had a rope with and a knife. My sister is also up to her waist getting stepped on and kicked and the mare is trying desperately to regain any kind of footing, we put the rope around the saddle horn and while I pulled my sister had to reach down into the thick clay and get her legs free so she wouldn't snap them off, still  getting the crap kicked out of her. this is taking some time, as we are thinking it doesnt matter if we get her out she gonna die of shock, my sister is a vet btw. finally in combination of me pulling and her freeing legs we finally manage to pull her sideways across the top of clay trap as she gets to her feet shaking like a leaf. We were still a good hour ride away from home and medical help. All and All, we made it home and she only had some minor scratches and made a full recovery, shes still going strong. Scary, never leave home without a rope and a knife, never. The other scary one for me was we were out on a trail ride again, the 4 of us and Im in up front with my nephew close behind riding along at a nice lope, and my sister yells and points to head up the hill, so i continue at a nice slow lope up the hill and I hear my sister yelling, I can hear her but cant make out what shes saying, I turn my head around as I  reach the top of the hill , only to find out its a drop off.......down goes the horse, he does a complete somersault as do I,  I land on my feet, still holding onto the one rein and catch my sunglasses mid-air, the horse ends up on his feet, not a scratch and my nephew goes, "that was the coolest thing I have ever seen, It looked like a move from the movie the Matrix" Unfortunately, that was the accident that landed me in the hospital for a week with a bulging L5 disk injury. The horse was fine, not a scratch. I have tons more but dont want to bore anyone.......lol|`|at7LXbEfaa	i was trialing a horse, supposadly easy to ride and all of a sudden he bolted and wouldnt stop, i fell for the first time.<br>  My friends quite TB gelding went crazy for the first time, he bolted, bucked and then reared.|`|aetCEz6Paa	Umm... I haven't had anything that was really terrifying. My mare fell on top of me one time but it was in a soft arena so no harm really except some minor whip lash. Another time I was on a trail ride with my TB and he started getting really frustrated because of the bugs. any way he took of on me and when i finally got him stopped he reared. The rearing wasn't so much the scary part but the fact that I stopped him on a paved road and he had back shoes on freaked me out. All I could think of was him slipping and falling back on me, plus we were right next to a main road and I was worried that he would run off and get hit. Anyway, I somehow managed to slip of while he was in mid air and he came down and just stood there looking at me with this terrified expression in his eyes. <br>  <br>  I guess the scariest horse experience would probably be when we were jump judging at a big horse trial. We saw that ralph hill was coming up next so we turned to watch him come over the jump before ours. anyway his horse hit the jump and flipped and he ended up having to be air lifted to the hospital. yeah so it was pretty much horrifying. (he's since recovered thankfully)|`|wmS4Hw4baa	So, I was new to horseback riding, and really new to cantering (never cantered before).So, I got paired up with a huge thouroughbred named Dodger. I had herd horrible stories about Dodger.So, I got on Dodger, and right from the start, he pulled the reins out of my hands. I picked them up, and it happend about 40 more times!!! He was following the riding instructor, and pawing to the ground like he was going to bolt!!! MY RIDING INSTRUCTOR DID NOT HELP ME!!!! I was getting attaked by this animal!!! I was freaking out inside!!!<br>  So we came to the trot, and my instructor held on to my horse, and he threw his head up, and started cantering all the way across the arena!!! I was sliding off!!! My riding instructor said, pull back and say woah...... ya, Im gonna do that... WHEN my reins are NOT in my HANDS!!!! So, the other, better one stopped my horse for me. Scariest thing ever!|`|HM1FmcW8aa	wintecs saddles stirrups are terrible & very different, they just kinda hook on, but i was about to jump about 4 ft, my highest yet, and right when i went up in my two point my stirrup flew off and my whole body flew off the saddle and landed right on the jump, but of course that scared my horse x.x<br>  <br>  i wasnt hurt, just scared.|`|LtwOF6Bdaa	okay.. well..<br>  i was riding this stubborn shetland cross named treasure. she wouldn't canter. (i was kinda new to cantering so didn't kno exactly what to do.) i had my feet out of the stirrups because my riding instructor was adjusting them. all of a sudden, she cantered off and around the ring like.. twice. i was freaking out! but, in a way, it helped me without stirrups. <br>  it may not be the scariest thing, but keep in mind, i was like.. 8.|`|LplwlGzMaa	I was on a trail about a mile out from the barn with a small group (my mom and two teenagers). I was on three year old (at the age of 10 how smart was that) and I had never ridden her before so I opted not to trot/canter and walked with one of the other girls to the end of the trail where we would all meet up. Both of our horses walked fast and we made it to the end of the trail before the other people (who had taken the long way). We were waiting and the young (5-6 year old) gelding behind us decided to take an intrest in the mare I was on. She went balistic. Total rodeo pony. After 6-7 huge bucks she took off back to the barn. The gelding spooked and tried to run with her which fired her up even more. I lost a stirrup and she had a simple D-ring bit. Not exactly best conditions for trying to stop a run away. After about a 1/2 mile or so (over a bridge and through the woods....thank God she was skinny and fit between the trees) she started bucking again. I got a nice flying lesson. She kept going. All I remember about the fall was a hoof getting really close to my face. Thankfully it didnt hit and it proved a good distraction from hitting the ground. She made it saftely back to the barn. Somehow I wasnt hurt and pretty much knew where I was. I crawled back to the main trail (she had taken a little used side trail) where I met up with some random lady. My mom trotted up shortly there after. She had taken a while to get there cause she didnt want to gallop after us and re-spook my horse. <br>  I relived the fall in my mind for awhile which was the hardest part. There was so much that could have gone wrong. I ended up being forced back on my 17 year old to lazy to spook quarter horse. I cried when ever he went above a walk cause I was sure he would take off. I never did get back on the mare. It turned out she was in heat and no one had noticed (genius I know) which was why she had reacted so badly to the gelding. I learned a lot about horses that weekend and the fall probably proved good for me. I no longer underestimate ANY horse. So there is my scariest.

bnJLKQWMaa	I would not choose one for several reasons.  There is a guy in my small town who just got a pup and already the pup is dragging him around and being dominant over him.    Every one has different dogs they are attracted to and I am not attracted to them.  I like herding breeds as they are so intelligent and easy to train.

They have eight legs to help them crawl better. see link    there is a strong functional reason for its evolution. In general the possession of 8 legs allows these animals to move with greater facility in directions other than forwards. Both spiders and octopi can often be seen moving backwards or sideways rather than forwards. In octopi, the legs are also used to manipulate objects and to sense the envrionment and it is also useful for them to be able to do these things in many directions at once. In contrast, insects with six legs have a definite stronger tendency to move and function forwards.|`|AA12108695	1.spin web with their backlegs and hold on with the front legs while spinning  2.crawls better on webs with eight|`|c119fcbc69e3b2ff7b517e864adbbe63aa	Because they do!|`|f01e7ebd2724d0873be325206f403a40aa	Because that is the way God made them.|`|AA12121778	To distinguish them from insects.  Spiders are not insects for two main reasons: they have eight legs, and they have two body segments. All insects must have three pairs of legs and three body segments. However, spiders and insects do share some common features - they both have a hard skeleton, called exoskeleton; they both have a segmented body; they both have jointed legs. If spiders are not insects, what are they then? Spiders belong to a group called arachnids.

A great way to get your new pup to submit to the older one and vice versa is to turn them over on their back and let the other dog stand over them.  That way they both have to submit to the other.|`|x4yJ5EAEaa	I would get a female, because if they were both boys the other one might get jealous so.....

Also, if I am going out or come home to my pug with a nice outfit on, or just do not want hair on it, I just change right away before picking him up....simple, but works.Also, use pet shampoo that helps prevent shedding.
dRUgXlOLaa	So how do we handle this situation? Once again, we want to be sure our young charge is healthy to begin, so off to the vets office if you haven't been recently. There is a medical condition that can cause chewing in pups aside from the normal tendencies they have of chewing to explore their world. This illness is called Pica and causes your pet to eat non-food items in an attempt to deal with nausea. So please visit your veterinarian and make sure your animal has a clean bill of health.    The next step involves understanding that, while chewing is a normal and healthy part of any pup's development, it has acceptable and unacceptable outlets. Puppies learn about their world thru chewing much the same as human children. They use their senses to explore the new world, which lies before them and their tactile sense, and sense of taste is brought into play as they chew on various objects. Much like human children, pups also need our protection from the dangers that lurk in their explorations. Electrical cords, needles, poisonous houseplants and household chemicals, even chocolate, all pose very real threats to your pet. It is your duty to protect the animal from these dangers.    Consistent training with the "NO" command can do this. No is a word your dog should learn early and respond to instantly. This one word has saved many dogs from many horrible fates. The pup is trained by repeatedly using the "NO" command every time a situation occurs. If you pet is caught chewing on your shoes, say "NO" in an affirmative tone and take the item from the animal. Do not let it become a game of tug-o-war. Rather, remove the item quickly or back up your "NO" with a spray from a water bottle, a loud clapping of the hands or a light but convincing tap on the nose. This little diversion is usually enough to make a dog lose interest in whatever they may have been chewing on. Also, do not give chase to an animal chewing on an undesirable selection of chew toy.    They will interpret this action to be a game and they will be most happy to play for hours on end. Instead, calmly work your way towards the animal and then remove the object. For items that are habitually mistreated, a chemical additive such as Bitter Apple may be in order to impart a foul taste to the item and make it unpalatable for the animal to chew on. Crate Training is also effective to stop chewing behavior and we shall discuss this course at length in later articles.    You do not want to completely destroy your dogs urge to chew however as this habit is healthy for them when exercised correctly. Instead, offer them suitable objects for their chewing pleasure. Perhaps a dog toy ( For quieter households, remove any squeakers from the toy. ) Rope toys and crunchy dog biscuits provide good outlets for a dog's destructive behavior and also help to keep up the oral hygiene of your pet.    Also be aware that all animals are different. Your dog may react differently than another dog in a given situation. Some dogs develop aggressive stances upon attempts to remove an object from their possession. If your dog becomes aggressive and territorial, then professional assistance is highly recommended to avoid further problems or biting.    With these simple suggestions, you can insure your pups' good health and the well being of your book collection. You might even find the time to spend some quality time reading Cujo again with your new best friend.|`|foancrNEaa	get him some more toys because when dogs are puppys they need something to chew on|`|AA10275738	Put a muzzle on her until she is  through  teething. But she really needs to chew. Best thing to do is correct her. Every time you see her chewing on some thing she shouldn't, take it away and replace it with a bone or other toy.|`|ixFbNr4taa	You have a wild teenager on your hands!!!!    1.  She's teething so the "bad" chewing may continue for a few months.  Make sure she has the opportunity to chew the correct things.  I used something called a Chilly Bone which is wetted down and frozen to relieve gum pain and soreness.   Change bones/toys more often as they can get bored with old stuff (how like a teenager!!)    2.  Get into obedience class.  Chows can be stubborn and willful while Labs can be exuberant but eager to please.  What do you have??  And it's the teenager thing again -- your cute pup is spreading her wings and trying to be higher up in the pack then your "weak", young granddaughter.  Totally normal for a dog but NOT ACCEPTABLE!!  You must train her NOW!!   Get into a series of classes -- I would strongly suggest 3-4 sessions (7-10 weeks each).  You (the grandparents) should go to class together and learn the training techniques.  Then AFTER the first session when your dog is behaving better and getting more mature. -- Involve your granddaughter!!!  You could make it a point to do this as a group each week.  But get some training on the puppy first before involving Rachel.      GOOD LUCK!!!|`|exny4cOwaa	Take her to your local dog training centre. It's a great experience and you're dog will like being with the other dogs, whilst your dog is learning that nipping and chewing is a bad thing.     Or maybe it's just a puppy stage, she might get tired of it and give up. Or lightly tap her nose everytime she does this, and whenever she does it, punish her by putting her away from you all.     Hope I helped.|`|fgxajTiBaa	If you really had her from just a few weeks old then she lost some crucial behavior development in terms of bite inhibition and appropriate pack behavior.    Check to see if there is anything at all consistent with the times that she is being nippy. Is your granddaughter being a little 'over' zealous about seeing the dog? Or is the dog coming out of nowhere and nipping?    Also, has anything changed in your household that would cause her stress?|`|AA11027952	Well I'm not an expert, but I do believe that any dog regardless of breed and I think age too can be trained and even re-trained if need be.  Have you ever watched the Dog Whisperer-we do on occassion-anyway I agree w/ his method of making yourself the "pack" leader.  That's what I did w/ our dogs-now they still have slip-ups on behavior here and there, but we just correct them at the time it happens.  Repetition and alot of love should help.  Just always keep a watchful eye-esp. were nipping is a concern.....you may also need to teach you granddaughter how to inter-act w/ you dog too?  Good luck and take care.
XK9RLaPeaa	Animal control will kill him, so its a good thing they are closed. Call a Wildlife Rehabilitator in your area, and tell them it is an emergency. They will come get it, if they aren't too far away. Please do something though, dont let him suffer. Opossums are not notorious rabies carriers! Their body temperature is much too low to carry the virus, and their bodies are very good at fighting it off. Look it up online if you dont believe me. It is possible for them to get it, but highly unlikely. They do have literally hundreds of teeth though, so dont go near it. Please find a Rehabilitator, there are lots in SoCal. Good Luck!|`|AA10025824	stay away from it.  They're dangerous when they're hurt or cornered.|`|pd5rERcfaa	Whoa.  If possible, don't leave your house.  Possums are notorious rabies carriers, and this may be the case here.  Keep any pets away from it and certainly stay away from it yourself.  Maybe give the police a call?  It seems overkill but that's what I would do.  Just be careful!|`|EfqPwhu1aa	Ohhhhh poor thing!   Well don't go near it because  Opossums have rabbies and you can  get sick. But please make sure that whomever  you call they won't kill him! So I would say call animal control  as soon as they are open but make sure they're going to help him the release him! DON'T LET HIM DIE! ! ! ! ! ! !
VSX9tzJaaa	my chihuahuas do the same thing. they raise their leg when they want attention or want something. when my chihuahuas want to go outside in the front yard, they will stand by the door and sometimes whimper. If that doesn't work, then they raise their leg. maybe, they're trying to make us feel bad so that we can get up and open the door faster. so most likely, they just want attention or want something from us.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	It means "give me a treat", so get off of the computer and give the poor thing a treat.|`|PumYhJSvaa	Sounds like begging.

XurYYreBaa	He should see a vet asap.  It could be an infected tooth or an abcess.  Both are painful but very treatable with the proper antiotics & care.  A tumor is another possibility but since he's not eating & it developed so quickly it seems less likely than the other 2.  Good luck.|`|34177bb54269d5ebbff24c7a4a6881d1aa	if your rat is tame enough, feel it. is it soft and loose from the skin? its probably fatty (is he old by the way?)    if its hard and stuck firm on the skin, yes, its possible a tumor. or in better cases, beningn/a cyst.    he may not be eating as its under his chin, he may not be able to reach it, or the lump presses hard on his oesphagus (food tube) so it feel uncomfortable. or maybe it is a tumor causing that.    it could also be an abscess. is he livng with other rats? or maybe a sharp object within his cage poked that area? if its an abscess, you should se a hole or some form of entry into the skin where the wound has been infected resulting in the abscess. an abscess also starts out as a hard lump that goes soft.      never the less. either way, whatever the case.... it IS causing a problem. call a vet to get it removed pronto.  hope this helps|`|AA10003191	Could be a tumor, an infection, or something else.

Good luck.|`|C75EsUXRaa	if its suddenly appeared overnight, then I suspect it is an abcess until you can get to the vets, I would reccommend you start bathing it with some 'warm'not hot - salty water, even if it comes to a head and bursts he still will probably need antibiotics if its as large as you intimate, don't ignore it, they can turn nasty.|`|FdnShJn9aa	Ok, here are your choices    Go to the vet and either have surgery or have him put to sleep    or    Watch him die at home.    That simple.
8NSh1D4Maa	'Teacup' is a term used by unscrupulous breeders to get people to shell out loads of money for unhealthy runts.  It's not a regulated term at all.  As far as your dog's adult size, I would guess that she will far exceed the breed standard maximum (which is 6 pounds).  Your boyfriend got taken for a ride, since not only will she not be smaller than average, she'll likely be quite large for a Chihuahua.  She will keep growing until probably a year old (she'll be almost full height at 7 months or so, but will keep filling out after that).  My Min Pin was under 4 pounds at 4 months, and is now 9.5 at almost full size.  Expect yours to probably end up around 10 pounds.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	No such thing as a teacup. If she's 4 months old and already 4 lbs, wow!  I think she'll be topping the acceptable weight limit.  I'm thinking maybe 8 lbs when grown. I have 4 chis and they're usually done growing at about 8 months. Any growing after that is usually fat, so don't overfeed her.<br>  Min Pins are not the same breed and don't mature or fill out the same. 10 lbs is pretty standard in that breed.<br>  <br>  <br>  One more thing, don't ever buy a pup from someone that would let it go at 6 weeks! Chis usually nurse for about 9 - 10 weeks.|`|2821e642f26e1d2d0daab24df234f001aa	There is no such thing as a teacup anything, it is just a term that some so called breeders use to try and get more money for a pup from people that don't know any different.  Chihuahuas are one of the smaller breeds which are only ideally supposed to be around 3 - 6 lbs full grown.  I'm guessing yours will be at least 6 lbs (if not more) full grown if she is already 4 lbs at just 4 mo. old.  Most small dogs reach their adult size at about 10 - 12 mo. (sometimes a little sooner)|`|JaFbuUUWaa	People who sell chihuahua's as 'teacups' are usually just selling a runt dog or inbred of 2 unnaturally small dogs, they aren't actually a breed. I have heard of dogs being the runt of the litter and ending up being the biggest full grown of all the pups. So this may be your situation. A chihuahua should weigh about 6 lbs. full grown and doesn't have nearly the health problems a 'teacup' version would. She will stop growing in height about 8 months - a year and then fill out for about 6 months after that I believe.|`|aFURblhdaa	a "teacup" isnt a breed.... its just a really small dog that people gave that name so they could sell them for more (like those "designer breeds" such as a maltipoo or puggle- which i think is horrible and disgraceful to breed mutts when there are so many out there now that need homes) but if shes already 4 pounds at 4 monthes old thats no teacup... she may even get to be 6-8 pounds which is actually on the bigger end for ANY chihuahua.... i have a long haired chihuahua and she is just that (not a teacup!) but she only weighs 3 1/2 pounds and she is already a year old.... so i think you guys may have gotten jipped...<br>  <br>  dogs are usually physically mature by one year of age... as far as how big they will get|`|CuGT5X6eaa	"teacups"are the runts (it just sounds better if its not the word RUNT) you must be taking good care of her for her to be that big,don't buy teacup pets they are poor quality and die easily DO NOT BREED HER! she is almost if not all the way guaranteed to die if you do...|`|XKrt5j4yaa	There is no such thing as a "teacup" anything.<br>  <br>  They are poorly bred dogs that don't get to the standard breed size.<br>  <br>  Look them up on the AKC website and see what you find.

kOEX3MRraa	oil them with Leather New (by Farnam). it keeps them supple and softens them right up, it does temporarily darken them but the dark shade will fade out within a few uses. It will give your leather a nice gloss without the greasy feel, and its perfect for breaking leather in! Then when you clean them, use Leather CPR, it works great! it is an all in one cleaner and conditioner, just put it on your leather and leave it for about a minute or two, then wipe it off and buff it, it softens up your leather right away, and makes it extremly supple, even the most cracked and worn leather will soften up!! if your chaps get wet, use Leather CPR, it prevents your leather from drying out and cracking.

owLAmQqjaa	Technically, you could. They make ones that are the perfect size, but accidents can happen, so I would advise against using one. Hedgehog toes are the perfect size to fit through the teensy little air holes and they can then get ripped off or broken which causes considerable pain to the hedgehog and bleeding that could cause even greater problems. The ventilation is also very poor and this would make it very uncomfortable for the hedgehog.<br>  <br>  I spent $25 on a giant hamster ball, then I got it home and took it out of the box. Then I realized how small the holes were, so I didn't use it with any of my hedgehogs. This was unfortunate, because the ball probably would keep the hedgehog out of trouble while they are exploring, but their life is more important to me than my own convenience.|`|fSulSn3Saa	try it. <br>  <br>  if it likes it then sure. <br>  <br>  if it doesnt or poops or pees then take it out and comfort it. <br>  it should be fine.  <br>  [[make sure the ball is big enough. hedghogs are generally larger then hamsters.]]|`|P34HxZIZaa	LOL<br>  <br>  Good fun.

IgcHVMmbaa	Sounds normal to me. I assume you're feeding dry? Honestly, wet is much healthier for cats so I'd recommend switching. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/</a>  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canned_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bpo_ch4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...</a><br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...</a><br>  |`|RVicFEyFaa	Kittens still have what is called milk teeth (baby teeth) until six months of age. You don't say if your feeding him wet or dry food, as I would be concerned dry food could be a choking hazard if he's not chewing. It could be that his adult teeth are still pushing out & he's having some discomfort or inability to chew at this time.

nFcl0BOsaa	Going out with another dog is not enough.  All living creatures have the instinct to escape -- to not be confined. Regardless of how big your backyard is, a fence is still confinement. Furthermore, dogs have an instinct for migration, that is the instinct to walk. Repair the fence AND start taking your dogs for a nice, long daily walk -- preferably first thing in the morning. That's how wild canines start their day; it's instinct. A dog who can can count on a daily walk is much less likely to try to escape the confinement of home and yard on his own.  And if he's not neutered, get him neutered.<br>  <br>  Running around the yard is not enough mental stimulation, and it doesn't satisfy the instinct to walk. How would you like it if you rarely got to leave your home and yard? Or if you had no idea when you'd ever get to go anywhere? It would be like being locked up.|`|7Sf8VD85aa	I would put the dog on a running lead or long line and train it with top notch treats (chicken, low fat sausage etc) to come as soon as called for a reward. I would make a game of it and always reward the dog.<br>  The long line should give the dog enough space but not allow it near the fence. <br>  Also a run in the yard with another dog in no way compensates the dog for a couple of good long off lead runs with plenty of recalls. Check out the fact sheets on the Alpha dog web site.|`|aOIXGl2vaa	More love and attention is the answer...

I am guessing that because she can slip under the fence, it is made of something like wire. Buying a good fence will make all the difference and just to be sure of no escapes, fill in UNDER the fence too with what is called a rat wall.<br>  <br>  Just for other things that may happen, like this, you need to get your come more strong and confident. "Come" is one of the most IMPORTANT commands with owning a dog. It will come is handy MANY times and can even be life saving!|`|bH1DYr5saa	You need to exercise him more regularly. Running around in the yard doesn't count as it's not very stimulating for the dog. If he escapes everytime you let him out for the toilet then you need to get a new fence, or go out with him on a leash. |`|1592c885f8b61569e0e0bc02442d574caa	If he still has his boy bits then he could possibly be looking for a girlfriend!<br>  Get him castrated..may calm him down..had a dog like that myself many years ago and he fathered 26 puppies that i knew about it one year..his bits went and he stayed!|`|jFIH3BShaa	well i would suggest getting that crazy mexican dog trainer in to teach it a lession lol but seriously i would suggest some kind of training lol|`|ARBY5Hccaa	obviously tha luv & attn is not enuff|`|N2JkgQ4Uaa	Do you walk him twice a day?|`|MKUc98eHaa	gave favorite food to your dog|`|af0N5kY8aa	If at all possible fix the fence. Try chicken wire pushed deep down into the ground and far enough up the fence he can't pull it back down. If that isn't possible try staying outside with him while he does his business. Keep a high value treat in your hand and call him back to you when he starts trying to escape. I know it sucks to stay out in the cold, but sometimes we have to do things we don't like. Also, may not be fun but WALK your dog. Yeahy, playing in the yard is great fun but they also need structured exercise. I am not saying go for a 3 mile walk but at least 20 minutes a day would help. Good luck and I hope this helped a bit.

They do have a musky smell, but regular bathing and keeping their litter box clean solves that problem.     If you want a fun pet, that is easily carried and loves to snuggle, but which also can be kept in a cage in your bedroom so it doesn't take over the whole house, then a ferret is a great choice.    If the smell is a big issue, try getting a rat.

29ec6394821e99613460db15778e7787aa	Do you not provide a salt water source? All Land Hemrits must have marine/oceanic water too.. both water sources must be de-chlorinated and not tap water. Does he have a place to hide and climb? Also what foods do you offer him to eat? What is the temperature and humidity of the tank?    If you continue to handle him the stress will eventually lead to his demise... a Land Hermit Crab must have time to de-stress after we bring them home and also in order for him to thrive and be active you must have more than one crab or then again he will eventually die.    He is under post-purchase stress and he needs time 2 weeks or more to properly aclimate to his surroundings. Allow him to dig and do whatever he wants without being disturbed.. but do not expect him to be too active as long as he is in there alone.    The reason why he gets active in a shoe box is because of the stress he wants to be able to relax. This is the problem many people face they assume Hermit Crabs are exciting active creatures but number one they are nocturnal, number two they are not a pet/pet meaning they do not enjoy being handled too much and they need very specific tank conditions and without that they will die.    Here are the beginner tips for you taken from our site...  Land Hermit Crabs are portrayed as easy to care for, cheap and novelty pets. This is not really true! There are some basics that you need to know before actually buying your first Hermit Crabs. Read on below and then you can decide if this is the pet for you.        Sea sponges:             Natural, un-bleached and un-dyed sea sponges only. Non-man made. These can be found in pet stores and in some department stores as well.            They need to be rinsed and dried to keep bacteria and uglies away, so have an extra or two so you can rotate them. Boiling will also sterilize them.  Thermometer and Hygrometer:                  Land Hermit Crabs, breathe through modified gills therfore they must have the proper humidty in order to breathe as well as the proper temperatre in order to thrive.                 You need to monitor all of the tank conditions. One for the temp and one for the humidity will get you started. Keep them as close to substrate level as possible since that is where the crabs are most of the time.              76 - 80 degrees and everyone will be fine. Do not allow the Hermit Crabs to get cold for long periods or they can die. Humidity ranges should be around 76-80% relative, sustained.                 With in these levels your crabs  and their home will be a happy and active one. If it gets too warm, you can always prop up the lid, same if the humidity gets too high, prop the lid up.To add moisture/humidity add an extra moist sponge or even a bubbler in their water dish.       Housing:             Glass tank with lid (aquarium with glass lid is best) Can use a quality Kritter Keeper with saran wrap over the lid.  Substrate:             Options include... Calci-Sand, Sterilized playsand, Aragonite Sand, Moist coco-fiber bedding, Crushed coral.        You can mix and match, have seperate areas and containers, it is up to you. Remember there needs to be enough substrate to fully cover the "floor" or the tank. Deep enough for your largest crab to fully submerse or cover it's self. The substrate also needs to be pretty smooth, meaning little to no jaged edges to scrape or injure the Hermit Crabs Exoskeleton prior to, during and after molting.  It also must be insect and chemical free. Human or animal grade not the kind that is used for construction or masonry.  Light:         Hermit Crabs require 12 hours of sunlight each day. This can be a combo of natural and artificial light. The normal aquarium hood light can be good enough.       Once you are ready to get more advanced or need more heating you can buy a bi-light that has both dayglo and nightglo bulbs.. for heat and light during the day and heat during the night. Always try to have full spectrum when possible so the Hermit Crabs get enough of the proper lighting.             Water basics:             Use only de-chlorinated or bottled water for everything Hermit Crabs related. The chemicals in tap water (chlorine and heavy metals are toxic to Hermit Crabs also will burn their modified gills.)             You can treat tap water by using a water conditioner for fish, make sure their drinking water doesn't have stress-coat in it though.             Land Hermit Crabs must have both fresh and salt water for drinking. The salt should be obtained from a good aquarium store or pet department, reading the directions carefully.            The fresh water should be de-chlorinated as well. Both dishes should be deep enough for your largest Hermit Crab to fully submerse it's self, while at the same time provide items like shells, smooth stones for your smaller crabs to use to get in and out of the water. One or both water sources can have bubblers or sponges, it is up to you.    Misting Bottle:           Have one ready if your humidity drops, or to spot clean a crab who you want to play with, or to physically check. You can also have a second one with fresh salt water to control mold and fungus. This water also must be de-chlorinated and Hermie Safe.    Food:         Provide a nice selection of fresh and dried foods daily. Fresh foods can stay for 24 hours or less only because of mold and spoilage. Dried foods can stay for 2 or 3 days as long as you monitor it carefully.         Rotate food selection so that you crabs do not get bored and live a more natural scavenger type life. Check out our food lists.          Heating:           Land Hermit Crabs live in tropical areas, there for it is quite warm and humid. First there is the heat. Sometimes the lights you use give off a fair amount of heat, yet that does not rea|`|933bdf878ffd023e198e7157fec7d726aa	switch back to soil substrate and put a larger shell in the tank it might be time for it to change|`|AA11409431	If you wanted a more active pet, try getting a fish.

Nine time out of ten they are not 'nasties', but there's always a chance it could be, and it's by far better to be certain it's an 'okay' one.|`|Y89Y34sFaa	i am sorry i think you should take her to the vet|`|236ec04bbd4131ca8c28403df2b8717caa	My friend's shelty had that also.  His was just fatty tissue.  The vet eventually had to remove it because it got so big, almost the size of a baseball.  I don't think it was a health hazard to him, but the vet wanted to get rid of it because of its size.    My miniature dachshund now has two on her chest.  Both are small in size, but due to their location, our vet won't mess with them unless they keep growing.      It's best to have your vet take a look at them just to be on the safe side.  If they turn out to be more than just fatty tissues, your vet will discuss further treatment with you.|`|1w19Dmqraa	I don't mean to scare you but it might be a tumer or skin cancer you should really get a vet to see it! :(|`|OWwejzg3aa	I have a question for you...if there was a large lump on your stomach what would you do?  Go to a doctor????  Then you should take the dog to a vet!|`|XBiCtehKaa	this is very serous if it starts to get red it is deadly you need to get this dog checked immediately|`|Ms3GoGe2aa	No one on the web should diagnose this!      Go to a vet!|`|KqNy8dHXaa	it could be a tumor or some kind of cancer. if you ask me, go see a vet as soon as possible.|`|gQwy4j06aa	It is best to have a Vet take a look at things like this.  It could be nothing, or it could be something that needs to be fixed right away.   If the Vets office is closed today because it's Saturday, then be sure and call for an appointment first thing Monday.
ZNDqYUwkaa	It's good that you are getting her checked over by another vet and until then, stick with the aspirin to relieve her pain.    I would imagine, from the additional information you have given that she may have slightly jarred her back, pulled muscles or bruised herself.    If she's showing no signs of improvement when you go to the other vet, tell them you want her to have her back checked properly as anything muscle related should have started easing after 7 days.    Good luck and make sure she gets plenty of rest.|`|4f28b4094a6709e18a06d875e2ffb0c9aa	get a second opinion,but we would need to know far more than what you told us here. like do you know for sure she is 8? how long has this been a problem? did it come on slow or just in a few days?   in two weeks you should see a difference if aspirin is going to help.  my big concern is that she may well be 16 not 8, not much else to say with the little info we have here..always try another vet if you did not hear what you wanted from the first one.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	Keep an eye on the dog, try to see if any activity makes her worse, or when it's better. A friend of mine just found out what has been bothering her dog off and on for a few years. He's 9 now. He limps if he gets too much activity, and all along they figured it was arthritis in the shoulder. My friend moved lately, and almost by chance her new vet discovered it was arthritis all right, but in his foot. It can be tricky to find these things in dogs since they can't tell you where it hurts.
nmkgd7luaa	Was it green or was there green in it? It could be she just ate something she shouldn't have. My dog used to eat crayons and have crayon pieces in his poop.|`|gwUMipsUaa	She may have gotten into something that was green.  My first three dogs ate Purina, and had nothing wrong with their poop.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	Purina is not a good dog food, try Solid Gold for puppies, or Innova.|`|D2sMKkchaa	Maybe the food was too rich for her tummy,or if you give it her daily then she may have Diarrhoea I would insist going back to the vet.  Good Luck,  Clarice.

OYFu9Jrmaa	mix vinegar with her soap unless u wanna try tomato juice  plzzzz answer mine|`|tyvFUPOxaa	Go to your local pets mart or veterinarian's office to get a special shampoo for pets that get sprayed by skunks... Nothing else you do will help... This happened to my sister's black haired version of Benji and it did work... And do not mistreat your pet, your dog is more miserable about this than you are.|`|L22hVXTIaa	BEEN THERE!!!  UGH!!!  My little Chi, Harley, got sprayed this last June - at around 1:30 in the morning.  We had just returned from a camping trip and were letting everyone out to potty just before bed and WHAM!!  He got it right in the face.  Then, my husband was trying to grab him (he was scared) and he ran in the house!  So, the whole house wreaked!  I had to find an all night drug store, bought some peroxide and mixed it with water and baking soda, also tried tomato juice.  It worked, sort of.  Next morning I went to Petco and bought the actual de-skunker stuff which worked much better.  But, you could still smell it slightly for about a week.  I feel sorry for you!|`|NLcEHqEqaa	bathe him in hydrogen peroxide. works great!|`|8TLCxEJzaa	hahahhahahah not the first time i heard of it. My chihuahua got "skunked" by about 10 skunks at once! She thought they were squirrels. I had to buy 20 cans of tomato sauce to get the stink out. She had to stay in there for a while (10 hours actually) I t was really hard getting the stink out. Then I had to wash the tomato with shampoo and water.|`|v0RtQKrGaa	try to give it a tomato juice bath it works really well i use it all the time|`|AA11244754	the best remedy for that is tomato juice (or if you don't have any but do have ketchup water that down) and bathe your pet in that.  There is something in tomatoes that cuts the smell of skunk and it will do it the first time out.  But you will have to buy your dog a new collar or harness since the smell is in it and it will never come out.  You can remove the tags though and put on the new collar and harness.  The tomato juice (a big can of it) should be less expensive than that special shampoo..|`|b4R0Ww9Haa	I've heard bathing an animal in tomato juice...not V8...helps.|`|FrECDwHfaa	ive only heard of tomato juice and she/he may have to get shaved, my friends dog had to get shaved and it worked,,,|`|N9VN9bwfaa	I've heard of many "cures" for this -- buy commercial deodorizing shampoos made for skunk spray, use tomato juice, use baby shampoo, use plain water, use oatmeal -- but when my sister's dog was sprayed, she said that nothing really fixed the problem but time.  Just keep bathing and bathing with everything.  Eventually that stink will have to go away.  I don't know what else to suggest except maybe a clothespin on your nose!  Good luck!|`|0bYcYz2jaa	Consult a vet first.  The only working remedies I know of for skunk stink are tomato juice or a combination of baking soda and peroxide.  Ask a vet first to make sure these are usable on dogs because I've only seen the tomato juice used on an animal.  Lots and lots of bathing might help too.|`|FewhKlx9aa	This is awful.I had this happen to a 6lb pekingese I had that grabbed onto the backend of the skunk and squirted her down the throat..We bathed her with everything and anything and it was impossible to get rid of..Then when the smell started to get better on her fur she would belche all the time and the smell of skunk was enough to make ya sick..The fact there was nothing you could pour down her throat we just had to wait it out..About a good 6mo's|`|QjoWA99Yaa	She needs about 50 baths and possibly her fur shaving.|`|HmkCFddAaa	There is a shampoo out now for skunk sprays. Can't think of the name right off hand. Your local pet store should carry it. Tomato juice will help some. But  just so you know even the shampoo won't get rid of all the odor they will still smell some when they get wet till it all wears off. Have had to do it for my dogs too. My short haired dogs got rid of the smell first. It took a little longer for the long haired one to get completly rid of it. I did not shave her. Just bathed her a couple of times and let the rest wear off
Z0v6G0Kgaa	1.  You can't tell if it's a pure-bred or mixed breed dog based on appearances so the people insisting "it's a mutt" are just being obnoxious.    2.  Hard to tell from the pictures because they're a bit fuzzy and I don't have something to relate the size too.    I personally think it's a rat terrier--a bit overweight--but a rat terrier.  Let me tell you why:  --USMC wife is correct that it does look like a rat terrier but they don't usually come in those colors.  Most are what are called "tuxedo" (which is white and black with a few hints of tan).  But my rattie is almost a dead ringer for the colors in the picture.  --Rat terriers are often mistaken for jack russells/JRTs/PRTs.  But if you look at them closely there are big differences in appearance (let alone in temperament).  A rat terrier has a shorter coat and is almost bald on the bell.  JRTs have much more facial hair (where ratties have incredibly fine, short hair on the face and especially around the nose).  JRTs have a much squarer muzzle (and ratties have a tapered nose).  A rat terrier that is in good shape looks the body of a greyhound put in a trash compactor:  big chest, no belly what-so-ever, all muscle and tendon.  JRTs have more of a square body shape.  Rat terriers have longer legs than do JRTs--JRTs were bred to go underground after foxes so you want a smaller chest and shorter legs so they don't get caught in the tunnel.  --for those saying it looks like a beagle mix or a greyhound mix, the original rat terriers were a combination of manchester terrier and black & white terrier (now extinct) that American farmers mixed in some beagle (for nose) and sighthound (greyhound and whippet) for agility and eyesight/reaction to small movement as well as speed and corgi (for modest herding ability).  --the ears:  most rat terriers have ears that are erect most of the time (like a corgi's or minpins) though some do have button ears.  JRTs rarely have erect ears and they're usually smaller than a rat terrier's.    3.  There are several million great dogs out there, at least 2-3 million of them in shelters or rescues awaiting someone like your boyfriend.  I'm posted links to two reputable rat terrier rescues that are national.  Look at the dogs posted.  If they match the picture of your dog, you probably have a rat terrier.  Then the rescue groups will work with you to find a rat terrier who's temperament is a good fit for your boyfriend and his situation.    4.  It's easy for ratties to get overweight.  Like all dogs they scavenge.  They're very quick to grab snacks and dropped food.  They're quick to chomp out of other pets bowls (even cats or other species).  And they're smart (so they will snack out of the popcorn or chip bowl when you aren't looking).  Get that dog on a diet!  Set aside the correct portion of food and then don't over-treat--treats have to come out of the food portion.  To give you an example, my rat terrier (who would qualify as a big miniature, not quite big enough for standard) is 15 inches at the whithers/shoulders and weighs 17-18 pounds.  Get your active (I do agility with my rattie, I know other people who do rally-0, earthdog, dock dog and flyball with rat terriers).  You'll find that the more active you get with your rattie, the better behaved, the more content it becomes.  These are smart dogs, quick to learn, that love to please and do best when they have a job that makes them think.|`|3giaPYe8aa	It's not a breed...it's a mutt, and a fat one at that.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Can't see it's face so it's hard to tell but I would guess Jack Russell or Jack Russell mix.|`|vPde97E2aa	Do *NOT* pay some CROOK for a MUTT/MONGREL.!!

Good Luck!!! :)    Yours Truly,  GymGirl1998**|`|VtHvcEtuaa	Very hard to tell from that angle, but I would say from that picture alone a Jack Russell/Beagle mix    Just to add- Dogs are not gifts or presents.  Your boyfriend should want this dog and know that he is getting it.    If your boyfriend wants a dog then that is great.  I only say that because many time people get dogs as gifts and are not ready for one and the dog ends up in a shelter.  Please if you do get a dog, try to adopt http://www.petfinder.com|`|aD1no2cWaa	It looks like some sort of Jack Russel mix. It could be a Basenji or Minature Pinscher mix also.    -Erin|`|laF0ieR3aa	I think it's either a Terrier /Grey hound Mix  or a beagle/jack russel|`|LfZk2NGBaa	Looks like a rat terrier to me. You normally don't see them in those colors. But at the same time he has the body language of a rat terrier.|`|AA11553328	It appears to be mainly Jack Russell. But if you want to give him this kind of dog be advised that they are extremely hyper. He may not want such a handful!|`|1w19Dmqraa	The picture isn't that clear but I think it has just a Corgi/Jack Russel mix. the shape of the body is like a Corgi, and colors look like a Jack Russell.

If you're getting it for your boyfriend you should let him see the dog first and know if he likes it or not.
AA10972643	You need to read up on Chinchillas.  They are very unique animals.  Their fur is considered the softest fur, and they have needs such as dust baths, special chinchilla-safe foods.  They need space to run around in, like a spare room where we keep ours.  He gets to run around the room for a couple hours each day.       The best way to describe them is a mix between a squirrel (they can jump and climb) and a rabbit-soft and furry.       Not suggested for a family with small children...for some are know to "nibble" a finger just to see what it is, not to hurt you.  It's a way of sniffing you.      We are having alot of fun with ours.  He likes to sit on our lap, sit on our shoulders, and is very, very curious!      you may consider finding your chinchilla on www.petfinder.com and go to small and furry section    These people knows these animals very well, and just need to find a home for them....good luck!|`|9ac600fec1a3904983c1ea081242ed14aa	No Ive heard they are difficult and have some weird needs|`|959809e9cd1618776c6b264f98790f24aa	Chinchillas are soft, playful, and VERY intelligent for the type of animal they are. They make excellent pets, so long you know how to take care of them...  -You have to give them dust baths every other day at the least. It cleans their fur. One should NEVER bathe chinchillas in water- ever. It makes their hair fall and can give them a fungal fur infection. In some cases, this can kill them. They will not make good pets for you if you are sensitve to their dust baths.    -The temperature must not exceed 80 degrees- ever. Chinchillas' coats are very think. They originate from cold weather. Making the temperature high will kill them. This is unfortanelty how mine died. You HAVE to be careful.    Other than those two facts, chinchillas are fairly easy to take care of. Clean the cage twice a week, but they are pretty clean. Handle them /gently/. These rodents are 'fragile', and it would be horrible to let a small child have one if they don't know how soft they should handle it. They do not bite for the heck of it at all. They WILL, however, bite you if you corner them. Except to get a soft 'nibble' the first few days, though. No need to mistake this as aggression. Here's a fact- males are usualy smaller than females.|`|37b3b142e70e7a217bbe2baa2ffed13eaa	what is it!!!????|`|AA10937834	ima go w/ what just me said|`|ddd8a02a3c601b8d4924618da20bf8dcaa	i consider getting a guinea pig!   they are the cutest they dont die easily, dont make lots of noise, easy to take care of, dont bite, and super super cute.  and i dont know much about cihincillas but the frst thing i heard was that they bite. *ouch.|`|778827aa11aaa1341c23ec56d63c39bcaa	They are VERY easy!

I'm not sure where you live but we always bought ducklings from local farmers. Hopefully this is possible where you live. This way you'll be able to buy just one or two and not have to order a crate of 20 or something :)    As has been said already, make sure you know how to care for ducklings, though I trust you've already read up loads about them. I had ducklings when I was little and they're amazing and quite easy to look after if you have the right resources. The food isn't that expensive either - you can get an entire sack of duckling feed very cheaply at a farming supplies centre (not sure what they're called in the UK).

Like   go on many walks together  when your dog goes outside go with her  feed her (instead of using an automatic feeder or let someone else do it)  play with her a lot  when she pees in the house dont yell at her but just ignore her  give her lots of affection    these things make her feel like you care for her and you want to be her owner.     hope i helped!|`|LByxVGYCaa	train her, walk her, take her places...|`|LqSciCrhaa	Hey man way too much info.

4R34sXT2aa	Bonsoir,    Effectivement pourquoi pas les 2. Tout en sachant qu'il y aura double frais de vtrinaire pour les vaccins, le tatouage et la strilisation. Pourquoi la strilisation, pour viter les naissances indsirables et limiter ainsi les ventuels abandons, mais aussi pour les protger. En effet, si vos chats ont accs  l'extrieur ils encourent le risque d'attraper des maladies contagieuses, comme le sida du chat pour lequel il n'y a pas de vaccin et dont l'issue est fatale. En plus cette opration a une grande chance de leur viter certaines autres maladies, comme un cancer des glandes mammaires (chez la chatte). S'ils vos chats restent  l'intrieur, il faut tout de mme les vacciner pour les protger de virus plus volatile (qui se propagent dans l'air) comme le coryza. L'utilit d'une strilisation est moins d'actualit mais ncessaire, si vous voulez viter le marquage du territoire (en quelque sorte des pipis partout).    Sinon le siamois est un chat superbe avec temprament trs bavard (vous vous en rendrez compte si vous ne faites pas oprer cette petite boule de poils), c'est un chat qui aime la compagnie et supporte difficilement de rester seul trop longtemps (donc l'ide de 2 chatons est bonne)    Le chat isabel n'est pas une race, contrairement au siamois. C'est une couleur de robe, gnralement des taches blanches, rousses et noires. On appelle galement cette couleur de robe caille de tortue ou tricolore.    Si vous n'avez pas trop l'habitude des chats, 1 seul chaton pour commencer. Plus tard, peut-tre, vous pourrez prendre le second. En revanche, si vous avez l'habitude des chats, les deux en mme temps c'est bien car ils se tiendront compagnie et pourront tre des amis pour la vie.    J'espre que ces informations complmentaires vous seront utiles et vous souhaite une excellente nuit.|`|HYj2xTYaaa	moi je te conseillerai un siamois, mais je ne peut pas choisir  ta place, maintenant c'est  toi d'essayer de voir devant lequel tu a l'impression que tu  besoin de celui-l.

898f20a257695abc9115e62cda6828e3aa	Get a flashlight and look up the nasal passages of the dog and see if you see any dirt or debris in the nose.  It may have gotten something up there and can't dislodge it.  It may also be getting a cold and it's sinuses are itching.  Check it out for yourself and then give it a day to see if it stops on its own.  If not, then take it to the vet.

AA11930013	She will be very restless,  she wont be able to get comfortable no matter how she lays or sits.    She will probably want to crawl under something and hide.  They like to be in a small quite spot to have their babies.  If you have not gotten her a bed ready to have her babies in you need to get one as soon as possible.  The cheapest, quickest bed is a cardboard box with newspapers in the bottom.  She will want to tear up the papers and fix the bed for the babies.  Some people say leave them alone and let nature handle it....I disagree,  if you are not sure she is in labor or not I take it you have never been through a labor.  I hope this is not her first litter.   There are several signs you will need to watch for,  she may have all of them or only a few.  She will be very restless, cant get comfortable.  She will dig and scratch all in her bed.  She will pant like she is hot or run a long way.  She will shiver like she is freezing (while panting at the same time)  Just before babies arrive she will have contractions,  you will actually see the muscles in her stomach push (like she has to poo really bad)  IF SHE HAS HARD CONTRACTIONS LONGER THAN 2 HOURS GO TO THE VET THE BABY MAY BE STUCK.  As a precaution I would call the vets now to find out who is on call in case she has any trouble and you have to rush her to the vet.

AA12113105	Its easy! After you have taught him to lie down, then the funny part is to teach him to rollover. Makes me laugh all the time:    Here's how to teach your dog to lie down:      ? Have your dog sit or stand. Let your dog sniff a treat you are holding, but don't let him have it.    ? Lower the treat to the floor, and as you are doing that, your dog should follow it down.     ? Be sure to say "lie down" as your dog begins to lower himself.     ? Your dog should lower himself all the way to the floor.     ? Only give him the treat once he is on the floor. Repeat the words "Lie Down" many times: Say, "Good boy, lie down. Lie down you good boy."     ? Practice this several times during the day and over several days.|`|AA10476903	Try snapping your fingers down by the floor and pat. Have a treat and see if that works. It worked for me.

If he still stands help him into the laying down position. Give him the treat.  Repeat over and over, until he does it alone.  (always give a treat for proper behavior). :) Good luck!|`|ca1058273ea97064e9abd92af7530469aa	When I had puppies, I lured them down with a treat. They followed the treat, and the command was added. This didn't work with a dog I kept over the summer.  Two dog trainers told and showed me how to wrestle him, fairly unsuccessfully, to the ground.  I was told, now you know why it's easier to train a puppy.  I researched on the web (not this site), and tried clicker method they described.  (Clickers are cheap; people keep giving me these.)  I sat on the floor with really good treats in one hand, near the ground, and a clicker in the other.  He and I sat looking at each other, then he spied the treats and collapsed to the floor for a closer investigation.  I clicked and gave him a treat.  He thought this was so cool, that he wanted to do this over and over.  Next, I put command word to this and I used hand signal, pointing direction down.  Soon after, when he wanted a treat, he'd plop to the floor and look imploringly at me. (He only got the treat when on command, though)  We were quickly working on  lengthening the duration of his down, by clicking and treating at ever longer intervals from his performing the action.  Pretty soon the previous owner, who gave him up, showed up, and I showed him his new trick of "spin".  Then, I put him in a down, and did something with my own dog.  The owner was still staring at his dog, in shock that the dog he'd trained well for some things, had finally learned "down".|`|458677a73d15776f51b73f99b0e8e35aaa	you should hire a dog trainer they would teach the dog some tricks so he might win a dog competition.

6a15e3808f08ae0fa4d60379ad941b21aa	Get him moving really good and then just keep walking.  The dog needs to move past the shiney floor problem.  Keep him going forward, even if you feel you are dragging him.  Giving him treats while he is freaking out is only making him think that freaking out is ok.  Once on the floor, stop and let him deal with it a while then keep him moving forward.  Be calm and don't get him all excited.  Good luck.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	He's afraid of slipping.  Are his nails too long?  If so, that will make him more afraid of slipping.    You can try Cesar's methods, but if you have the patience I'd do something less drastic first with this young dog.  Put down some throw rugs and walk him in normally a few times.  Then try running him in.  Then take out 1 of the rugs so he's taking a couple of steps on the floor without really realizing it until he's done it.  Increase the distance gradually - depending on how he does.    Do not coax or give treats to try to get him to walk on the floor - you're reinforcing his belief that he should be afraid.  Give him treats and lots of over-the-top praise for taking a step or two on the floor and I think he'll overcome his fear quickly.  You have to try to kind of trick him into it in the beginning; with repetition he should forget to be afraid and see nothing's going to happen to him.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	You are right, it is his footing.  He needs to be lead over different surfaces so that he is not afraid of a slippery floor.      With the dog on a leash have the owner sit just inside the door and let the dog stay out side.  Have the owner pet and admire other dogs loud enough so that his dog can hear him.  Keeping his voice sweet and inviting and soothing.  When the dog outside wines or scratches at the door give him an opportunity to enter.     He may choose not to come in, but is OK because he will be given many opportunities to enter.  When he does it will be HIS choice.  Then just let the owner and the dog sit there.  Let other dogs come up to say hi and the other dogs will help him get used to his footing.  Don't make him get out on the floor, for the time being he has done a great deed and sitting there is a little scary.    You will have to do this in small steps and let him make the choice but make it very very inviting and worthy and interesting.  Praise him ! ! ! !  It will take a quite a few trips to earn his trust.      Good luck,  I hope I was able to help  You can contact me for more specific information.  You are a trainer, think like a elephant on ice.  Put something on the pads of his feet to help with grip,  have him walk over a piece of flooring (several steps),    Look at it like little duckling taking their first swim.  Mom goes in first and one by one the little ducklings join her but there is always one little guy that is scared to death to jump.  Mama can't entice him in, his siblings can't get through to him,  they call and call and soon the little guy jumps out to be with the others.    Time, behavior modification and reasurance will bring him around.|`|ba2d83f102eb97351a54efd2a4bfdaeaaa	First, a lot of idiots are going to suggest Cesar's methods, which are to force him to walk on the floor. AVOID THOSE!     Try getting a carpet runner, something that changes the texture of the floor. See if he'll walk on that. As he gains confidence, you can start moving it so that more and more of the floor is exposed. Enough to challenge the dog, but not enough to cause him to refuse.|`|348e5850151e1b0fd89d3ec5faec79cfaa	My freinds dog is just like this.  It mihgt be what your you are cleaning the floor with.

61aac4f5048106f1ce66f7f66b50b228aa	I'm dealing with it too and it's a long road.    My 11 month old Chessie mix has Demodex mange and is on her 4th Mitoban dip next week,    { she was scraped and still showed mites this week near the base of the tail } but she has improved so much, the vet is even suprised at how good she looks. Her fur is growing back beautifully and the dark spots are going away and a new skin is emerging. Its costing us a fortune though every 10 -12 days, $92.00 for the dip at the vets office, doggie day care fee and the scraping! Its worth it, I love her.      I have done alot of research on mange and learned that the immune system is compromised in dogs with mange so a healing from the inside out  is needed so I made some other changes in my dogs diet that have helped her in her recovery, I'm sure its working with the way my vet looked when she saw Brandy on Monday, her eyes lit up in amazement  at her progress!!    I changed her dry food to Natural Balance Duck & Potato "Hypoallergenic" dog food and removed all the junk food from her diet including commerically made doggie treats { that was hard at first }. I add in rotation to her dog food the following,    keep in mind she weighs 85 pds.  3-4 TBS of can pink salmon -skin/coat/omega3  3-4 TBS of plain yogurt- as a probiotic/digestion  1/2 cup of WHITE rice-easy on her tummy after Mitoban dips mixed with   1/2 cup of chunked chicken breast    6-8ish  carrots/ frozen veggie of choice-no corn- organic baby peeled carrots you can feed these as snacks or shred in food  ***In addition I also give her 2 dog vitamins daily and 2 -- 500mg vitamin C daily.      Its working. I would call around to your local vet and ask some questions before you set up an appointment and ask what their preferred treatment for mange is and try to find one willing to try something else for your dog. Money doesnt grow on trees.  Below are several links to good information on dealing with mange that I really  found helpful..  HANG IN THERE  ** I know the dips are poisonous but what are the options, really? I want her to get better, bottom line.|`|1ce2270f846511c49f8bba8fb58167dcaa	poor dog.     If the mange really is uncurable, it is better to put your dog down, so it doesnt suffer.  Even if it doesn't show signs of pain, it is very painful for your dog.    Good luck at the next vet.|`|1q1fbdw4aa	I found a really good company who specializes in Mange a while back when I needed help.  They are called PetsBestRx.  They have an exceptional staff who are very knowledgeable on the different kinds of mange and they work with you until the mange it actually gone.    They also work with your vet if you would like.  I bought their immune boosters and their mange kit.  My dog was pretty bad off and had a lot of infection.  I highly recommend this company and their products.  They helped me out tremendously on more than one occassion.    www.petsbestrx.com/mange        1-866-314-8917|`|23a9a397ca0d0ff6f0dae262ba570eecaa	First,you need to find out if this is sarcoptic or demodex mange. Demodex is not contagious. The only "cure" for it is to get the immune system back to where it should be with proper nutrition and a stress free environment. Sarcoptic mange is contagious and requires meds and lots of time as well as a high quality diet and stress free environment. Be careful of any dips such as Mitoban as this is somewhat toxic and does stress the dogs immune system even more. I would get a second vet opinion-definitely. Good luck
4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	The vet didn't believe you????? Get yourself a new vet pronto. She is sick and could be dehydrated. Check this:  Signs of Dehydration:  - Pinch a little skin between your thumb and forefinger on your dog's back.  When you release it, it should pop back into place immediately.  (You can try this on the back of your own hand as an example) As the tissue under the skin loses moisture, the skin moves back more slowly.  In extreme cases, the skin doesn't pop back.            - The eyes appear sunken and lack moisture.             - The mouth appears dry. ... gums and nose are dry.              - Darker, less frequent urination           - Delayed capillary refill time:        Pull up your dog's lip and look at her gums. Place your index finger firmly against the gums so that they appear white.  Remove your finger and see how quickly the blood returns to the gums (they will become pink in that area again). This is called Capillary Refill Time. If you do this when everything is normal, you will have a basis upon which to compare. The gums of a normal dog refill immediately,  the gums of a dehydrated dog could take 3 seconds or so to return to their pink state.         - Greyish skin      But with loose motions for that long, I'd get her to a sympathetic vet right now. Good luck to your little dog.|`|9ee31f6ad55abff4de3f8f5aaae5508daa	Take her to another Vet and get a second opinion and try to get some blood work done on her.

bh679FD0aa	Ok, this is alot to answer :   -- you should get whatever food the breeder/store/person was feeding, until the vet recomends otherwise.   --set up a dog crate with soft bedding located near you so you can let puppy out to go potty.Crate should only be large enough for pup to stretch out/lay down /stand, get bigger ones as it grows.Keep area draft-free Your vet should give you tips on crate training/also BOOKS are highly recomended!   -- Call your local vet, set up appt.Let them know you are a first time pup owner. Bring fresh stool sample and any paper work you got on puppy.Bring the name of the food as well. Puppy will get a full exam stem to stern. Then depending on breed/age/lifestyle of pup your vet may get you on the following schedule:    8 weeks old --  1 distemper/Parvo. vaccine,Deworming medication, Frontline topical(flea.tick prevention) check stool sample,   12 weeks --  2 distemper/parvo. vaccine,deworming,check stool,Rabies vaccine,Frontline monthly,Heartworm prevention,   16 weeks --  3 distemper/parvo. adult vaccine,deworming,Frontline(monthly),Hea... prevention(monthly), Your vet will discuss other vaccines such as "kennel cough",Lyme and Leptospirosis. Also now is the time to plan for puppys spay/neuter.    After these series of vaccines most are boostered yearly with your pets exam.      -- Find local training class' for your puppy.Your vet can help you there too. All dogs need training,large or small. Plus it bonds dog to owner and builds respect.   -- Is your home puppy-proof? Clean floors, no objects to chew like tiny toys,wires,pins etc... All toxins unreachable.   -- Locate a groomer   -- do you have an emergency 24 hr vet   available?    -- Have you looked at pros/cons of pet insurance to help pay for a lifetime of bills?   -- locate boarding kennels   -- READ/LEARN/LISTEN TO YOUR VET   I hope this helps!

Usually it take several monthes to master the outdoor potty.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	If you do a web search you can probably find more details on how to care for a puppy.  A lot depends on how old the puppy is.  If it is very young still, give it appropriate food (puppy food, its teeth are still baby teeth).  You can start housebreaking it by taking it on many walks and praising it when it does its business outside.  Puppies do need to be vaccinated (I think there are 2 sets you need to get them at different ages).  Since it's a new puppy, I'd take it to the vet just for an initial checkup to make sure everything is good.  Vet can check for fleas too (and will tell you how to handle fleas depending on how old the puppy is).  Give it a bed (or crate train it) so it knows where to go to sleep (and try not to disturb it when he's in bed).  Don't keep it outside until it gets older.  Get it toys so it knows what it can chew on and what it can't.  Remember that what you think is cute behavior now might not be acceptable when it grows up so don't allow it to get into any potential bad habits now (if you aren't going to allow the grown dog on the furniture, don't allow the puppy on the furniture now).  Basically, you are starting to teach it that you are the alpha dog of the pack and he has to obey you.  Keep in mind it is a puppy so be lenient but do start teaching him the rules now.|`|7d60c2e4179cf0fe8df7c2b55c02fd32aa	your breeder can guide you...  keep it inside with you, no flea collar,,, make your vet appt. immediately...|`|8ff3d37d29a038b18ae4847a0c5475cbaa	first, take her to the vet for any necessary vaccinations and health check. get lots of little toys to chew on, cuz puppies chew alot. a good idea is to get her a crate and crate train her, you can get a book on that. puppy pads help with potty training, took me a couple of weeks to get my dog fully potty trained. good luck!|`|zcq7OWREaa	Be extremely careful buying it flea collars. Alot of dogs have serious reactions to them.   Don't try to potty train them until they're atleast 5 months because they're too young and nieve still.    Most dogs adore it outside so take him/her outside sometimes and he'll eventually start going outside.   dogs love bones to chew on, which will also help save your shoes and other items. potty training normally takes about 5 months or so. go to a vet or petstore and get heartworm pills and flea drops. Go to like a dollar general and buy a bottle of Flinstones vitamins and give him either .5 or a whole one a day and he'll keep pretty fur. they LOVE treats but only give them to him when he's done something you're proud of! btw, the vet should know the vaccinations he needs and when he needs them. dogs vary on vaccination dates and kinds.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	Well what kind of pup did you get???

Make sure you give him or her fresh water in a bowel everyday. It's important to keep him inside with you for at least the first week, so he or she can settle & bond with you. Get a soft warm bed for it & then a dog kennel/house, (what type of bread is this dog?). Brush it lightly once a week & when you get it worming treatment plus flea collars, make sure it's for puppies & read instructions. When it gets a little older, take it for a walk each day on a leash. Make an appointment with your local Vet for a check up & ask the vet any other questions concerning your dog. Also give it lot & lots of love & affection. ok! hope that helps, good luck to you & your new friend!

9ce729067b548b41028ada4c614c9c04aa	They will do blood testing I'm sure, and they will want to do a fecal test too.  All of this is very expensive!  When my German Shepard had stomach problems, they did blood testing and fecal testing, as well as an x-ray.  All of that costs us $380.00 approx.  Most of vets are very understanding financially, and they are just glad that you are trying to take care of your dog, so ask them if you can pay half now and the other half in a week or two.

Well, thats actually a symptom, not a disease. You may want to consider euthanizing the poor thing, they almost NEVER come back from dropsy. Luckily it isn't very contageous, but you'll want to do a big water change in the tank she was in and start treatment with Maracyn-Two. Also raise the temperature to 85F. Also, definately keep her away from the other fish. If you DO want to treat her, put her in a tank you can heat, but don't have anything else in there. Clean the water regularly and raise the temp to 85F, put in an airstone, and treat with Maracyn-Two and Tetrecycline. Mail me with any questions.|`|YU51MbZDaa	drop some ick in ur town|`|AA11409431	Most fish stores have additives for the water that will help with their slime coat and with any infections they may have.  Nothing will help them look immediately better, but you can try the additives.|`|ypqgIA3zaa	Go to a pet store and ask someone who knows more about it. They should know. Probably tell you to give them some kind of solution or something.|`|SLJuildsaa	First and foremost, isolate the guppy if you can. Even a small plastic tank will do as a temporary hospital tank. The tank should be treated with a small amount of AQUARIUM salt, not salt like someone would eat. (I don't know how much you know about fish in general, so I don't mean to make you out to be stupid, so I apologize if anything comes out that way). Also, you should go to the pet store and ask about fin repair medications. Make sure you make it clear that you're not looking for a fin rot cure, but instead something to help regrow fins damaged in a fight.    As far as the scales sticking, up, be very careful with that. Make sure that it's just fight damage. If your fish's body is noticeably bloated, it means that he most likely has dropsy. It's not incurable, but the medication is very expensive and its' a strenuous treatment, so unless you've got money to burn and you're totally in love with the fish, I wouldn't bother with the medication.  Don't do a mercy killing or anything. Just isolate the fish because it might only be fight damage, not dropsy. See if it gets better. If he gets bloated, DO NOT put him back in the tank, otherwise he could infect your other fish.|`|hWiFqpiAaa	Since you have the fish isolated, there is no risk of further injury. Cool.    What you need to be concerned with now is keeping the damaged tissues from becoming infected. A simple solution to that is to treat the water with something that has an anti-bacterial quality - in the case of a Guppy, I would suggest Melafix. Keep the water clean with water changes and feed the fish well, it will be fine.    The damaged fins will grow back, but it will take time.    What kind of advice is "ask a pet store?" Maybe the asker was asking here hoping for an intelligent answer.....

He sounds extremely unhappy.  Have you thought about switching his food to something with a low protein count?  He's getting up there in age now, and too much protein can overheat the blood.  He doesn't need it.  There are plenty of 'old boys' feeds around these days.  And hounds basically do better on something simple.  Obviously you need to switch him gradually or you will upset his tummy which he doesn't need too!    Are you in the UK?  If so, it's a strange time of year for him to have this sort of allergy.  There is a steroid shot that is 'long lasting' and this can calm down this sort of reaction but generally this is needed in the summer, not when it's cold.  Has he been castrated?  This could also be hormonal.    I do think you need to discuss this in much more depth with your vet, and if you don't get the help you need, switch vets, or take a second opinion.  It doesn't sound as if your dog is enjoying life very much and at the least, he should have a full blood workup done to get to the bottom of what's going on with him.|`|DsgGSkRcaa	he has to much energy he needs to use it all up and if that sont work ask the vet about it

NllWkSDiaa	Foot problems is canaries may be caused by a diet that is too rich in protein or fat. The foot may be sligthly red and warm, and the bird favours one foot. Feed extra greens like dandelion, romaine, or raw broccoli, stop feeding eggs. A more serious foot problem is abscessed foot pad., or known as bumble foot. If left untreated this could lead to toe loss or can permanently cripple the bird. It is best to treat the foot with Betadine, but consult an avian vet first. To prevent disease to birds feet, always provide a well  balanced diet. Next they must have clean cages and perches. Use round oval, or natural perches free from splinters.  Never use sandpaper perches or cage bottom liners. Keep nail trimmed. Avoid overcrowding.  Avoid nylon fibers or human hair which can wrap around toes, eventually the foot will turn black and fall off.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Get your canary to the vet ASAP.  If she isn't using one leg, that could mean that leg is broken.  She needs medical attention.  Also, the swelling in the other leg could be due to an injury or to mites.

enC9TvxUaa	-It is absurd the dog survived in this case, only to be left in a plastic garbage bag.  They NEED to put them down in a truly humane way if that has to be done!|`|JiCKFTuIaa	They are an absolute necessity, or would you like to be the one giving that rabid feral cat or raccoon it's shot.     Somehow I thought not.    Some shelters only have a gas chamber because you won't donate enough money for them to be able to afford a second method for animals that are not rabid.    Accidents do happen as unfortunate as they are. How many times has capital punishment been botched in our history.|`|MvOxmKqTaa	I believe it is an unnecessary and cruel method of dealing with pet over-population. Hopefully this method will be eliminated soon.|`|HmkCFddAaa	A lot of shelters have done away with the gas chambers and use things like sodium penathol. No shelter can keep all the animals that they have or there would be no room for more to come in. The care and euthanasia of these animals has to be paid for by someone. I grew up at a animal shelter as my dad was the humane officer and dog warden, and even though you don't want to put any of the animals down it has to be done. There are far more unwanted dogs in this world then there are homes sadly.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	The bill they are trying to pass is good in theory but unfortunately is just asking for problems in practice.  At least in NC where this incident happened most of the shelters that still use the "gas chamber" are shelters in rural areas that don't have sufficient funding to afford other methods of euthanasia.  The gas chamber is considered a step up from the method used in even poorer areas which is to shoot the animals.   Is this bill going to come with funding for those shelters to be able to afford a more humane method of euthanasia?   It doesn't appear that it is going to.   So that is where the problem occurs.  You take away the method they can afford to use but don't really give them a good alternative because they can't afford to euthanize in any other way.  While I agree the "gas chamber" is not the best method by any means doing away with it with out funding to back up more humane methods is simply not the solution.    As far as what happened to this dog it does happen.  If a large number of animals were put in at once the ones in the middle are believed to be shielded to some extent causing it to take longer for them to die.  Larger dogs also take longer than smaller dogs using this method.    This is more a matter of proper training (checking to ensure each animal is indeed dead before disposing of it)    rather than the method used though. An animal "reviving" from euthanasia can occur with any method including injection if not properly done.  (animal not left long enough in gas chamber, not enough medication given etc)   that is why it is important to ensure death in each animal regardless of the method used.|`|Bw18seFqaa	I would prefer that the shelter use euthanasia.. but most shelters that gas are those located in rural areas where the shelter does not have much funding.      The shelter relies on donations, adoption fees and tax payer's money to keep themselves up and running..  they have limited resources to "pay for it themselves"..  most shelter workers are un-paid volunteers, so they can NOT cut back wages that they dont pay!      In all reality.. you cant blame the shelter for killing dogs, or for the method they use..  blame the people who continue to breed, blame the people who dump their dogs, blame the people who insist on buying from irresponsible breeders..  dont blame the shelter.. they are doing the best they can to clean up every one else's mess!|`|c3449795a2170e15d0045bdb2ede4799aa	I'm against the killing of any healthy animal.  i think if a shelter's going to have something like that they need to either pay for it themselves or take so much out of their employees pay.|`|cLlqnASTaa	Actually many cost studies show that gas chambers cost more, and that euthanasia by injection can SAVE money for these counties.  Besides state law requires that gas chambers not be used for certain categories of animals anyway, so the shelters have to be set up and trained for injection already.  Changing to injection can save money and make it safer for employees at the same time.  Let's get out of the dark ages.
TpOVmqpHaa	I couldn't agree with you more.  In fact, I recently heard that the Bulldog standards are getting a good look-over for the precise purpose of reducing their health problems.  It's about damn time!  Selective breeding for cosmetic purposes has rendered some breeds little more than unhealthy mutants.  Whether it's the actual standard in place, or breeders who 'interpret' a standard to extremes, this is a huge problem that must be reined in.  My thinking is that any breed of dog should be able to survive on it's own, if God forbid, it ever had to.   Many breeds would simply die out if tested, either because they couldn't tolerate outdoor climate, hunt, or even reproduce naturally.  Survival of the fittest.  Shouldn't we be breeding the 'fittest'???    ADD:  Alias got it all wrong.  I never said dogs should be bred for survival in the wild.  I said that they should be healthy and well equipped enough that they could if the need arose.  The argument that we 'don't breed for that' is silly.  Of course we don't, but there ARE plenty of feral dogs that have done just that -SURVIVED- on their own.  I said they should be able to breed naturally .....not selectively.  LOL  Would I rather own a breed that stood a chance of living through something like hurricaine Katrina......or a breed like the one championed a few years back who required surgery to breathe, and had to be kept on ice indoors???  ""For example, a Pekingese, bred to possess a perfectly flat face, and winner of Best in Show in 2003, was found to have surgery to enable it to breathe.""  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2...    Decisions, decisions.  Anyone who's voiced their concerns about the health of purebreds is quickly hushed and retaliated against by the masses who like their mutants just fine, thank you.|`|66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	Most breed standards are quite old, and fanciers of every breed have been living with their standard for many years. I would think that longtime fanciers of the breed, and not the casual observers should have the most input on amendments to the breed standard. Most people on YA Dogs are casual observers.  Having said that, it seems logical to me that folks who are active in a breed for many years would have lobbied for positive changes to their breed standard. Anyone who truly fancies a breed would want the best for that breed, and they would try to persuade their parent club and the  AKC to amend the standard only if necessary. Changes have been made over the years, but for the most part, the real fanciers of all breeds feel that their breed standard is fine the way it is.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Not really, the interpretation is subject to "fad", and that will still happen even if the wording in a standard is changed.    Here is an example;  Mandigo was one of the breeds leading sires of all time.  http://www.mandigoretrievers.com/mandigo...  However,, the standard for the breed at that time said that the ears would be "set low and well back"  Thus the common statement that "your dog has mandigo ears"  For almost 10 years, if your lab didn't have high set ears it simply didn't win very often.  Example of how mandigo ears make a head look wider.  http://www.mandigoretrievers.com/DeuceBl...|`|f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	I would say if someone wants to suggest a standard change - it should be the reputable and responsible breeders of parent clubs that should do it.  As a person who shows dogs  - I don't see 1/10th as many breathing problems with reputably produced dogs as I do with the BYB dogs from down the street.  So fixing the standard for people who only care about boy parts and girl parts will do nothing for the breed.    Informed consumers, who are willing to wait for a quality well bred dog, from a reputable breeder will be all that will change anything.    As long as there are puppy mills and BYB and pet stores and people selling dogs in the Walmart parking lot - that breeds will not change.    Who would police this change?  Who decides? Another example of a well intentioned thought that has unintended consequences.|`|jvIVWgVnaa	I personally think that the breed should not be changed, but that purchasers and owners of these animals should be better educated before buying a puppy of a certain breed.  I have both pugs and pekingese.  All of which have extremely flat faces.  However I have never had any breathing problems with them.  But I know it does happen.  People just need to be prepared to accomodate and try to correct a problem if one should arise.  But a flat face is what they were bred for.  That's why it's a breed standard.      The second thing is that people who do have "show quality" animals (flat faces, breed standard) generally know the background and the health of the animals in it.  To modify the breed standard, you would basically have to start crossing with the dogs of a back yard breeder or dogs that are unfit for showing for other reasons..which could add more complications instead of fixing the ones that they already have.|`|uTIgyCCHaa	I see your point, but IMO that would completely defeat the purpose of "preserving the breed."  Breeds must be "preserved" because they are man-made; that's not how they would originally be if we were to allow "survival of the fittest" to determine how the breed evolved.  The breed would lose all those features that it was originally bred for, and we'd just get back to the common dog.    You don't see packs of wild pomeranians, great danes or shar pei's running around; they just wouldn't survive in the wilderness, and that is just fine because odds are that's NOT what they were bred for, so why should they be expected to have to live like that?  If we were breeding them for their ability to survive in the wild, we would have left them as they were:  wolves.      Add:  I just think that they were bred that way for a reason.  I think that health testing should be required for breeding dogs instead of changing those physical features that make a breed.    You've named the boxer a "very brachycephalic breed."  I wouldn't consider it VERY brachycephalic, especially not compared to a pug, boston terrier, or shih tzu, but I suppose that depends on where you are in the world.  Over the years, the head shape of the boxer, particularly the length of the nose, has strayed from the original breed standard.  In America it has become slightly longer (less brachycephalic); in Europe, it has become much noticeably shorter (more brachychephalic).  You'd think that this would lead to more health issues in European boxers, but actually it is the opposite:  European boxers are generally healthier than boxers in America.  That is because Europe has much stricter breeding programs, requiring health screenings and even physical fitness tests.  In America, I've seen plenty of boxers with noses much too long for the breed standard.  These dogs are NOT necessarily healthier.    You're right -- it is NOT always the case that breeders breed healthy animals.  Whether they are compromising the dog's health by disregarding the standard completely or even by overdoing the standard so to speak.  I think that is more an issue of BYBs vs. responsible breeders, NOT an issue necessarily with the breed standard.      And Becky, I did understand what you meant.  I do believe that dogs should be HEALTHY.  I don't think that it is necessary for every dog to be physically capable of surviving a few nights in the wilderness.  Those two things are completely different.  My boxers are healthy and physically fit, but they STILL have short coats that cannot keep them warm at night if the temperatures were to drop.  I don't choose my pets based on whether they would be able to survive a natural disaster.    Yes, I know you said they should be able to breed naturally, not selectively.  But breeding dogs IS selective.  So how would you propose that we let them breed naturally?  Throw a bunch of boxers together and let them mate as they please?  Toss a bunch of dogs of various breeds together in the same way?    And of course I don't think that it's acceptable in the slightest to physically alter a dog with such a serious health condition, and then let that dog go on to win shows and breed.  OF COURSE I think it's important for dogs to be healthy.  I don't however think that requires changing the breed standard.  It requires more honest and dedicated breeders.|`|5O7op0oIaa	Anything that is detrimental to the dog should be removed from a standard. Half of them are so warped that they could not, under any circumstance, actually perform the task they were originally bred for.      That said, I own mutts, so what would I know?    EDIT:  Person below writes,    "But a flat face is what they were bred for. That's why it's a breed standard."    Can I invite you to run a search for 'circular argument'?     It's bascially what you're left with when you don't have any form of valid logic, and have to use the point you're arguing about to justify itself.    Not good.      EDIT II:    Oh, and MCC -     "I would say if someone wants to suggest a standard change - it should be the reputable and responsible breeders of parent clubs that should do it."    I would agree, but for the fact that you have consistently and conspicuously failed in your duty to do so. Now, the responsibility needs to be removed from your hands, and placed with those who care more about animal welfare than producing ugly, unhealthy factory-line mutants.|`|cETQuE9waa	In my own breed, Pomeranians I would like to see a longer snout/muzzle.  A longer snout/muzzle means bigger teeth, better roots on the teeth, better bites(scissor in Pomeranians), and also less breathing problems.     I like a foxier looking Pomeranian because just that muzzle/snout that is a little long allows for bigger teeth and healthier roots on the teeth.     I do agree with you about a longer snout/muzzle.    Pugs, Pekes, Shih Tzu's are also effected by short muzzles.
L22hVXTIaa	I have 4 Chis and I just fell in love with their miniature size and their faces!!!  I just can't resist them.  They are wonderful dogs.  Very smart, but they can be stubborn.

However, with that said, many years ago, I used to breed and show German Shepherds - beautiful dogs!|`|I12oUQZPaa	Black Labrador Retriever.     Daughter not allergic to the breed. Research matched lifestyle/what we were looking for in a pet.    Recommend only after you have fully researched the breed to understand what is coming home with you. Spend time with the breed, puppies and adults to be sure this is what you really want. Seek a breed rescue, or shelter that will give you the pet's history (especially helpful if you have other pets/children).  Or, find reputable breeder, not a pet store or back yard breeder. Does your pet have to be a puppy, is older an option? Obedience Training is a must. Attention & Exercise is a must.|`|4uSRVZNNaa	jack russell terrier  we wanted a smaller dog and we knew someone who breeds them.  if you are an active person and have the time for a high maintenance dog then yes.  if you are a couch potato then don't do a jack the disservice.  they have a lot of energy and love exercise.|`|KlkUj6uFaa	Pug!

A tough name for a big softy!     They are great companions and love to be with families. They do however have their chosen one that they love the best. I would say "couch potato" is their middle name and if you're a light sleeper then forget it - bullys love to snore... very loudly! Also not great walkers, my boy has to be encouraged to go out and play, he looks at me with his chubby little face as if to say "you go on ahead, I'll catch you up!" So so funny, my bully makes me laugh everyday, I couldn't be without him     My boy is a sweetheart and I love him with a passion. I would definitely recommend a bully for a pet.    And...at last the British Kennel Club has recognised the need for breeding restrictions, which will improve on the bullys health in the future.|`|70yqZp3caa	I have a Sable Cocker Spaniel.Its kinda a story how i got that breed. We have a pet store in our town and me and my mom would visit it every weekend and each time i would fall in love with a cocker spaniel. I think about 2 months ago they had a beatiful Red Roan Cocker spaniel. It was black and white with beatiful soft hair and big round puppy dog eyes. I begged and begged my mom  for it and cried when it was sold. I said i would never go back. A month later i finnaly decided to go back. My mom stopped me outside the door and said. "There is a beatiful cocker spaniel in there. It is white with black and brown spots. She is beatiful and so soft. You cant have her though" I went in and absouletly loved her. When it was time to go i wouldnt let go. (this was all 3 weeks b4 christmas). Well my mom (2 weeks b4 christmas) was talking to my dad about something and 1 week before christmas drove me there. I ran inside and grabbed the dog. "Sarah that is your dog lets go buy it" I Practilly cried! I mostly got that breed because they are a medium sized dog, excellent to sleep with, beatiful, and fun!     Of course i would reccomend it! They are so beatiful and entertaining to watch. They do require responsibilty but i believe that is preparing you for your life when your a mother. In fact right now she is sleeping on my lap :)                http://s289.photobucket.com/albums/ll222...       +.+|`|a6an2aN0aa	I have two mutts.

It wasn't really my choice to get this breed, but it was because my dad bred our dogs and got Maggy, and I finally decided to keep her. She's really fun and loyal. She loves to curl up and play with her special blue tennis ball. She chews up bones and usually stays away from chewing on shoes. She does have issues with finding a toilet, though. When I let her outside I do have to watch her constantly, she's so tiny and a bird of prey might easily eat her.    Of course I would recommend dachshunds as pets for anyone who just wants a tiny lovable companion.|`|Op6z8nogaa	LURCHER :)  Got him from a rescue home not so long ago.   Hes lovely.

So get a medium/large dog with a mother-like personality.

He was on death row in Austin Tx when he was rescued.  Bridget came from the SPCA in Fredericksburg Tx where she had been turned in by a farmer who caught her in his chicken coop.      Jack Russell's are very intelligent, athletic and energetic.  Admittedly they are not the dogs for everyone, but I love my little terrorists.  You must be willing to share your life with them.  They want to be inside with you all the time but need lots of exercise too.  They are rough on other small pets as they are bred for hunting.    My two are both very loving and appreciative of their new home.  Whatever breed you decide on, look on the internet for Pet-finders and you can find anything there.  Adopt a dog and save a life.  Its the only true love that money can buy.|`|s9haCi64aa	Yellow Labrador    I got this breed as I wanted a dog that I could take on long walks and one that loved swimming.

That's the best reason of all!|`|oVwGit7qaa	Labradoodles and goldendoodles are cute. Some are small some are  big. Depending on the parents.

But if you really want one its up to you, different dogs fit different peoples personalities. Such as here are a few examples, and good dogs!   1. Golden retriever: a nice loving, very loyal dog, beautiful, very long hair, usually enjoy swimming   2. Labrador: nice, loving, and loyal also, usually short haired, and enjoys swimming, and fetching   3. Border Collie: originally used for herding sheep, long hair, very loyal,and loving, and extremely smart  4. German Shepard: police dogs, big, and loyal, medium hair length, loving   Don't go for breeders thought you can find dogs that are both mixes, and need a home! Look at your local SPCA or pound. I have a border collie, flat coat retriever (black retriever), and maybe some lab in him. All dogs are usually sweet, so look at some animal shelters! Good luck! Hope you find your dog soon!|`|ZXz9aavcaa	i think a rottweiler there beautifull|`|I4vPxh3jaa	1. if you are not able to take full responsibility for they dog and take care of it. then DO NOT get one. getting a dog is a long time commitment.   2. if you feel ready to get a dog.... i would say german Shepherd. they are smart. kind, obedient and energetic. very good dogs.  3. perhaps you can go to your local shelter and give a dog a home|`|FSKEk1A1aa	If this is your first dog and you're not very responsible, then you should probably get a smaller dog instead of a bigger dog. Reasons that most people want bigger dogs is because they're friendlier and loyal, while smaller dogs are more independent. I would suggest that you go with a smaller dog with short legs and one that doesn't really exercise very much like a dachshund or a basset hound. If you just want to jump ahead for a big dog, make sure you read all about them first and make sure you can supply what they need, including beds, walks, food, a place for a bathroom, etc. If you want a large dog that's reliable and easy to train you should get a Golden Retriever or Black Labrador. Please make sure you read about them and don't get one if you're going to end up putting him/her in a pound. Also, if you want a really healthy dog consider neutering/spaying him/her.|`|F4rD4HF0aa	i have a lab and there really nice dog but they need to be let out alot cause they like to play alot|`|7vJNHaskaa	I think going to the shelter is your best bet. You can see each dog and interact with them. They do testing to make sure it is safe with other dogs, people, and cats. They know the temperament of the dogs and you will be able to pick out the dog that's right for you.    Also, if you don't want to train them, you can get an older dog (1-2 years old) and they will be housebroken already. Good luck!    (and if you bring your mom along, she might fall for the dog that you choose, you might have a better chance of a yes) but make sure you take care of it..|`|Q87djE0laa	st bernard, great dane or bull masstiff|`|6ca36162e3c109e0cc5c9ca79ca4b4bcaa	An Akita--- great Pets & could Double as a Guard Dog|`|0TghwMJqaa	If you're serious about getting a dog and you're active, patient, have money for obedience and have the energy to look after a dog i would get a Siberian Husky.

Long haired dogs shed ALOT. I have a german shepherd after having big shorthaired dogs and it is a drastic change.  Large short haired breeds include dalamations, very good family dog; doberman, check with your insurance carrier; pit bulls, can be great dogs if raised right, but again check with insurance carrier and get advice on good training.

BMH - I want you to look at the yorkie standard and show me where you see the words Toy or TEACUP in the size portion.    http://ytca.org/standard.html    http://ytca.org/faq.html A Again there is no such thing as a goddamn teacup yorkie|`|xQtnTKCAaa	dont get a teacup. i always wanted a teacup yorkie or Chihuahua but apparently they can get hurt really easily because of their size.|`|QjoWA99Yaa	The term "teacup" is just a term to describe the pup who is the runt of the litter. Makes them sound cuter but it's the same breed of dog as any other.

There are dozens on the market such as Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Canidae, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul, Diamond, Innova.  Try one of these and see if it helps the problem.|`|I12oUQZPaa	Take a stool sample to your vet.    Reaction to chicken/turkey in the diet? Huge YES to above comments on dog food & dog treats: Read the ingredients & know what you are feeding your pet as you would read the ingredients on packages for yourself at the store.      Stick to one brand/one flavor.  When introducing a new food to your dog: Mix a little of the new with the old.  Gradually increase the amount of new until the old is gone.      In the source is good fyi on Naturally Healthy Dog Treats.  At that site you can also read more about Premium Dog Food.  More than a cheap plug - the researched information is helpful.  I have a relative with an adult dog who gets gassy from peanut butter - treats included.  Ours is ok with peanut butter.  Another relative's dog got loose stools from flavored raw hides treats.     We started our pup on Artemis.  Chicken/Turkey caused gas, can happen in some pups. I was bummed, liked the quality. Switched to Solid Gold Wolf Cub.  Now on Wolf King.     Lift adult dog food, or serve at different locations maybe?|`|iVQULHqYaa	My dog hardly ever passes nasty smelly wind. I now know from my researches, that grain in dog food creates digestive problems. My dog had other problems because of grain. Investigate "grain free" puppy food on the Internet.    Everyone talks about peoples food being bad for dogs. Food is food, although I would introduce so called "people's food" to a puppy gradually, I make extra food when I cook my meal and I give this to my dog. She does not get extra's included in her meal because this could make her picky. She gets a seperate meal of the things that I cook. However if a dog is limited to dog  food and nothing else, this creates problems if they scavange. Obviously she does not get highly spiced things like curry, however she has a small typical Sunday dinner including Yorkshire puddings. I also give her pasta and various other things. I do this because I think that a very strict diet can cause problems if she finds something when we are out. Obviously if I see her scavaging I will stop her eating rubbish but accidents do happen. I do realise that there is grain in Yorkshire puddings and pasta, thankfully she is fine if her basic diet is grain free.|`|q5DTcOuaaa	Dogs are like horses, they fart a lot. There isn't anything you can about it. If you really want to stop them just take them to the vet and they will do something about digestive gases.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-You may be able to help some.  A GOOD quality diet is key!  Less fillers!  NO, and I mean NO, people food!!!|`|r9BXyz9zaa	well i don't know why it does this, but ask your vet, your dog may just have diaria and that's just a symtom. (or your vet could be as puzzeld as I am...=1)|`|QjoWA99Yaa	Farting is normal and yes, dog farts smell! Make sure he's not getting raw meat and maybe swap his food to food that especially for dogs with funny tummies!|`|3a111643f378dea0bf7d2a6824721d86aa	Just take the smell.

Some foods make dogs fart a lot.  It also could mean he has to poop but it is probably his food. Talk to your vet and they may have a new food suggestion|`|Ot06v8yvaa	cant do anything    unless it is the food you give him.    it can be the moist food or the dry food that causes the farts|`|rdEm25fEaa	Do you feed him people food? People food is horrible for dogs...and it makes them really gassy. Otherwise, you pretty much just have to grin and bear it.
