For bank have many problems too, and more than ours.      I think this is chance to reduce debt or debt cures. Because when some bank failures, some investment institutes or Asset Management company will buy asset(include debts) from bank      What price they buy?      I don't know but basicly   -  they cannot buy more than collateral  value..(Coll 100 debt ost. 120 they buy only 70 or lower)   - they have cost of fund to buy asset therefore they have to quickly collect cash back..      Follow exp. This is chance to pay only 80 for out of debt or not.

Recently I accepted a job in a restaurant. In the interview I told the manager I had no previous experience, though I have had 2 jobs in the past. I lied because the first job was in a restaurant, I did not get along with the manager or other staff.I thought it would sound bad to say I quit a job similar to the one I now want. The second I was fired from because of a mix -up with booking time off. I had only worked at the shop for about 6 weeks.    In the interview the manager asked if I had done any paid work in the past, I said no.   I thought I had got away with my lie until I had to declare on a form whether I had worked in the last 6 months, I assume for tax purposes. The form was from the company's central office,not the branch employing me.  I said yes I had worked, thinking if it got to the Inland Revenue I had lied about employment it may blight my record for a long time.    What I need to know is: Will the manager at my branch of the restaurant ever see this form,or will it go to the head-office/central accounts department? Will he be able to cross-reference the info I gave and see the discrepency?   Second, if the manger discovers I lied about experience is it likely I will be fired. I assume lying about not having exp. is better than saying you have had jobs that you have not.   I am 17, living in the UK   Help from employers or those that have been in the same position is greatly appreciated. Thanks.

I am going into outside sales which means driving around all over the place to meet clients. And I am very good at fixing cars; I have a garage full of the right tools. But, I don't have much time anymore (maybe like 5 hours every Sunday).       I have two 12-year old cars (sedan and SUV) both over 150,000 miles. They both need paint and minor body work; one needs a/c, water pump, and rubber suspension parts. They both should get a full tune-up.      I just abhor car payments! Now, I can truly afford a payment of less than $300/mo. as long as nothing catastrophic happens to my family ( I do have insurance all around).      Should I take my limited time and fix up both cars (alternating one as the other's up on jacks during the week)? Or should I get a nicer, newer used car that doesn't need any kind of "restoring?" Do people see a sales person driving up in a "beater" and think,"Geez, that business can't be too successful. Look at what that chap is driving?" What should I do?

I have been reading a lot of crap from McCain supporters saying they own a thriving business but will scale back so it makes less than 250K. They also say they will lay off Obama supporters. Lol I am sure those people hated working for you, and guess what you will get to pay their unemployment insurance. So you are gonna be a big baby and take your ball and leave because you didn't get it your way? Basically you are saying you want to insure the economy fails. Guess what there are a lot of intelligent folks out there that just happened to grow up poor. That would love to make over $250K a year, and wouldn't mind paying extra taxes because we would still be better off. Basically go ahead kill your business and create a vacuum people like me will be quick to get some loans and money together to grow a business to topple you anyhow. See some people want America to succeed, and we realize the better you treat your workers the happier they are, and the more money they put back into the economy. Your workers put way more money back into the system than the rich cry babies do.

I had one four years ago and they are good for 10 years and they still tried to give and charge me for one while i was getting the stitches.

20081110161013AAGDeK2	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Why did my cash deposit credit immediately with an ATM?	I use Bank of America and checked my online banking account about 10 minutes after depositing money at the ATM. It appears as a pending transaction but my AVAILABLE balance has been readjusted with the new deposit.       I used a newer ATM machine that doesn't require an envelope for deposits and reads the money upon insertion. It then asks to verify the quantity and amount of bills placed inside. I'm assuming this probably does the job of verifying the bills instead of having a bank teller do that for the ATM.

20090222125333AAMpXBt	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	What should I make hourly if it is my fifth year working for this company, help (details included)?	I've been working for an ice cream shop since I was fourteen, I am valuable to the company. This is going on five years. I started at minimum wage when it was $5.15. Then earned a raise to $5.75 after 4 months. Then I earned another raise the following year to $6.15. When we went back in the spring (I think this is year 3) min. wage had increased to $6.85 so then I was training new coworkers who earned the same amount as me, I was furious. I asked for a raise and was given $7.35. The following year I received another raise to $7.75. This is what I currently make. I just found out min. wage in my state is now $7.30. I earned several raises myself through hard work and I do not believe my pay is fairly adjusted.

Los fines de semana trabajo y libro solo un dia y medio a la semana. Las fiestas nacionales no me las respetan. Eso ya lo hable antes de entrar y acepte las condiciones. El problema es el siguiente. Mi cordinadora, parece ser que no le caigo muy bien. Y mi compa?era digamos que no es muy buena persona. Cada vez que cometo el más minimo error mi cordinadora aprobecha para sacarle punta al error. Cuando comete un error mi compa?era, mi cordinadora le dice: no te preocupes, no pasa nada. El caso es que me esta empezando a sacar de quicio y ya no lo aguanto más. Mi cordinadora siempre que tiene que hacer un trabajo suyo, le pide ayuda a mi compa?era, y a mi ni me menciona. Una vez me ofrecí a ayudarla y me contesto que no se fiaba de mi, y que no quería que la ayudara. No es que no se fie de mi, es que intenta por todos los medios hacerme ver que no me quiere allí, que le caigo mal. Por eso cuando cometo el más minimo error, intenta hacer ver que es muy grave, cuando no lo es. A mi cuando me contrataron me dijeron que hiciera todo lo posible para quedarme el tiempo de la campa?a, y así no dejarles tirados. He renunciado a dos empleos por cumplir con mi palabra de no dejarles tirados. Pero me está empezando a hartar y temo perder los papeles algun día.      ?Qué hariais en mi lugar?

20090222195216AABtpYg	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Why don't I like my job/career?	I'm really confused with my career right now, and I want to be sure of it before its too late...      I graduated from college with a BS degree in computer science 3 years ago and since, I have had 2 jobs. First job lasted 1 year, i liked it to a point, but it was stressful. I wasn't bad at it because I was still learning, but I wasn't the best programmer.  It wasn't that i hated it, it was just stressful - so I thought i hated it.  I left and got a technical support job with another (bigger) company. I simply hate this job. The difference between this and the previous job is not just hate working at it, but I am not good with it.  I constantly make mistakes, therefore, I'm working much more than i should because i have to fix them.  I cannot think about solutions to issues this job requests (either out of inexperience or inability). I've even stopped pushing myself at taking on new projects. I just do what i am assigned to do and that's it.      From childhood, I've had a dream of being in air force pilot (its just a childish dream) but im starting to even consider that now - but I keep thinking its still childish.        Is it just me? or is it my job? or is it my career?  Is there councilor I can talk to about this, or something that can guide me in what to look for. Because I know i was something different, but I just don't know what it is...      Thanks in advance!

We live in the country on many acres and I have always been an avid gardener.  My daughter was getting married, and she decided to have it here. She was married in our gazebo and we had a large beautiful tent for the reception.  Because of my gardens and all the other features, (water gardens, etc) the guest said it was the most beautiful wedding they had been too.  In addition, a friend's, son decided to get married and since they could not afford a church etc. we offered our home as well to them.  Again, we had comments how nice it was.   I have had friends and family since than encouraging us to continue a wedding destination here as a business.  My question; has anyone else done this with their home and can offer any advice regarding liabilities, etc and if this would be a business for us to start?      Sorry so long.  Thank you for any help that can be given us.      Sue
