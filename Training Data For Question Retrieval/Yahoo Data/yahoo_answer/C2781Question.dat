20090205092059AADBwoX	Dining Out;Other - Dining Out	How does CiCi's Pizza make any money?	The location here by me, outside of Chicago has a location with a really high lease amount.  They are paying at least $12k/mo for that.  I figured on the low end they have salaries of $12k/mo and food costs have to be at least $5k/mo.  Add to that the costs of operating a business and utilities they need to clear a minimum of $32k/mo probably more.  They charge $5.99/person for the buffet style dining.  A drink is $1.35 more.  Any ideas?  At this rate they would have to serve 5343 people.

20080928042242AAKRSt1	Dining Out;Fast Food	Someone put laxatives in my fast food. What to do?	My husband and I went to Sonic last night at 9 PM before we went to a special cosmic bowling event.  I got the chili dog and fries.  It was all I'd eaten that day.  At the bowling alley, I suddenly got extremely sick with diarrhea, nausea, and severe cramps and pain in my stomach.   I felt so bad that we had to leave the bowling alley at midnight (an hour early) and come home, and I had diarrhea and severe cramps all night long.  And this morning, I'm still having pain.  There is also a slight bitter taste in my mouth.  I'm certain that someone at that restaurant put something in my food. What could it have been and is there any way to prove it?  I'm thinking about calling the manager. Would it do any good or will he think I'm just a nutcase?

Servers get paid more than a hostess however, Fondue server? Fondue looks like a place where couples go for a romantic date, or all women group of friends go, true? If this is right, I can't see myself making that much money there. I don't see a man leaving me a huge tip with his date right across from him. I'm looking for those all businessman crowds, that I can flirt with and they leave ridiculously good tips, can I find that at a Fondue restaurant?      So where would I make the most money? Hostess at upscale restaurant, or server at upscale fondue restaurant?
