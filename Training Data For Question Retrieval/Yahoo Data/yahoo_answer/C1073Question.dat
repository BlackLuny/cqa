Durant ces JOs dans les sports de combat, on a pas eu le droit à de gravissimes erreurs d'arbitrage, mais carrément à des décisions totalement injustifiable.      Là au taekwondo, le cubain se fait soigner et les médecins ont demandé à l'arbitre de suspendre le chronomètre car l'athlète avait un réel problème articulaire. Alors non seulement l'arbitre ne réponde pas, mais il ne procède pas au décompte réglementaire pour la sortie des médecins et annonce la disqualification. Et pire quand l'athlète hurle au complot avec son entra?neur, l'arbitre relève la main et crie la disqualification une deuxième fois alors qu'il n'avait pas à le faire, pour narguer l'athlète et montrer qu'il est le plus fort...

Il est deja aide par la technologie a la fois a l'exterieur de son corps (perche des sauteurs a la perche, maillots des nageurs, bateau des navigateurs) et a l'interieur de son corps (prise de vitamines, de repas equilibres, sejour en altitudes, transfussion sanguines, musculation, medicament, pomades et operations).    Il parrait que le tour de france ne se gagne pas sur la route mes lors des repos: le vainqueur et celui qui recupere le plus vite de son effort de la journee grace a des massages, la prise de produits legaux...    Donc la seule difference entre ce qui est interdit est autorise et de savoir si le produit et sur la liste des produits interdit ou non.    Le seul argument que je vois pour autoriser certains produits et pas d'autres et que certains sont plus dangereux que d'autres.    Mais finalement n'est ce pas au sportif de faire son choix? est il pret a mettre sa vie en danger pour booster sa performance?

New England 31-10 (Shocking score. JT O'Sullivan has a break out game, against a very weak defense.)      Dallas def. Cincinnati 45-17 (Dallas are pissed off after last week's loss. They have to take it out on someone.)      Pittsburgh def. Jacksonville 20-13 (Big Ben leads Pittsburgh down the field to score on the last drive.)      Minnesota def. New Orleans 27-20 (Gus Frerotte throws for a huge game. Drew Brees has his same type of game. 300 + yards by both QB's. Adrian Peterson or Reggie Bush will determine the winner, but I think Adrian Peterson will.)         Byes: Cleveland, Oakland, St. Louis, NY Jets      Make your picks here, and tell why.

20081107104724AA6jIoF	Sports;Baseball	So, where did all these Phillies and Rays fans come from?	Seriously, as a huge sports fan, is there anything worse than a bandwagon fan.  I am okay if you are a little kid and you become a fan of the Championship team, but when you are an adult, and all of a sudden a huge fan of the team, it bugs me.  Then, you try and talk crap about how my team sucked, but know nothing about the sport (Real fans know all about other teams, not just there own, plus have good knowledge about who is in their own farm system.)  If you have been a Rays fan since 1998 AND have been to a significant number of games, then you have my respect and congratulations on a great season, despite the outcome.
20081111195340AAFRK1m	Sports;Football (American)	Who do you think will on Thanksgiving Day the Lions or Titans? How would you react if the Lions won?	I'm saying the Detroit Lions will win this game is because they finally proved to me that they have a solid quarterback named Daunte Culpepper and Calvin Johnson will make the circus catches in this game.    Final Prediction Score:    Lions 34  Titans 24      Also I think the defense will stop the run and be placed number one that week. If the Lions beat the Titans I will laugh hysterically at how bad the Titans did.       I would react in humor and happy that the Lions were optimistic to show they are contenders and are ready for the SuperBowl in the year 2010.

Celtics have been playing rather sluggish and hopefully they underestimate the Knicks and the Knicks come out on top.      Knicks proved tonight in a loss that we can contend w/ the best as they had the Mavericks reeling. Yes, the Mavs are on the slumping end, but irregardless by season's end they will be a 50 win team.      Hopefully, Knicks win that would be a HUGE + if they can beat and or contend w/ the champions.

20090130192602AAjQ6VG	Sports;Basketball	Do Laker fans take the power rankings too seriously.?	"There was quite a reaction to last week's No. 5 ranking for the best team in the Western Conference. Irate e-mails came in all week from Lakers fans (who take these rankings much too seriously) all over the world.      Those Kobe-holics dreamed up numerous different conspiracy theories as to why their beloved purple and gold would be ranked so preposterously low, but the real reasoning was pretty simple. They lost. Specifically, they lost two straight games, and because one of those was to the Spurs, San Antonio was No. 4, even though they were five games behind L.A. in the standings."

20090130192429AAYkg4Y	Sports;Basketball	Who else sees this player comparison? ?	You else is reminded that Brandon Roy is  a lesser version to the great Alex English?      English, although not in my time period. I have seen videos of him and have been told that he was the most graceful player to ever grace the basketball courts. He completely dominated the 80's w/ the most scoring titles of that decade. He had the same moves over and over again and the game came, so simple to him and it looked like it was in slow mo or something.      That is what I feel about Roy. The game comes so simple to him it feels, like Englishesque. Roy does the same moves over and over again and no one can stop it to no avail.

Also, dont u think its mean that when a wrestler becomes heel, every1 hates them, and turns their backs at them? backstabbing them?

The reason I'm asking this is because Ben is very good at moving around in the pocket and avoiding sacks, especially in the fourth quarter.

I am only 13 and I have only been snowboarding for a year and I have started doing these tricks in November, some I learned just last weekend! So I rented a snowboard last year to try it out and it was awesome! I got my own board, the k2 vavavoom and I got good pretty fast. I have learned to do a backside boardslide like the second day of the season and I have been doing them throughout the season. At first, I went up 50-50 and then turned to the boardslide, but like 2 weekends ago I learned to just jump into the position. I can also do most rails, just the ones that you ride up to, not the ones that you have to jump on to. I can do a boardslide on rails, which I like better than boxes. I just learned how to do 180s off boxes and rails and I can land them. I can also go up the rail 50-50, turn my board to the boardslide and land switch. It is really fun. I still can't do a frontside boardslide but I think that I am going to learn tomorrow and Sunday. There is a log in my side yard that I jump over and I can do 180s, indy grabs, and stalefish grabs. I can also do tail presses on the runs just for fun. I want to learn how to do a butter sometime. So am I good or not. How long do you think it will take for me to get good. Please don't be mean. :)

My friends and I have small MMA fights (with all the protection we can have) and I can get out of the grappling he tries on me when I'm on bottom, but I can usually overpower him on the ground.      Now, when I'm on top, what are some techniques I could use to get him into submission? I'm really good at using my weight/momentum to keep him down and from doing anything, especially with his legs, but I can't seem to figure out how to get him into submission.      I've tried a take down and then moving to the back and forcing submission by a choke hold, but I'm usually on top and just stalling.      If you have any videos, that would also help. I looked on youtube, but couldn't find any for my specific need.      Thanks.

20090130170400AA4VsOG	Sports;Basketball	Who completely agrees with the all-star rosters?	Seriously? No Ray Allen!? He's playing better than Paul Pierce this year, no offense to Pierce or anything, but Allen has been the most consistent and he's one of the most if not the most efficient guards in the NBA. I don't agree with Jameer Nelson, I feel like his allstar selection is a bit premature. He's still not better than a lot of other guards in the NBA, I mean his team is having a great run, but he's just not at that level.       And Mo Williams, he's been playing great ball, how can he not be on the all star reserves when Nelson is. I think Allen deserves it a bit more than Mo, so if I had to switch out Jameer for one person it'd be Allen, but Mo definitely deserves it. Especially since Devin Harris and Danny Granger are on losing teams. Winning teams used to get more players because everyone was making a sacrifice and not getting as much individual accolades. *But I do have to agree and make a concession that Granger and Harris are playing exceptional and are for sure solid all stars.      What about David West making it? That selection makes me the maddest. He does not deserve it. 100% does not! He's not playing at an all star level at all, if anyone deserves his spot it's Al Jefferson. I know they're a losing team, but they're the best team in January and Jefferson is one of the players every team has to double, sometimes triple team. It's an injustice to have DWest over big Al.       And Rashard Lewis..seriously.. he's not playing better than other forwards. This one is ridiculous! Lewis is good, but come on! So many people were mad when the Pistons had 4 players and it should be the same with the Magic. This is just because they're winning and only because of that. No other reason.       Ok, so I make a few contradictions to myself, it's hard to explain how I feel about this, but the main point is: Lewis, Nelson, DWest don't deserve to be on that list. Allen, M.Williams and Al Jefferson do. Anyone else agree?

I can carve and don't have trouble with blue squares. Not the fast person on the runs but I can go down them.       I'm looking for a good snowboard that will last me a few seasons. Don't really expect to do much if any park stuff so I'm guessin an all mountain / freeride board is the type I'm looking for. I'm willing to spend around $350 for a board but obviously wouldn't be against gettin a cheaper one. After renting a variety of sizes I that I prefer a 155cm board.
