Why do old married men always stare at young girls? Is it wrong that we confronted him in public with his wife?   My friends and I were going out to dinner and this disgusting old white man he must have been at least in his late 40's or 50's kept staring at every girl that walked by and his wife didn't even notice. She was innocently talking to him and he was responding while staring at girls half his age. What a pig. I am Muslim so I was covered up even when he was trying to smile at me I ignored him...but my friend was wearing a short black dress with her back turned against him-shes blonde- and he kept staring at her rear end. We finally went up to him and told him to start looking at his wife and not as girls his daughters age. As he we walked away we could tell his wife started to yell at him and kicked him under the table. Its disgusting.

20090307170049AAlhMHU	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Hmmmm.....How would you react?	Last night I was thinking and a thought popped into my head. I have no idea where it came from. Maybe it was from all the espresso I had.      I am going to tell you something that drives my family and some of my friends nuts.      I do not ask questions if I do not want to know the answers and I do not need to know certain things because I just do not need to know. Let me explain.      My friends and family were at my house, a package arrives for me and I do not open it right away. I have no idea what it is in it. I said I will open it later. Everyone wanted to know. I said, you can open it and find out what is in it but there is one thing, you cannot tell me what it is. No hint, nothing. Think about it.      Which can you handle more? Not knowing what is in the package or knowing what is in it but seeing me and not telling me about it. Think.       They asked me if it was driving me crazy not knowing. I said no.      I walked out the room and I came back in 10 minutes. I noticed that the package was opened ( by my sister ) and everyone knew. They let me know that they knew. I said I do not and please do not tell me.      I put the package on the counter, all wrapped up, and in less that 48 hours, people told me what was in the package.      Which one are you? You know how I am.      Can you handle not opening a gift that is wrapped so nice for you? What if it is for someone else? Do you need to know even more? What if you open it but you cannot tell the person and you see them everyday?      Think.      That is the thought that popped inside me head.      One more thing, are you wondering what was in the package that I got?

20090307175746AAEUwse	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Who is the best present-day actor in your opinion?	I'm interested in knowing because some people recall the day when they first saw someone as big as Brando acting. And they usually comment on how they had never seen such a raw, electrifying performance. Not just him, mind you. But actors like Gregory Peck and Humphrey Bogart.   Personally, I don't know if currently anyone matches their ability but I know there are a lot of actors such as Daniel Day-Lewis, Gary Oldman, Sean Penn, etc. that are considered rather legendary in their own standing. But who do you think has left a huge imprint for future generations?

Hi there, I walked into my living room today and my Dad was watching Access Hollywood, and it was in the middle trailer of what I think was a movie trailer that looked really good.       All I saw was there was a guy, who meets a girl who has a boyfriend, and the guy looks like he's falling for the girl, and then later on it looks like he's falling for the boyfriend instead.       The boyfriend has a beard, the guy is cleanshaven , and I want to say the girl is blonde.       Thanks.

Well, guess what??? My life is a misery business. I've been abused by my mother my whole life. I'm 15 now and I deserve independence. She has been abusing me since I was a little kid. She'd beat me up just because she wanted to w/o any valid reason and she says things that really hurt my feelings. I'm very open minded so I tend to absorb everything she says in. She says that I'm a shameless b**ch who's not her daughter and she told me to walk around the streets naked. She told me that no one will ever like me because I'm deluded which I'm not. She told me that she hates me more than anything in this world. Yesterday she found out that I'm not in any honors classes and she made a huge deal out of it. I told her that it doesn't mater because they give extra credits in honors classes but they only do one or two extra questions. I have a 90+ average for all my classes but she's not happy. She has beaten me up for that. I feel like screaming!!! but I can't..I buried my head on my pillow and cried for hours. Out of anger, rage, depression and what not..She won't let me make any friends and like I said, she says that everyone will hate me(which they don't..). She thinks that I have no feelings. She doesn't get the fact that I'm a human and my feelings get hurt when she says negative comments about me, like i'm stupid, i'm ugly, i'm shameless and everything else. Once my cousin told me to run away from home because he knew what she does to me. She didn't support me at all when I cried for months and months when I was in 7 and 8th grade. I got bullied badly during that time. Sometimes I feel like killing myself. I tried once..I was gonna suicide myself but I was too scared and my mom told me that I'm gonna go to hell.    Now, I've decided to talk to my school counselor about this on Monday and my mom won't let me do my homework. I don't like going to school without my hw done . I feel ashamed and stupid. The reason why she won't let me do my hw is because I didn't take any honors classes..      My dad won't even talk to me and he's even worse...         I always wanted her to have a daughter who's trashy, does drugs, drinks, stays out all night, punk and stuffs so she'd know how lucky she is to have someone like me..      she moved me out of canada just so that I could get away from my cousins and friends..they were nice and down-to-earth      thank you guys for ur support..

I really like more mellow rock but it's still pretty "rocky (?)" I guess like Velvet Revolver, I guess.  I like sad songs but you can give me anything.  This would still fall in rock but I like Evanescence as well.      I also like people like Elton John and Billy Joel-I really don't know what genre they would be considered in but they're timeless classics.   But you can give me other genres as well I can like anything as long as I think it's good.  You can give me R&B, etc but I just won't like a lot of them.  And these songs don't just have to be love they can be about anything but if you know a great rock love song please write it thanks.

20090307202420AAjrqEs	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	How do I tell all these men to fxck off?	Aye-yo, I've got a problem here.       So, basically on my myspace, I am listed as single. There are tons and tons of guys who are doing those myspace searches for chicks and they're all telling me they want serious relationships with me. I've gotten a ton of guys give me their number and email addresses - and I'm NOT interested. Half of these guys are fugs and they're not my type. I mean, I've gotten a few messages from totally normal guys who understood that I wasn't interested and they left me alone.      However, today, there's this one dude, who is really freaking me out. I was out at my cousin's house tonight and I got offline for awhile because I had to go home and they live like almost an hour away. So, I got offline for an hour and this guy was freaking out. He sent me like five messages saying "Hey babe, where did you go? Why won't you reply?" He sent me a friend request and then I denied it. Then he sent another one. And I told him I didn't want relationships with guys I don't know on myspace and he's like "yyyyyyyyyyyyyy?" Dude can't even fxckin spell!       Like, I am not trying to sound conceited. I've just got a very "unique" look about myself that a lot of guys are after and I'm starting to get annoyed because all these pervs on myspace are hitting on me.      And like, when I click on their profiles, I see all their friends are attractive females. I mean, really, do these guys actually think I am DUMB enough to play those riciculous head games with them online? Fxckin' retards. lol.      So - my question - should I change my sexual orientation and say I am transgendered or lesbian and flip em' all off? And how do I tell them nicely that I am just not that interested?

20090307221144AAkdeKV	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Starting to get depressed?	i'm starting to get really depressed about the whole dating thing. i just ended my first real "serious" (it was only one month, but it had really been going on longer than that) relationship a couple months ago, and i'm beginning to doubt that i can have another relationship at all. i'm not the type of guy girls tend to be interested in - i'm the "nice" guy, and i tend to be pretty quiet and reserved until you get to know me.      i pretty much never even talk to girls. i just tried to start up a conversation on facebook with a girl i know recently, and that was a miserable failure. i never really get the opportunity to talk to girls (i'm in college right now), and i don't really know what to do about that.      I feel like i'm pretty much just gonna be alone from now on, and that really sucks. the one thing i want the most right now is to have a girl to be with and to be able to talk to, and it seems like i just can't have it. that's all it would take for me to be happy, but right now, i'm kind of miserable.

20090307202821AAzkpLo	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Are rich/upper class people naturally smarter and/or more attractive physically?	Because historically richer people could choose who they married i.e the more attractive or smarter people so therefore their children would be more attractive because they get their parents traits. This would be continually improved on over time. So would this make richer people (those who are from wealthy backgrounds not those who have made all of it themselves) more attractive because of their genes?          before you ask I'm not actually from a wealthy background so this doesn't describe me.

The film wasn't bad or anything, in the sense that it was well cast, well acted, had good script and story etc. but it followed the same formula as Forrest Gump therefore felt like I had seen it before and it was a let down especially after 3 hours of it.      Other peoples thoughts?
20090307231720AAJ3Rlf	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Do you know what show this is?	Its on Fox,      A brilliant yet cynical Phd, played by an English actor, who believes that 'Everybody Lies'. He and his team of experts solve one or more mysteries every episode using their specialized skills. The main character though has something special, different from everyone else, though his protege(s) may have some potential.
20090307225029AAlbIzB	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	Please tell me what song this is!!! Can you find it?	Okay, now I'm going to give you the link for the song, but I swear I am not trying to say anything political, but I simply LOVE this song and I really want to buy it, but I can't find it anywhere. I've tried googling the lyrics and came up with nothing.       The link is to a youtube video about supporting gay marriage. This video was shown in my pysch. class and it made me cry, cause the song is so beautiful.      *note* at the beginning there is a song title-this is NOT the current song, but the original.       Please help!   10 points for the first/best answer. Thanks!      link:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eay1mxFSR...

20090307235104AAwgLHv	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Yahoo Live disscussion?	i just wondering this. this might be long, but just read it all. you may think of something.      you know back when chat rooms roamed the lands, and you were logged on into on, and the topic was always the same: Sex, Idiots, and Sexual Insults. i mean, before the "OMG LOL" and the "F*** u *expletive* chat room tom-foolery. i got sick of that and so did everyone else, as regular chat rooms were abandoned. but now, after a year of Y!A, Online multiplayer games, and human interaction, that a new chat room like idea has come to my mind. after that, i decided to tell you guys. "Live discussion?" you know, like the chat rooms of now, expect without excessive immaturity, and a more discussion like feel. maybe simple subjects, like colors, and cars, to more political ideas, such as Obama/Mccain, Global warming, the worlds new economy. i feel that such "live discussions" are more subtle, and may enhance to a little something that has been striven for forever.  connecting with people wth different views into society. me, being a boarding school, i feel that connecting with more people from different areas. i go to school in a secluded mountain range, and i live with a bunch of copiers, not much diversity (in ideas and tastes). while im at boarding school i have only about 10 different people to talk to, and the internet seems a like a good place to just have a basic disscussion or something with. now, i know this will not be able to find friutiton. mainly because: humans think that most of the time thier view is the one and only correct view. and then arrogance and immaturity soon follow. if this worked, maybe, just maybe, tchat rooms could go back to thier old, and promised state, a virtual mall or a rally of sorts. sometimes it's only the slightest conversations which change the world.      phew. let out a lot. so what do you guys think. same idea? or totally bogus?

20090307225955AAJ0P5n	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	How do you think Marilyn Monroe got killed?	Do you think it was Overdosing on pills or do you think she was murdered by Robert Kennedy? I think it was Robert,but then again it could have been the pills. When I read a book about Marilyn,and when the book talks about how she was addicted to pills and sometimes would miss counting her pills then I would think,she overdosed on pills. Then when another book will talk about Robery Kennedy and how somebody was over at her house the night she died (besides her housekeeper Eunice Murray),then I would think that Robert Kennedy hired someone to kill Marilyn. I don't know the right answer of how she died,but I would sure love to know though. Whatever the case may be,she didn't deserve to die. All she wanted was to be loved and to have a wonderful family that she never got to have and I hope wherever she's at,that she;s happy now.

This blackness is surrounding   And the bloody tears I'm crying are falling like I'm dying   So what am I gonna do now?      Ain't no bother trying to change this   Time is slowly passing   and my life is fading away   I'm bound by the ways of my family   If I could but I can't oh yeah I would leave   But life isn't so simple   Rules can be broken but someones gotta pay      But I feel like I'm really trying   I guess its not right until I'm suffering   I'm running but I'm slowing   Life's a pretty thing, but I'm sinking   Where do the waves fall?      Peace wouldn't help a thing   and now I'm wondering is it really worth it?   All this pain I'm enduring   is it really worth it... for a friend?   And baby to days the day I'm gonna die   All these chants are beating down on me   Hoping I'll break down and cry   Up in the clouds of eternity   Maybe it would be better   and I could act how I wanna be

The movie sort of cross cuts between the actual movie scenes and then the lady reflecting on it as if shes telling the story and when shes telling the story shes all dressed in white and sitting in a white chair and the whole room is white. Yeah sorry it's so long but I really need the name of the movie - I think it might possibly have the word "wedding" in the title but yeah not sure ... ANY IDEAS??? =]

20090307230116AAtaHkd	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	What's the big deal with the Jonas Brothers?	I'm just asking, why are people making such a huge deal over them? They are nothing special, their type of music has been done before, and it has been done better. It seems like all these girls go insane over them cause they are "hot" apparently, and they could care less about the actual music they play. They're tools in my opinion.

20090307235306AAy8Xzv	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Perfect blue unanswered?	These first seven are not my own personal questions although they might as well be it's as if the person had read right out of my mind,   and that we've both come to the same foggy conclusion of perfect blue. The movie was WHACK ( in a good way) and as great as it was I don't plan on watching it over just for the sake of answers (maybe i should have), but either way I'm positive that many others out there are just as puzzled, so now they can do a yahoo or google search and find their answers like i hoping to but couldn't, so if there's a perfect blue fan out there who completely understands the story could you kindly answer these questions:               1. Did Mima really dress up as a pizza boy and kill that man (think he was the photographer or something)? Or was it Rumi/Mr. Me-Mania/other? I've worked out (in my own mind) that either he was the only one she killed (or did she kill Me-Mania too with that blow to the head?), or she didn't kill anyone.      2. So she started believing that she was her TV show character? And she started going crazy, even before the stalking got really bad and everything? I don't understand why her hallucination turned out to be Rumi. Her insanity didn't have anything to do with Rumi's insanity, did it?      3. Was Mr. Me-Mania the murderer of the scriptwriter and the others, or was Rumi the murderer?      4. Who was on the stage with Cham when they were doing their concert (after Mima left Cham)? If it was Rumi, then why did the fans get so excited?      5. Was Me-Mania the writer of Mima's Room, or was it Rumi? (I think this actually may have been revealed in the film, but I'm not sure.)      6. Did Me-Mania send the fax and the exploding letter? Or was that Rumi in her Mima personality?      7. All those times Mima "woke up," was she being drugged by Rumi or something? Were any of those scenes before "waking up" real?      Oh, man. I just realized that I actually don't get a lot of stuff about this movie. I mean, I understand that Mima, Rumi, and Me-Mania were all pretty crazy, but only Mima got a happy ending. And Rumi was pretending to be Mima to Me-Mania online, and Mima kept hallucinating about her former pop idol self, etc. But I just don't know about some of the details...      Sorry for the long read but there's still more, now these are some of my questions:      1. Who made the website Mi-mania or Rumi?   Because Rumi was the one who explained what a link was and setup   the computer and connection for Mima, did Rumi purposely set up Mima having her read a very anally accurate (or just freaky) diary description of her every move and even emotion off the web before she started passing out, then was Rumi making new thoughts off of Mima's consciouses doubts although they haven't ever been spoken of or even crossed Mima's mind, unless Mima was hallucinating about the other Mima. Was all this because Rumi tried to get Mima back as a pop idol? Assuming this, why would Rumi have been so anal about Mima being a pop idol instead of an actress, Rumi also always regarded Mima as a pop idol in every discussion about her acting carreer with   the director and writer and never as an actress, like for the rape scene, she cried because she ruined her image as a pop idiol, even though Mima was willing to give that image up for her career as an actress, although yes Mima later had doubts about which way her career was going, and seemed frustrated by the rape scene and nude photographs.      2.  Why did Mima keep passing out, and why couldn't she remember    anything, or was the the stories time-line out of snyc and not in chronological order?      3. Why did Mima have a dream that she was the one who killed the photographer? Its hard to imagine she had dreamt of killing the photographer the night he died, that's a little out of the ordinary, some paranormal influences in the movie should i assume? Or did she dream this after the photographers death was known to her, that Rumi set up the bloody shirt in Mima's room.      4. When did Mima's room change. Who changed it, Rumi?   Mima mentioned the Rumi hadn't visited in so long once, and Rumi replied that she visited just yesterday. What the hell was that all about? Did Rumi accidentaly reveal that she was there the day before without Mima even noticing, or was Mima under the pressure and lost in thought not knowing who she was unware of her surroundings, losing memory, was Mima going insane?       5. I wasn't fully alert through whole movie, but at first I thought that Rumi was Mima's mother, then manager, and then unsure because of how much control she had over Mima, she also argued that Mima by becoming an actress would through away years of training of her singing lessons. Which leads to asking why Rumi had a disorder thinking she was really Mima, and then trying to kill the real Mima. Was she upset with Mima becaus of the career change and ruing of image?         7. Just before the part that Mima called the leading actress ( sorry don't know the leading actresses real

20090307223939AADO9YQ	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist... how real is it?	Hello... So i'm 16. I'm pretty mature for my age, and i think i'm a pretty good person and i know who i am. I love indie (non-popular) music, i'm really not mean at all, and i'm a whole lot of other things. The other day i watched "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" and i was shocked how good it was. I think i thought it was so good because the "Nick" character is just like me in about every way... so i could relate to the movie. Now, i've never had a girlfriend (I don't live near a city, i'm not that outgoing, etc.) But i was wondering if there are in fact girls like Norah in the world. Nick fell in love with Norah, so with me being like him, in a way i did too. She epitomized my ideal girlfriend... very plain, funny, not super hot, not trying to "fit in," very deep and genuine, and above all, a great sense of music... (pretty much all the songs in that movie i liked, several of which i already knew. If there aren't any girls like that at my age, could there be girls like that when i'm in college?... when girls have had a chance to figure themselves out and not care about what everybody else thinks anymore. Thanks!      By the way, this isn't a desperate post to meet girls... This has just been bugging me and i was hoping that my dreams could possibly one day see a reality.      Thanks

20061210071905AAlSDQ9	Entertainment & Music;Movies	La storia di "Audrey Rose" film del 1977 di Robert Wise è vera?	Trama:Nel corpo di Ivy Templeton, bambina undicenne, si è insediata l'anima di Audrey Rose, morta all'età di cinque anni in un incidente d'auto. Questo, perlomeno, è quel che sostiene il padre della defunta, Elliot Hoover, che un lungo soggiorno in India ha convertito alla dottrina della reincarnazione. L'insistenza, fastidiosa per i Templeton, con cui egli vuol dimostrare la sua tesi, costringe i genitori di Ivy a trascinare Hoover in tribunale. Per risolverlo, il giudice affida il caso a uno psichiatra, che, con l'ipnosi, accerta che Ivy è davvero la reincarnazione di Audrey Rose. Durante l'esperimento, purtroppo, Ivy muore, ma ora i suoi genitori, ormai convinti che Hoover aveva ragione e sanno che la sua anima non andrà perduta.

El día de nuestra boda fuimos de luna de miel en nuestro carro    tirado por la yegua.    Andamos algunos metros y la yegua tropezó.    Mi marido le dijo con voz firme a la yegua:    Uno.    Pero unos    metros más adelante la yegua    ropezó de nuevo.          Mi marido miró a la yegua y dijo:    Dos.       La tercera vez que se tropezó, sacó su pistola y le pegó cinco tiros.    Yo totalmente sorprendida le recriminé: Pero que hijo de la $#&$#&$#& ( /%    eres, ?por qué la mataste?    Mi marido me miró y dijo:       Uno ....

Poor Shilpa - she has the virtually comotose Ken and Jermaine for company now. No wonder she's crying! But it gets worse, love. You have Jade and family for company in a minute! I feel really sorry for anyone who has to live with Jade - except perhaps Ken - he is pretty odd himself. He can explain The Devils to Jade now - after doing so so successfully to Danielle. Good thing Danielle and Jade aren't in the same house - who'd be the more stupid? I can't see Jermaine or Shilpa having much in common with Jade - maybe it's time for them to consider giving up this experiment - they don't really need any more fame anyway, or money, surely?!

20070801051828AAwlJGv	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Answeriani help me!?	sono mesi che cerco di trovare un titolo! Ai primi di febbraio ho visto una decina di secondi di un film trasmesso in prima serata da una TV che si chiama Canale Italia. Ho cercato dappertutto, ho addirittura contattato l'emittente via e-mail (che non mi ha risposto) Allora questa è la mossa della disperazione: vi descrivo quel poco che ho intravisto, e se c'è qualche anima buona che ha la soluzione mi aiuti... un ragazzo è inseguito da un auto in una specie di boschetto, l'auto continua la sua folle corsa fra buche e rovi cercando di braccarlo. In auto c'è un tipo cogli occhiali da sole (somigliava a Lou Diamond Phillips, ma non è lui xkè ho controllato la sua filmografia...a menochè non sia un cameo) il film è americano e dalle immagini sembra anche di qualità, si non un filmetto. Per qlk secondo ho intravisto una radio che potrebbe avere una parte importante nel film... chessò potrebbe essere magica o indemoniata. Lo sò che è da disperati ma mi basta anche un indizio. GRAZIE CMQ

20070714191600AAwEupY	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Name that Bollywood song with Anil Kapoor in that film.?	There's a tune in my head from a Bollywood film. I don't remember the title of the film or what's it about, but I know that Anil Kapoor is in it and I think he's singing it solo. I remember a side shot in the film where Anil Kapoor bobs his head back when he sang the start of the chorus. I don't remember any of the lyrics, but I know it's a romantic Hindi song. The film is probably from the early-mid 1990s because I remember hearing that song when I was younger. I know this is all vague, but it's all I can remember. I looked everywhere - dishant.com, Youtube etc - but I couldn't find anything (though it could be a well-known song). The closest I can think of to compare the song with is 'Payalay Chunmun'. I'd really appreciate a list of possible songs. I know this is all very vague, but it's all the information I can give.       Those who can't help but say useless things just to gain points...  don't bother answering!

I heard a song on the radio today, and I was trying to pick out some lyrics to look up later, but I'm pretty sure most of the song is just the lead singer not using words, just singing the guitar part to harmonize. The only words I caught was in like the second line of the chorus where he sings, practically yells jesus christ. Somewhere in the song I might have also heard come and play. It's a rock song, and I don;t really think it's religious. It was on 107.7 The End. Any help would be great.      P.S. It kind sounded like Jane's Addiction, or Alice In Chains, but I don;t think it was them.

20070826171651AAMo3lm	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	A los padres, tarde o temprano les suele llegar el momento de las preguntas “incómodas”. (Chiste)?	La nena de 8 a?os se acerca a su padre y le pregunta:      - Papi, ?qué significa pene?.      Cuando oye “la” palabra, el padre se desorienta un poco, le corre un escozor por el cuerpo, esperaba tener que hablar a su “princesita” sobre “eso” unos a?os más tarde, y un par de segundos después, al reaccionar, piensa: “Realmente, con la televisión que tenemos, Internet y demás cosas, los chicos están cada vez más avivados, así que es preferible que le explique de una vez la verdad sobre éste tema, sin vueltas, y listo”:      - Mira, los hombres y las mujeres son diferentes. Las mujeres tienen vagina y los hombres pene, que al estar erecto, se mete en la vagina de la mujer. Después de algunos movimientos ahí adentro, sale un líquido que se llama semen. Si se junta con una cosita chiquitita que la mujer tiene en su interior que se llama óvulo, después de 9 meses como máximo, nace un bebé. (Traga saliva y le pregunta) Por qué mi amor?, dónde dijeron esa palabra?.
