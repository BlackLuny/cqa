20090304095855AASSM3U	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Anyone know the name of this movie?	I saw this terrible movie a few years ago (less than 5), but I can't think of  the name and it's making me crazy. Here's all I remember:      A man and his teen daughter move to a house in a semi-rural area. The daughter is sulky about it, and pissed with her dad. She meets a brooding dark-haired boy (he's got kind of a Nine Inch Nails look) in the new town, but he quickly becomes obsessed with her; at one point he tells her very firmly that she's his boyfriend. She's like, "ok? whatever..." but he gets more and more obsessed, and one night he and 2 friends show up at the  house and start menacing her & her dad. The girl calls the sheriff, and when he drives up you think everything will be cool, but as he gets out of his truck, one of the boys just caps him in the head! Somehow they get into the house, and the girl barricades herself into a room. At one point the 3 boys are inside at the top of some stairs. One boy starts to argue with the ringleader– "should we be doing this?" They start to fight, and the ringleader ends up semi-accidentally throwing his friend over the balcony, which kills him. The other boy shuts the hell up. Later he gets killed somehow, too. Later still, the main boy finds the girl locked into a room with an interior window. He writes "BURN" on the glass with his finger, and sets the house on fire. I don't remember how she escapes, but in the end I think she kills him.      What's the name of the movie?   (And no, it's not "Fear" with Mark Wahlberg– it's much more recent.)

This is just like a 'first draft' so any amendment suggestions would be greatly appreciated :)      I'm thinking of calling it '93 (other suggestions please?)      She moved into my building, moved into my heart.   Hair-brained and clumsy, boy she made me laugh.   Bright blue eyes, hair like an autumn leaf.   She stayed for the day, left for the week.      You gave me no answers.   I had to read it in the sunday paper.   You'd understand, you'd realize.   If you'd have seen it through my eyes.   You'd understand, you'd realize.   If you'd have looked in to her eyes.      Where did you go, what have you done?   I know you, it can't have been that wrong.   But you got sent away, far from my reach.   And now i've been wandering, since '93   Since '93      You gave me no answers.   I had to read it in the sunday paper.   You'd understand, you'd realize.   If you'd have seen it through my eyes.   You'd understand, you'd realize.   If you'd have looked in to her eyes.      You left me alone, I got confused.   I swear I saw your face, on the news.   I don't think you meant to, big mistake.   Now here I am, but I think i'm too late.      Because.   You gave me no answers.   I had to read it in the sunday paper.   You'd understand, you'd realize.   If you'd have seen it through my eyes.   You'd understand, you'd realize.   If you'd have looked in to her eyes.      Her eyes, blue like the sky.   Fresh like the sea, where I now lie.   She didn't force me, I forced myself.   It was just an exuse, that she left.      I've seen her every day now, since '93.   I find death, to be much like a dream.   Only it's better, cause you're all I see.   All I ever see.      Thanks for reading. And as I said, suggestions on ammendments, and a title would be greatly appreciated.   x

20090304044944AAXIbIj	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Settle a debate: What's cheaper in clothing, big sizes or small sizes?	Often in clothing shops i have seen large sizes sell for cheaper than smaller sizes. My woman and her sister argue saying that the large sizes are dearer. Perhaps its different in women's and men's clothing but certainly in men's it appears the larger ones sell cheaper. It would cost more to make large sizes perhaps because it takes more fabric but from a retail point of view they buy in from a manufacturer who would be selling at least 300 of the items,all various sizes. The large ones would not sell as fast as 'average' so they discount them to get rid of them. Am i correct or am i wrong because 'its dearer to make them so the shops sell them more expensive'? Stupid debate i know but still.

SPOILERS, DON'T READ UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN ALL EPISODES UP UNTIL 17         With only 3 episodes left to go, I can't help but wonder how on Earth (no pun intended) they are going to close it. I really, really hope it's not going to be an open ending, that would just be mean. But if in the 17th episode nothing happens except Boomer taking off with Hera and Rosling collapsing (dying?), I'm beginning to wonder if they're out of inspiration.       What can they do to close off the season in order to leave all the fans with a satisfied feeling, to give a worthy ending for such a great show?      Also: the piano man, could that be the last cylon, who supposedly got killed by Cavil (I think his name was Daniel)? Ellen did mention he was an artist, and he played "All along the watchtower" with Starbuck.      And finally: are there any story lines they started but didn't finish? Are all the people they introduced (the important ones from previous seasons) going to be in the final few episodes, or are they going to leave some people's end in the dark?

20090304071850AAc00sq	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Is this a bit much for day time television?	I am watching channel 3 at the moment in the uk at half 3 and they are talking about sex toys, vibrators and sex without blurring anything out. Kids are going to be watching this at this time of day and I don't think it is appropriate they are going into a lot of detail about sex. Normally things like this would be blurred. Is this a bit much? tv has got to a point where you can't say the word "black" but it is ok to talk very openly about sex no matter who is watching. I may sound like a prude but it doesn't bother me, I am thinking about the underage kids which are getting ideas at an early age it is no wonder we have 13 year old dads!

If I remember rightly it was on a CBBC advert if that helps? haha      They've just brought a new song out which sounds really similar with the same kind of beepy sound but more happy.. (lol??)      If anyone could name the band or one of the songs I would be so HAPPPYYY!!!!

Every night he took a stroll around the house to make sure everything was all right. One night he could her laughing coming from his youngest daughters room. When he reached the door of his second daughter he could hear her crying. There were no sounds coming fromhis eldest daughters.      The next day when they were gathered around the breakfast table, h said to his youngest daugher "I heard yu laughing last night as i was walking past your door. Why was that?" She answered, "Thats because you taught me to laugh when someone was making me happy"      He then asked his second daughter why she was crying. She answered, because you taught me to cry when someone was making me sad".      He then said to his oldest daughter "I didn't hear anything from you", to which she replied: "That's because you taught me not to talk with my mouth full..."

20090304074025AAWgkR8	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	American Idol - how will the vote go?	(1) rank the contestants in order of most votes;   (2) list who will advance;   (3) list 4 wildcard contestants      I think the voting will come in as follows:      (1) Jorge Nunez - I always thought he was pretty good but he had a fantastic performance that surpassed my expectations.   (2) Lil Rounds - was one of my "Top 3" after watching the Hollywood portion along with Adam Lambert and Jamar (who amazingly was not selected).  She will go very far.   (3) Scott McIntyre - I'm really not too impressed with him but he has received huge amounts of air time and has a good story.   (4) Felicia Barton.  She was doing amazing until she butchered every single high note and exposed herself as having no range.  Judges gave her very good feedback.   (5) Kristen McNamara.  I really like her alot.  She should have chose a more modern song.   (6) Ju'Not Joyner.  Him singing "Hey There Delilah" pissed me off because it sparked those memories of Jamar's amazing rendition of the same song in Hollywood.  I just pray they are saving Jamar for next season so he won't be competing against their golden boy, danny gokey.     (7) Arianna Afsar.  The most disappointing of the night.  I had high hopes for her and she choose an awful song.  She is very talented and will be back for the wildcard show.  She better tone down the "I know I'm really good looking but tell me I can sing" routine as that was really annoying and she isn't that good looking.   (8) Von Smith.  The Clay Aiken comparison was quite a stretch.  Appearance-wise there is a slight resemblence but vocally they're not even on the same planet.   (9) Alex Wagner.  I didn't think it was as bad as the judges thought.  We all know he doesn't have the best voice so he did about as well as he could do and I actually kind of liked the growling sounds he used.  I also thought the performance was entertaining.   (10) Kendall Beard.  Cute Girl who will get some votes based upon that.   (11) Taylor Vaiananua.  She was good but nothing special or memorable and absolutely no personality.  Buh-Bye.   (12) Nathaniel.  I can't see anyone out there voting for this clown.  It was very gratifying to hear Simon and Kara compare him to Richard Simmons bc that is exactly what my wife and I were saying during his performance!      So getting thrugh tonight will be:   Jorge Nunez   Lil Rounds   Scott McIntyre      The 4 Wildcrads will be:   Arianna Afsar   Kristin McNamara   Felicia Barton   Ju'Not Joyner      Von Smith just gets edged out.

If you dont like the celebrity, why not just like, not answer the question and keep your opinions to yourself. I mean, people who love certain celebs arent going to change their opinion just cos you dont like that person, so whats the point?      Also, why do people hate them? They dont know them, and they make assumptions about them. I think its like, totally mean.      So yeah, why?

20090304072017AAPI3Sh	Entertainment & Music;Music;Blues	Better at soloing in minor pentatonic (blues)?	I'm a avid guitarist who's skill level falls between moderate and advanced, and I've bee playing for some time. I'm very familar with minor and major pentatonic scales, modes, etc. I've also been improving my "raking" technique to better my blues tone.      Now... I just want to get better at doing all the above.      I usually have a pretty good sense about what to play (scales, modes, etc) and when (over what chord progressions, etc), but unfortunately, I have recently come to the understanding that my picking technique is horrible... and having been playing constantly for almost 5 years now, I have quite some undoing to do.       I stick with bends and raking a lot to make up for my severe lack of speed when it comes to picking. I have extreme knowledge of the fretboard, and am frustrated I can't utilize it better by making those fast blues runs that a lot of guitarists (such as Slash) are able to perform effortlessly just because my hands are "out of sync", persay.       I would like to get some advice/techniques/exercises to help me improve this. ANYTHING that you can offer will be greatly appreciated!

20090304072047AAOq0Ru	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Is the Watchmen going to be a good movie for the casual movie-goer?	I generally don't like comic book movies; the more comic-book like, the worse they are for me. I found Sin City, for example, to be a dreadful bore. I liked Batman (1989) as a child and thought Batman Begins was good but The Dark Knight kind of lame. The Tobey Maguire Spider-Man films were also pretty boring. The way I understand it, this movie is a bit of a different take on the comic book movie, but does that mean it will appeal to a guy who doesn't like comic book movies nor most action films?

A Russian woman married a Canadian gentleman and they lived happily ever after in Toronto . The poor lady was not very proficient in English, but did manage to communicate with her husband. The real problem arose whenever she had to shop for groceries.                   One day, she went to the butcher and wanted to buy chicken legs. She didn't know how to put forward her request, and in desperation, clucked like a chicken and lifted up her skirt to show her thighs. Her butcher got the message, and gave her the chicken legs.                   Next day she needed to get chicken breasts, again she didn't know how to say it, and so she clucked like a chicken and unbuttoned her blouse to show the butcher her breasts. The butcher understood again, and gave her some chicken breasts.                   On the 3rd day, the poor lady needed to buy sausages. Unable to find a way to communicate this, she brought her husband to the store...

She killed the youngest sister when she was trying to put her shoe on but it was too small or something, and she kept pushing her foot in but it wouldn't go so she got angry, picked the girl up and dropped her onto the floor; killing her. Both her two sisters witnessed it, grew up a lot older and tried to open a case to get the stepmother charged for it.      Sorry for the long explanation, does anyone know what this film is called by any chance?      Thanks

20090304084951AAkBN4G	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Is it the dog or the dragon?	There has been quite a heated debate in my family about a relatively trivial matter, and I thought it might be interesting to get other opinions, so here I am. If you watch TV at all you have probably seen the Capital One commercial with all those fantasy creatures doing their banking, and at the end a woman with a dog on a leash pulls the dog away from a dragon and says "You leave him alone" is she talking to the dog or the dragon? Just wondering what everyone else thinks (I know, who cares...but isn't it fun to think about something besides the economy for a minute?)

20090304093219AApMmFR	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Story with a moral.(kind of funny)?	TRIP TO WAL-MART.... Yesterday I was at my local Wal-Mart buying a large bag of Purina dog chow for my loyal pet, Biscuit, the Wonder Dog and was in the checkout line when woman behind me asked if I had a dog. What did she think I had, an elephant? So since I'm retired and have little to do, on impulse I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, I was starting the Purina Diet again. I added that I probably shouldn't, because I ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms. I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pants pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so it works well and I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in line was now enthralled with my story.) Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no, I stepped off a curb to sniff an Irish Setter's *** and a car hit us both. I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard. Wal-Mart won't let me shop there anymore.       moral of this story      Better watch what you ask retired people. They have all the time in the world to think of crazy things to say.
20090304084216AAG0S5q	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Have you heard this joke before ?(kinda long)?	The Indian With One Testicle       There once was an Indian who had only one testicle and whose given name was 'Onestone'.       He hated that name and asked everyone not to call him Onestone.       After years and years of torment, Onestone finally       cracked and said, 'If anyone calls me Onestone       again, I will kill them!'       The word got around and nobody called        him that any more.       Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird       forgot and said, 'Good morning, Onestone.'       He jumped up, grabbed her and took her deep into       the forest where he made love to her all day and       all night. He made love to her all the next day,        until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.       The word got around that Onestone meant what        he promised he would do.       Years went by and no       one dared call him by his given name until a woman         named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being       away. Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was       overjoyed when she saw Onestone. She hugged him       and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.'       Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest,         then he made love to her all day, made love to her all       night, made love to her all the next day, made love to       her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die! Why ???      OH, come on . take a guess !!!       Think about it !!!       You're going to love this !!!      Everyone knows... You can't kill Two Birds with OneStone !!!

Everywhere i download this tune from, it sounds like it has been recorded way to loud and then recorded again at a lower volume. So when it hits the bass line, it sound so distorted its not worth putting into my new mix. But i love the tune.   Also im not too sure if its the cosmic gate remix or the original. Because when Tiesto plays it on "Elements Of Life", it says its the cosmic gate version, i download that and its not the same. I download "Tiesto ft. jes - everything ( Original )", its that one BUT its always distorted on the bass line...      Where can i get the original without the distortion?

It seems that Black Francis puts a lot of religious imagery into his songs, both with the Pixies and his solo material.  And his solo backing band is called "The Catholics."

20090304103332AAy6Z1A	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	"Great" composers: which for you, wear well/don't-those you use to listen to, but don't anymore?  Why?	This question is mostly directed toward the older/mature generation of classical music lovers; but anyone, please feel free to respond.           We all have our idiosyncratic tastes in music as in everything else in life.  I'm 74, and have been listening to classical music since I was about 6 yrs. old.           And have found that over the years, much music that I use to love to listen to, no longer holds any appeal for me.  Beethoven was one of my first loves; but now, I rarely listen to any of his compositions.  And it took me a long time before I came to an appreciation of Mozart and Bach: but they too have for the most part, gone by the board.           And I now find that, Wagner's music aside to which I never seem to tire of, I find myself listening repeatedly to pieces like Scriabin's "Poem of Ecstasy", Tchaikovsky's "Sleeping Beauty", de Falla's "El amor brujo" or some such.            What's been your experience?  Have you found that your taste in music has just mildly changed over the year, drastically, or not at all?

Borne on the air, lot of screams and the wails   Of the masses appointed to die.      Listen for the ...

20090304110157AAaLkC8	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Which reality shows do you take them as face value?	IMO, none. Majority of them are staged at ridiculous levels. The reality shows that are staged at least 50% of the time are The Bachelor, Survivor, and Big Brother. Those are the big three that are staged heavily.      Not as much, but American Idol too has its share of staging drama as well which can't stand as much as I love the show.      So, what did you think of The Bachelor shocker? Totally staged. I don't think Melissa was a plant, but I don't think she was completely blind-sided either. The whole thing with Jason reversing his decision 360 was completely staged. All in all, I am actually happy Jason chose Molly. They do make a great couple.

I hope they're kidding, otherwise, people in this country really are that sad lol It's a TV show! Do you believe this is real? It'd be like thinking professional wrestling is real fighting lol Of course it's staged. Even if it weren't, what's the big deal? They're good actors. That's why their on TV. You don't think Melissa's salary will help her get over this? Do you actually think ''Molly'' will be legally married to this guy? And if they are, how long do you think it'd last? I think what people need to do is get away from the TV and get back into reality.

20090304101530AAZCfQG	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Is Katharine McPhee's "My Destiny" too romantic a song to dedicate to one's twin sister?	My friend wants to dedicate a song to his twin sister. I couldn't think of any suggestions. What's a good song for a person who's always been by your side through everything?   He was thinking along the lines of Katharine McPhee's "My Destiny."   Will that do?   I mean, when people hear the word "destiny" they equate it with "soul mate." I told him I'm afraid it might make people think there are incestuous undertones to it.   Would that do for a brother-sister relationship? Katharine McPhee's "My Destiny," I mean.   Or maybe not?   My friends says he knows that, but he thinks it's the perfect song. He says he feels like it was his "destiny" to be her twin brother, and she his twin sister.   And he said that when he heard the line "how different life turned out to be," he thought to himself how different things would've been had they not grown up together, had he not known her, had she not been there for him through it all.   He says he couldn't imagine.   See, their parents are about to be divorced, and their dad is a drinker and a gambler. She's been there for him through all the drunk nights when father and son would fight.   And she would listen to him cry himself to sleep at night.   So he really wanted to dedicate something special for his sister. Should he go through with it?

20090304094909AADDb1l	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Analyze this relationship please!!?	I need help analyzing the problem in this situation:      Virgo woman, scorpio man been together for 2 years. He claims he has loved her since before they met apparently he used to stand outside everyday @ the sametime to see her walking home. Since they have been together they spend everyday afterwork together, when they are both off on the weekends the weekend is spent together. This is all at the insitance of the Scorpio, times she doesn't comply he says he is hurt and always refers to them as being married. He mentions that he wants to get her a ring, but hasn't made in steps in doing so, he also spoke of getting an apt together when his lease was up, but then he renewed the lease. Ms. Virgo still leaves @ home while she works and attends school. Ms. Virgo has kept quite sometimes but has pointed out the fact that he doesn't keep his word, which she finds hurtful b/c the things he says but doesn't do our kinda big when in a relationship. Ms.Virgo has tired of sleeping over, but taking all of her things when she leaves EVERYDAY. She has begun to think that perhaps she should just get her own place since he has not made any steps towards anything, she is so weary of his word now that when he says he wants to do something for her or with her she has begun to not believe any of it, she now doubts he truly loves her or ever really did, since he hasn't moved her in or proposed like he says he wants to. She has started to stay home more often, it is rare she will call him now, when he says something that normally would've created a argument she doesn't even respond. She has begun to breakup with him often, but it doesnt last b/c he will call again as soon as she hangs up and say just enough to keep her going. She refrains from saying she loves him, when he says it she says "ok". The sex is not as great anymore because of her growing lack of trust in him. She wants to fix it, but at this point she doesn't know what to do. Agin he swears he loves her and says it daily, and he tells her his reasons for his love yet somehow she thinks its a lie.   Is Ms.Virgo being played? Does he love her and maybe she should take the initiative on the direction things are going? Whats your opinions on whats going on and why?

20090304105037AAJiAIk	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Which society will you choose?	The first one does not have any technological advantages !   No computers    No music players    No t v   Nothing electric !   But it is a tight close community where everybody help each other out and feel supported !    Living in touch with nature by appreciating instead of constantly taking without giving back!   Women are strong here and have the same rights as men but also the same responsibilities !      Theres nothing to do unless you decide to do it yourself !   You get your own food , you make your own clothes but share it with everybody!      The second society its highly advanced with technology , more or less what we have now making it more comfortable to live    but their citizens are just out for themselves , they dont care about each other and would take advantage of you if necessary !   You are judged for what you have instead of for what you are and cant really trust anyone !   You have more options and possibilities to choose from       Which society will you choose and why?
20090304095509AAu2jwK	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Should Euthanasia be legalized? 10 points to best answer :):)?	And by legalized, I also mean regulated. Like it can only be administered by a select few doctors, and someone has to meet with a doctor and with a psychiatrist before being able to die, just to make sure they aren't depressed, but actually terminally sick.   I think it should be, because some people go through a lot of suffering when they're sick, and making them stay alive while they slowly and painfully die is just horrible. I know here in Canada, we have something in our rights that says something like 'Everyone has the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment and punishment" Do you think it's cruel to let someone stay alive for 2 maybe 3 years while they suffer?   Post and explain. 10 points if you explain yourself the best. :)

So me and my friends Paige, Kevin, and John were 4 way talking on the phone. xP Me and Paige were talking about her ex Eric.Eric said he likes me and she's encouraging me to go out with him. Paige is going out with John who is Eric's friend.       Paige had said I liked Eric and then Kevin heard it! I'm not sure if Kevin likes me but he won't tell me. He heard it and got mad and hung up the phone. Paige was just playing around because she has seen me and Eric flirting around and stuff. Kevin thought Paige was telling the truth.      Now Kevin won't talk to me. He said I "broke his heart". But the thing is I only like him as friends and that's it. When people ask if we were going out he would accept us as only friends.       But the thing is that I like Eric..So what should I do..?! I don't want to ruin my relationship with Kevin but I like Eric..

20090304100551AAQdaJS	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	What's the best way to get back at the noisy neighbors across the hall from me in my dorm?	SHORT AND SWEET:      I need a LEGAL, NON-DESTRUCTIVE, and especially FUNNY way of getting back at these kids who keep my from sleeping almost every night.        I was thinking of Super-Soakering them with vinegar or something, or maybe just getting loud speakers and blasting Hillary Duff at them.      They leave their doors open at night, and get really loud between 1:00 AM and 4:00 AM.      DETAILS:      Every night, the kids next to me and the kids across from them scream randomly, blast music, play video games, and just talk very loud from about 9:00 PM to 4:00 AM.  They leave their doors open, so it's even louder, especially echoing in the hallway.  They're noisy in the day, too.  Sometimes I go to sleep very early so I can fall asleep, but either one of their screams wakes me up or my roommate comes in at 2:00 or so wakes me up, and then I can't go to sleep until these kids shut up for the night.      - I tried telling the RA, but he's their friend, so he really doesn't care   - I tried asking them to shut their doors   - I tried asking them to keep it down      I really don't get it, there's this little pudgy half-Asian girl with thick glasses and an annoying laugh and wail, there's this fat kid who just randomly goes "waaaaaah!", there's this spoiled kid who cursed his mother off and has his phone conversations in front of my door (he wants to form a band like the Postal Service, his girlfriend breaking up with him really changed his outlook on life--I know the whole story), and they're all friends and they all get very loud at night.      It's really becoming a problem since I haven't gotten a solid 4 straight hours of sleep since I came to college, and I'm afraid to tell my parents because they'll just get pissed off.      What to do?      All suggestions are appreciated.      Thanks,   - Steve.

If you dont want any spoilers then stop reading here!            My projected winner of il$2: Myammee :(   I hate myammee.   But i think myammee wins and here is why.   In the super trailer you see a potential vault seen including    Sapphryi   It   Angelique   Prancer   Tailermade   20 Pack   Ice.   These people are on opposite teams at the moment so this has to be when teams are conjoined.   Now the following people are missing from that equation...   (of people who are still left on the show of course)   Buckwild   entertainer   myammee   bonez   heat.    In the thrown under the bus challenge you see all of those people who i listed in the vault along with myammee and buckwild.   I think buckwild goes home after the thrown under the bus challenge and myammee stays because... you see myammee in a challenge where you also see prancer involving crossing a beam, but those are the only two you see. All this seeing is me seeing these things in the super trailer which you yourself can watch.   In the supertrailer there is a little section showing myammee kneeling down in front of the mansion in work out clothes crying, i am assuming this is her after winning the final challenge.      I therefore feel that the elimination order goes as follows      heat   entertainer   bonez   buckwild   sapphryi   20 pack   angelique   it   tailermade   ice   prancer   WINNER-Myammee            Somebody please prove me wrong! I am an avid fan of the gold team alliance rather than the alternate alliance, and i would like to see buckwild win especially!!!!

When I was in middle school, I was one of the DJs for our news/radio show that we'd broadcast on the school's television system. We had a wide variety of different music, and one of the most popular songs of the time (this was 2002-2003) was a sort of a techo-pop song called "Oblivion" or something like that; despite usually having a good memory, I cannot remember who specifically sang the song. All I remember about the singer was that she had a relatively short name, or went by a short name.      Can anyone help?

20090304115710AANZ0hu	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Do you think "Love Hurts" by Incubus is a good song to add to a break up music list?	I disagree with the main part of the song, which says that a painful love is a good thing. Real love isn't supposed to hurt, and I feel like that line is encouraging people to stay in messed up relationships, but whatever.      Anyway, I like the part where he says, "Sometimes when I'm alone I wonder, Is there a spell that I am under, Keeping me from seeing the real thing"      I think this line helps people see that they stay in messed up relationships because they are under a spell, which they need to realize, so they can break the spell and get out.      When I was in a relationship, I knew what was wrong, but I couldn't really see it. Now that I'm out, I'm no longer under her spell, and when I think about it, I realize so much more now that she *really* didn't care about me. I couldn't really see it before, but I see it so clearly now      I also like the part where he says "without love, I won't survive" because people also need to realize they want to stay in their messed up relationship because they don't know how to survive without love.      So those are the two reasons I think I should add it, but the first reason, the main line of the song, is why I don't think I should add it. What do you guys think?      Thanks for the help.

20090304121708AAyL6jB	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	What is the Latin/Mexican guitar style of play referred to as?	I really enjoy the Latin/Mexican style of guitar music and I'd like to learn more about it.  I know there has to be a name for it besides "Mexican Guitar", but I have no idea what it is and my searches are turning up nothing.  Any information would be appreciated.  It's like the "Desperado" kind of Robert Rodriguez Chingon style...does that make sense?  Mariachi?  Flat picking?  Finger plucking?  Is it played on a classical guitar?  Thanks everyone!
